journalists sources and jail /.
a conversation with bob woodward about the cia leak investigation judith miller karl rove his long and tortured relationship with deep throat and trying to crack the secrecy surrounding the supreme court /.
welcome back to this one hour edition of reliable sources /.
with judith miller in jail and washington in an uproar over journalists protecting karl rove and other high level administration sources in the valerie plame leak investigation who better to check in with than bob woodward the author most recently of the secret man a new book about his relationship with the famous watergate source deep throat /.
here 's my conversation with the washington post assistant managing editor /.
judith miller in jail for protecting her sources an act of conscience ah paying a heavy price /.
but is n't there a minimal public sympathy for her because these sources were not exposing wrongdoing as deep throat did but outing a cia operative /?
um yes ah apparently /.
ah again i 'm not sure there 's any crime in all of this /.
um the special prosecutor 's been working eighteen months /.
uh eighteen months into watergate we knew about the tapes /.
people were in jail /.
people had pled guilty /.
in other words there was a solid evidentary trail /.
well but crime or not it looks like a bit of political dirty work /.
i do n't see it here /.
well i mean it may just be politics as usual /.
i mean rove 's ah defenders say look , the evidence is /-
and the evidence is ah that he was saying ah um joe wilson who was uh criticizing the administration on weapons of mass destruction really had an axe to grind and got his job because his wife had worked at the cia and recommended him /.
so there 's fuzziness to this /.
now it may turn out to be ah worse than watergate /.
ah but ah it does n't look that way now /.
all right i asked the new york times editor bill keller ah this past week about whether the newspaper and judy miller were acting above the law after losing in the courts /.
here 's what he had to say /. the above the law thing is a little gratuitous ah i think /. ah i mean the law presented judy miller with a choice she could betray her trust ah or she could go to jail /.
and she took what i believe is the brave and honorable choice /.
she went to jail /.
we ran out of law /.
could you have been subpeonaed ah and threatened with jail during watergate /.
or was the climate toward the press so much different then /?
well i do n't know that it 's different /.
ah assuredly carl berstein and i could 've been subpoenaed ah /.
did you worry about it /?
sure a little bit /.
but you know what happened ah /.
there were so many specifics in our stories ah about money and high level people in the white house and the nixon campaign that the prosecutors could subpoena them and get them to talk which eventually they did /.
and there were senate hearings when ah everyone testified in public /.
so you had ah very very different circumstances /.
so you know i agree with the editor of the new york times that ah this is not a perfect case judy miller /.
but the idea of the government and special prosecutors monkeying around with the relationship that reporters have with sources ah is a very very bad thing /.
and you look at the matt cooper business /.
and you know not to ah spend a lot of time on the details /.
pull a camera back /.
what 's going on here /.
but you know better than anyone there is an informal network of reporters and government people on both sides democrats republicans ah liberals conservatives who talk to reporters /.
and i may talk to somebody /.
and we will talk about ninety or a hundred subjects /.
what 's going on /. what do you hear /.
what does this look like /.
where is that going /.
what do n't we know /.
and then something comes up like this where suddenly you 're dealing with a covert operative /.
maybe you did n't expect the person to say that /.
but you 've given your word , you 've given your pledge , you 're going to protect this person /.
yes but when we learn all about this um i think very few people knew she was a covert operative in the cia , that she worked in the cia as a weapons of mass destruction analyst /.
so this is the kind of banter that goes on that helps the public and us figure out uh what the stories are , what 's being hidden ah what games are being played and so forth /.
in other words do n't underestimate the importance of these background or off the record conversations /.
/.
exactly it sounds kind of like a bs session /.
and some of it is /.
but it 's a vital lifeline to the underbelly of government /.
for the special prosecutor to come roaring in here with a tank and say ah you know i 'm going to destroy that and ah here look at judy miller , she never wrote a story about this this is totally ridiculous /.
right you mentioned karl rove /.
newsweek reports that he discussed plame /.
and we have the email now ah with matt cooper /.
new york times reports that karl rove discussed plame with carl novak /.
um does any of this reporting make you uncomfortable given all the books and articles written about who deep throat was that reporters are now going up to other reporters ' sources on this story /?
yeah sure and i think the prosecutor 's making a mistake /.
and i think the judge in the case should 've been much more rigorous in making the government really show they have evidence of a crime and they need this testimony /.
now it may turn out in the end to be very different /.
but all the discussions that rove had with these two reporters bob novak and matt cooper that we know about and there may have been others were not about valerie plame as a covert undercover cia operative whose identity had to be protected like the crown jewels /.
right /.
it was about somebody in the cia who was an analyst who got her husband this job to go to africa to see if they could find evidence of wh- /-
but her husband being a prominent white house critic who clearly the administration was angry at and wanted to /.
yeah sure but you know you know ah welcome to ah washington and politics /.
you 're saying it 's hardball /.
all right a- /- now the question is i mean /.
i 'm sorry /.
i wo n't answer it /.
you ah /-
/.
does this go beyond the boundaries of the normal interchange of information /?
based on what i 've seen does n't /.
and they 're cutting into it /.
and i think it 's a mistake /.
i wanted to ask you about scott mcclellan who as you know has been just uh eviscerated by reporters at the white house this week /.
let 's take a look at monday 's breifing and some of the questions about rove /.
scott i mean i mean this is ridiculous the notion that you 're going to stand before us after having commented with that level of detail and tell people watching this that somehow you 've decided not to talk /.
now that rove has in a sense been caught red - handed peddling this information all of a sudden you have respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation /?
does mcclellan 's role here remind you at all of the old nixon spokesman ron zeigler calling watergate a third - rate burglary and stonewalling to use a watergate term /?
is the administration stonewalling here /?
well /.
scott mcclellan is stonewalling and saying i 'm not going to answer /.
but he 's not denying things /.
he earlier said totally ridiculous /.
he earlier was doing /-
yeah but was involved in what /?
involved in criminal disclosure of this ah woman 's identity or involved in this free interchange ah /.
now i admit you know noone knows the answer to this /.
i do n't even think the special prosecutor knows the answer to this /.
so ah let 's wait and see /.
but here 's the lesson /.
be careful what you say ah particularly early in an inquiry /.
and what 's the main lesson of watergate /.
in these sort of uh scandals you know better than anyone /.
get the full story out completely at the start so they do n't have to drag it out of you /.
and that 's what we 're in /.
we 're in the dragging out phase /.
all right turning now to the secret man and your relationship with deep throat mark felt then the number two official in the fbi you grapple with the question of why did he do it , why did he risk his career to meet you in that parking garage /.
you 're still not sure /.
no i am /.
i lay out the reasons /.
but it 's layered you know like most human motivation /.
um there 're many um reasons /.
and they 're uh occurring simultaneously /.
but what outraged /-
yeah /. and in your question you have an assumption /.
did he risk his career /.
you see ah /-
was n't it dangerous /?
it was dangerous /.
but we set up these clandestine meetings ah and clandestine signals so he did n't have to risk his career /.
i was pledged to tell noone /.
he set up this system so noone would know that we were talking /.
and so as far as he was concerned yes there 's always risk in something like this /.
but he had taken such extreme care that there was minimal risk /.
let 's take a look at who most people think of when they think of deep throat /.
they think of hal holbrook and the movie all the president 's men /.
let 's watch /.
the story has stalled on us /.
and you thought i 'd help /?
i 'll never quote you /.
i would n't quote you even as an anonymous source /.
you 'd be on deep background /.
but of course in your book with carl bernstein and the movie you do describe a deep throat character /. did you have any reservations about that /.
were you betraying that agreement we just saw /?
ah no i really was n't because he also said that in the agreement was no disclosure but ah like all complicated relationships he said push me /.
i 've been a street agent in the fbi /.
and you do n't get anywhere unless you push people like hale /.
so go ahead /.
so there are two tracks absolute confidentiality but push to get as much information , confirm as much new information as possible /.
and ah when we wrote the book ah all the president 's men carl and i thought i mean how do you leave deep throat out /?
ah would 've been dishonest /.
ah we concealed his identity in a way ah that it remained confidential for more than thirty years after that book came out and it only was disclosed because mark felt his lawyer and family decided to disclose it /.
how did you feel when more recently you saw that fbi memo that he had signed saying that woodward and berstein were reporting half - truths and fiction and we need to find the leakers this at the very time when he was meeting privately and secretly with you kind of duplicitous /.
yes it 's very duplicitous yes /.
but it 's also very careful because it was addressing a specific story that he was not a source of /.
and in the memo he says yes clearly ah they have access to fbi or justice department sources /.
and then in the process of this leak investigation which he is running he finds the leakers somebody in the white house and presumably one of the assistant prosecutors he alleges /.
so it 's perfect /.
ah and he sends this memo to the acting fbi director al patrick grey /.
and then they send a message to the attorney general ah saying you know case closed we found out who did it /.
it 's perfect /.
counter-intelligence it 's very sophisticated /.
it 's what somebody would do who was a soviet spy or a spy in the kremlin for us /.
right /.
now in nineteen seventy eight felt was convicted later pardoned ah of authorizing black - bag jobs against weathermen underground radicals /.
um did that change your view of him /?
i mean here supposedly he 'd been outraged by nixon white house corruption in dealing with you /.
and yet he engaged in some of it himself /.
yes that 's right /.
and his justification was that there was a security threat /.
but there 's always a security threat /.
um but it is different because what nixon was doing was for political purposes political intelligence um /.
the weathermen were violent /.
there 's no question about it /.
i do n't think they posed a threat to the republic that clearly at this moment mark felt and some other people in the fbi thought /.
you write ah here bob woodward that the portrait of me is not all that admirable /.
and you say that you lied to richard cohen the washington post columnist and your colleague ah who wanted to write a column this was twenty years ago saying that he thought felt was deep throat /.
why did n't you just say i 'm not going to talk about it as you did when most journalists asked /?
because he had the initials on the memo which were mf mark felt and he knew carl berstein 's wife and he was going to assert it with the kind of authority that is rare not rare for richard as a columnist but uh that this was a fact /.
and this was a sensitive time /.
this was when felt was on trial /.
this was ah either before or right after , he had been pardoned by ronald reagan /.
i had to protect the source /.
and cohen was persistant /.
i could n't stop him without lying /.
i lied /.
i regret doing that /.
and i 've apologized to him since /.
and he said well of course you lied /.
you have to protect the source /.
ah it was just one column /.
all right we need to take a break /.
when we come back , was mark felt capable of informed consent in releasing his long held secret to the world /?
we 'll ask bob woodward that question next /.
cnn tonight at seven /.
after terrorist target london how 's the rest of the world winning the war on terror /?
then at eight an all new progress report on the war on terror /.
go beyond the headlines starting with cnn tonight seven eastern /.
welcome back to reliable sources /.
we 're talking to bob woodward about his new book on deep throat /.
for years you were tempted to call mark felt and to renew and perhaps repair your relationship with him /.
you say you were gutless and you did n't do it /.
why /?
yeah i was gutless um because you know he had gone through this trial , it looked like ten years in jail ah he was devastated and ah /-
and he 'd been cold toward you /.
yeah yeah he was not happy with the book and the movie ah /.
but the main thing is this was a guy ah whose liberty was in jeopardy for about three or four years /.
he was pardoned by reagan /.
and i felt he dodged a bullet /.
ah his wife was ill /.
ah she died i think in nineteen eighty four /.
and then he went out to live with his daughter /.
and i felt look ah his life is fine /.
he 's happy /.
i 've got other things to do /.
ah i know what happened /.
he knows ah what happened /.
what 's the loop to close /.
and then ah very belatedly five years ago i went to see him /.
and his memory is gone /.
/.
but there is still that wonderful kind of human connection that 's almost ah primal /.
ah he recognized who i was /.
yeah yeah very emotional /.
/.
but when you talk about his memory he did n't even remember this was five years ago or barely remembered that richard nixon had resigned /.
looms large in all of our memories /. so was it surprising shocking disappointing frustrating that he remembered so little /?
let me r- /-
yes that 's right /.
sad sad sad /.
yeah /.
and my regret is i did n't get out there sooner and sit down with him and say look we need to talk about this /.
what more is there to it /.
how did the signals work /.
ah what are some of the things you were thinking /.
same time i know a lot about his motive of frustration and uh you know reckless uh law - breaking going on in the nixon white house uh the level of lawbreaking which we have not seen since and i hope we never see again /.
i mean he saw it /.
and he was willing to help /. but he was willing to help in a way /.
he did n't look at himself as a leaker /.
i think in a sense ah he did n't look at himself as the deep throat who was kind of this person who came forward /.
the swashbuckling source /.
he was guiding you /.
but he would n't volunteer information /.
yeah he was careful /.
he was careful /. and you know this was a j edgar hoover man /.
and i think we may find out someday ah i hope we do that he studied at the feet of the master hoover who did things like this a lot /.
/.
but was he capable now at the age of ninety one of giving informed consent to go public /.
or did you decide you were just not going to push him even if it meant that vanity fair or somebody else got that story first /?
well i ah consulted ben bradley the former editor of the post /.
and he said you really ca n't get informed consent /.
i ah consulted the best lawyer in town bob barnett /.
ah and he went through it and said you need voluntary absolute and ah competent ah declaration on his part that you were ah released from this agreement /.
and there was no way to get it ah given mark felt 's state of mind /.
so i backed off /.
all right bob woodward /.
stay put /.
when we come back did n't everyone in the press say that william rehnquist was about to retire as cheif justice /?
we 'll ask woodward about that in a moment /.
welcome back to our conversation with bob woodward /.
speculation about the cheif justice of the united states got out of control this past week /.
many believe it 's just a matter of time before chief justice william rehnquist steps down /.
my source tells me that he is going to retire and the time of retiring is going to be as soon as the president is back in the country as soon as air force one lands in the country /.
what everyone believes and i guess i do agree with this is that the cheif justice will now step down this week , that there will be two vacancies /.
rehnquist of course now saying he has no plans to ah step down /.
was n't this the press that had speculated worse /?
yeah it was /.
and ah kind of stupidly so /.
ah i mean there is a way to say look he 's ill /.
ah people are claiming they have inside information /.
but i thought ah rehnquist said it best when somebody asked him recently and said it 's for me to know and you to find out /.
i remember hearing that phrase first in third grade /.
/.
now you wrote a book about the supreme court the brethren /.
at the time rehnquist was on the supreme court /.
five justices cooperated with you you 've said /.
rehnquist was one of them /?
i 'm not saying /.
we do n't disclose our sources /.
so there 's still deep throats on the court /?
that 's right /.
and you know we still protect sources who ah were justices or are justices perhaps /.
but you have lewis powell was one of your sources because he 's passed away /.
yes yes he 's deceased /.
and it 's very interesting having a supreme court justice who 's a confidential source /.
ah someday when my notes on this are released you will see supreme court justices saying come in the back door /. ah ah do n't quote a justice because somebody will say which son of a bitch talked /.
/.
why do n't justices talk on the record /?
i mean it 's this kind of secretive shadowy institution /.
um should they give more interviews to people like you /?
oh of course oh yes /.
i think we need more sunlight on all institutions /.
and that 's why scott armstrong and i did the book ah on the supreme court /.
ah people now realize that lots of the justices ' papers are avaliable how incredibly accurate and carefully that book was done /.
all right well i love the idea of justices spinning you on background at least trying to get their version of the truth out /.
ah just breifly ah mark felt ah we were talking about he 's made his own book and movie deal /.
ah can you see tom hanks playing deep throat in the next movie /?
um anything 's possible /.
maybe he 'll be playing karl rove in the next movie /.
who knows ah /. funny things happen /.
but i think ah felt 's lawyer and family can do ah something that 's going to add to the record on all of this /.
all right we 'll wait and see /.
bob woodward thanks for joining us /.
thank you /.
we 'll be right back /.
at 3:42 on july 28 , 1976 , a strong earthquake hit tangshan .
on the morning of the 28th , the national earthquake administration called an emergency consultative meeting .
at the meeting , huang xiangning read the earthquake prediction that they had previously issued . this attracted the attention of people in the relevant fields .
at 10:30 p.m. , as huang xiangning was preparing to return home , he was met by people who led him away from the door of his home , and that night he reported to the country 's leaders on earthquake forecasting .
what sort of questions did hua guofeng ask then ? who else was there ?
oh , , when i went in , there was , uh , mei shirong , the deputy director , he was the deputy director of the analysis and forecasting office in charge of , and director liu yingyong , that is the seismology bureau director at that time , they were both there .
as he reached the end of the report , mei shirong said , he thought he wanted --
the tangshan earthquake was a paroxysmal earthquake .
this type of earthquake has no precursors , and so it ca n't be predicted and you ca n't take precautions .
uh , that was the gist of mei shirong 's remarks at the end of the report .
but before this , you clearly had already reported this opinion to the analysis and forecasting office .
the report went to the seismology bureau , yes . how could he say this ?
this is absolutely contrary to the facts . well , i do n't know , , could it be , uh , that -lrb- he -rrb- was afraid that the responsibility was too much , so -lrb- he -rrb- blabbered out of a frightened mentality .
that 's my guess , maybe it was what he was thinking under frightening circumstances .
after i went there , after he finished the report , premier hua allowed me to report .
when i saw what was going on , i took the annual forecast , and i had no report .
so , i went directly to discussing our short - term annual forecast , it was july 14 , , i put it down on the table , and let them , read the original once , and then i reported , and they did n't interrupt at all .
i finished , and hua guofeng then said , uh , the party central committee 's state council does not hold you comrades in earthquake industry responsible , we hope you will continue to do your monitoring and forecasting work to protect the party central committee and protect chairman mao .
that was what they said .
but obviously what you said , the facts you stated , conflicted with what mei shirong had stated .
yes .
at the time , did n't anyone express any dissatisfaction over this ?
no .
oh , , they did n't raise any questions about this .
and no one suggested looking into the responsibility of the earthquake administration ?
no , they did n't .
uh , , uh , um , , the gist of what he said was that no one 's responsibility would be looked into .
he said , you need n't have any concerns .
, , uh , when you go back , continue with your monitoring work , monitoring and aftershocks .
and protect the party central committee and protect chairman mao .
that was the gist of what hua guofeng said .
who else was in attendance at the time ?
in attendance , uh , from the seismology bureau there were three of us , director liu yingyong , deputy director mei shirong , and me .
, the national leaders were hua guofeng ,
oh , there was jiang qing ,
there was ji dengkui , there was wu de .
this was an informational briefing that hardly anyone knows about .
the time was january 20 , 1977 .
the briefing only had a total of 450 copies ; it was mainly committee leaders at the time who were reported to .
in the briefing , the national seismology bureau for the first time analyzed the reasons for the failure to report the tangshan earthquake .
the national seismology bureau believes , first , that it did not clearly recognize the relationship between anomalies and earthquakes , and it made errors in assessing the earthquake .
second , it did not recognize pre-earthquake anomalous signs .
third , it did not understand the seismological and geological signs in the beijing , tianjin , tangshan , bohai , zhangjiakou area . these three " lack of understandings " made people feel quite a bit of guilty conscience .
were the reasons that led to so many deaths and injuries all that simple ?
the reports from the monitoring stations , the experts ' opinions all failed to be taken seriously by the relevant departments ; what kind of questions did this raise ?
and if the pre-quake predictions had been taken seriously , what result would that have led to ?
these are the relics and ruins left to us by the great tangshan earthquake .
in that calamity , all of tangshan was laid waste .
and yet in the county seat of qinglong county in hebei province , although it is only 115 km from here , not even one person in the whole county died in the great earthquake .
on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the great tangshan earthquake , that is in april of 1996 , qinglong was chosen by a united nations agency to become a successful model for the integration of scientific research and administrative management .
in fact , on august 20 , 1976 , the hebei science committee had issued a brief report which for the first time revealed the facts about qinglong having successfully prepared against the great tangshan earthquake .
but the report was withdrawn very quickly .
right up until 1995 , when the united nations ' dr. kohl came to beijing to participate in the world conference on women and learned about qinglong for the first time .
the following year , after receiving permission from the chinese government , this female un official headed up a team in person and conducted an on - site investigation in qinglong .
beginning at that time , the qinglong phenomenon gradually became known to the outside .
speaking of the qinglong miracle , there are two people we can not forget ; one is wang chunqing and the other is ran guangqi .
at the time wang chunqing was in charge of seismic work for the qinglong county scientific committee , and it was he who first brought news of the great earthquake back to qinglong .
what do you think the reasons were ? why was qinglong able to do it and tangshan was n't ?
oh !
that 's really difficult to explain in a few words .
why do you say that ?
qinglong ! at the time i was participating , on july 14 , 1976 , i was participating in a joint survey and prevention conference .
the local manager was wang chunqing , the person responsible for running the qinglong county scientific committee was named wang chunqing .
he was also on the dais opening the conference .
opening this conference , at the time , wang chengmin of the national seismology bureau came .
when wang chengmin came , he demanded to address the conference , and he spoke to the bureau 's director , zha zhiyuan : i want to address the conference .
zha zhiyuan would n't let him .
what the reason for that was never became known . he wanted to make a pre-quake speech , and he would n't allow it .
what was the reason ?
what reason ? he was the deputy director of the bureau , he was a group leader .
wang chengmin thereupon spent two evenings holding two colloquia . , wang chunqing participated in the first colloquium .
, uh , he participated in this meeting from start to finish .
ah .
wang chengmin then reported the pre-quake opinions of a number of units . pre-quake opinions that he had received .
he received these opinions and also heard that tangshan second middle school said so ,
uh , teacher tian jinwu of tangshan second middle school also said like that , that is , earthquake prediction is part of the three essential earthquake requisites , right ?
in late july or early august a 7.0 or higher , possibly even an 8.0 earthquake will occur , and this made a very strong impression on him .
when the meeting let out , wang chunqing dared not delay , and he hurriedly made the long journey to his hometown , qinglong , because his home was in qinglong .
at the time ran guangqi was serving as qinglong county secretary and county head .
after receiving wang chunqing 's report , ran guangqi immediately convened the county 's standing committee to discuss the earthquake situation .
at that time , with the upper levels of government not having issued any earthquake prediction , it was he that faced the risk of losing his position and on july 25 made a decision , that he had to notify everyone of the earthquake situation before july 26 .
from that moment , all of qinglong county went into pre-earthquake mode .
after learning of this , what was ran guangqi , as county secretary and county head , thinking and doing ?
we had to take the initiative in this .
uh , the wolf came , and whose child did he carry off ?
it 's the lives of 470,000 people , is n't it ?
is n't it ?
the worst case scenario would be losing -lrb- his -rrb- office !
it did not matter .
right . that was one thing .
the second thing was , criticizing deng .
criticizing deng , we could put it that way ; the serious matter of criticizing deng , we did n't dare not to do , because that was a call from above !
right ! a call from above , they were calling on us to criticize deng , so we criticized deng .
but we were talking to the ordinary people , and there 's no difference between criticizing at home and criticizing in the courtyard .
what 's the difference ? we were out trying to do earthquake prevention , so we just went on criticizing deng outside !
our supervisors checked up on us and learned that we were outside criticizing deng .
that was one problem , they were thinking like that .
ha , the third thing was , we were really dealing with a major quake .
if there 's no quake , the ordinary people will just see that we 're imperfect .
the mosquito sees a few welts and comes back again , right ?
the ordinary people will call us a few bad names , when it becomes worse , we bow and leave the stage .
but if we did n't issue an earthquake prediction and there was a real earthquake , we 'd be embarrassed in front of the locals .
maybe you do n't acknowledge the debt , but you 'd feel bad about it .
ran guangqi examined the matter thoroughly , and under these circumstances he was decisive and issued an earthquake prediction , and he did n't tell anyone he was doing it . so basically it was not recorded at the province level .
so i issued the prediction .
if there was no earthquake , that 's fine , at worst i 'd lose my position .
other people had black gauze caps , and they looked at them as black gauze caps ; i had a black gauze cap , and i treated it as a stupid turtle . that 's the original saying .
on november 8 , 1976 , the national seismology bureau released its seventeenth seismic report .
the report said that the tangshan earthquake had damaged 180,000 homes in qinglong county , with 7,300 of these collapsing , but only one person had died as a direct result of the earthquake .
the kailuan mine bureau was another miracle .
the miracle was that 10,000 miners working in kailuan mine bureau mines successfully escaped danger in the great tangshan earthquake , and this established a model for disaster prevention and preparation .
perhaps there are more lessons to be learned from kailuan than from qinglong .
with seismologists being unable to set a date for an imminent earthquake , how can people carry out effective disaster prevention and preparation work ?
when the great tangshan earthquake hit , why was it that the kailuan mine was able to keep the mortality rate at only 0.07 % ?
i went down in the mines once , and i thought about this , under those circumstances , their miners , if a real earthquake hits , if they do n't get them out of there very quickly , that 's a horrendous thing .
why ?
, in a mine , if the power goes out , the power goes out and there 's no ventilation .
if the power goes out and the ventilation stops , in 40 minutes or so , , uh , gas , underground flooding , uh , that can quickly threaten human life .
-lrb- power -rrb- outage , -lrb- ventilation -lrb- stop , if the power goes out and the ventilation stops for more than forty minutes , so everything has to be done in that time frame .
otherwise , it 's very difficult to ensure their life safety .
before the great tangshan earthquake , the kailuan mine bureau did a lot of work to establish feasible measures to ensure that underground miners safely escape dangers .
the kailuan mine bureau set up an earthquake preparedness leadership group , organized at various levels , right .
what employees in critical departments were supposed to do , right , what the leaders in critical departments were supposed to do , it was all clearly spelled out .
in this document . it 's all clearly spelled out .
so when the big earthquake was near , they did n't panic , they were able to bring the miners back up safely .
so only seven men died .
the kailuan mine bureau , following the principle that it is better to have a thousand days without an earthquake than one day of unpreparedness , and based on the idea that there will be an earthquake , a large earthquake , and soon , constantly focused on underground earthquake - proofing work .
moreover , they did n't stop with written earthquake preparedness measures ; they transferred a lot of human and physical resources to carry out shoring - up and maintenance work aboveground and underground .
so in terms of the kailuan mine bureau , they certainly did n't pin all their hopes on someone issuing an earthquake forecast .
what they did pin their hopes on was , i do n't care what day the earthquake occurs on , i 'm not afraid .
every day , maybe they said , taking this whatchamacallit , i mean .
it 's like , they were kind of thinking , let 's maintain this army for a thousand days even if we only use it for one hour .
, , every day you have an earthquake and , , i just do what i 'm supposed to do .
what do i mean when i say i just do what i 'm supposed to do ?
from %pw , on the day they established the earthquake office , they began paying attention to earthquake forecasting .
their focus on earthquake forecasting was , i mean , whenever the earthquake hits , the kailuan mine bureau says we have to assure the miners underground .
it 's no good if we ca n't , , get the miners back up .
when the great tangshan earthquake hit , the kailuan mine bureau was situated in the extreme quake zone .
eight mines and one under construction were all in the 9 to 11 intensity zone .
more than 70 % of the buildings collapsed or were seriously damaged ; the power grid , the transport system and mineshaft elevators , ventilation and drainage facilities were severely damaged .
at the time , about half the kailuan miners were stuck underground .
in the moment that the earthquake hit , how could they be gotten out ?
at the time , how to get them out , , , at the time , this involved several problems , very typical ones .
um , for example , , the lu jiatuo mine had a vertical - shaft ladder , and at the time there were more than a thousand people in the mine , male , female , old and young .
at the time it seemed like , the mine 's deputy manager , jia bangyou , he was very calmly commanding over a thousand people , keeping them not panicked .
first thing was avoiding panic , at every level , whatever responsibility was to be shouldered , you had to shoulder it , we just spoke about that , so there was a clear division of labor .
more than a thousand people , you can imagine if there was n't excellent organization , a few would get trampled .
i was thinking , a few will get trampled .
at the time , jia bangyou said , go to a station at the mine 's mouth , women comrades come up first .
after all the women comrades had gone up , the new workers went up .
there were regulations , , they had it in the document in writing , new workers go up .
after the new workers had all gone up , the experienced older workers went up .
finally , the ccp members came up last , and at the time jia bangyou said , ccp members come up last .
at the mouth of the mine , the people who had come up first did n't leave , they stayed right there , enduring the aftershocks , and they waited right through to past 8:00 a.m. .
jia bangyou finally came back up to the surface safely .
not one of the lu jiatuo mine 's underground personnel had been lost ; more than a thousand people escaped death deep underground in this dangerous situation .
they created an inspiring miracle underground , but it was not by accident .
i really admire this group of ccp members who were at the lu jiatuo mine in 1976 .
the ccp members who were at the lu jiatuo mine in 1976 were the last to come up .
uh , after they had come up , no one at the mouth of the mine had left .
why ?
their mine boss , jia bangyou , had not yet come up .
men , women , old and young were all at the mouth of the mine , not going anywhere .
jia bangyou came up , took a look at the crowd , all waiting there quietly , and he was very moved at that time .
he said , go on ! all of you go home ! go see whether your families are still alive .
!
qinglong county successfully issued the imminent earthquake warning , and 470,000 people in the entire county got through the disaster unscathed .
the kailuan mine bureau has lost only seven out of 10,000 of its mine workers , which is a miracle of disaster preparedness .
and in the final analysis their success was manifested in their focusing on earthquakes .
possibly we should say , if , before the quake , the relevant national departments had taken seriously the news of the earthquake forecast , would the casualties have been so high ?
if it had been , it would n't have been such a tragedy .
there simply would n't have been such a tragedy . if there had been communication at all levels , and the people of tangshan had been warned . uh , even if you do n't have a definite date .
you ca n't determine july 28 at 3:42 , that 's impossible .
but there 's an approximate time frame , when the relatively big earthquake will probably occur , and that kind of a notice ought to be given out .
and what exactly do you think was the reason that this was n't done ?
the precise reason it was n't done , you could say there were many factors involved .
but the main factor , i believe , is that it was n't taken seriously enough at the time , it was n't taken seriously enough .
even though the tangshan seismic monitoring network had , so many earthquake warning signs , uh ,
every province and city has so many emergency reporting offices , look at tianjin , beijing , hebei , they all have emergency reporting stations .
, they all had earthquake forecast opinions , but they did n't attract enough attention .
when you did your investigation , and you discovered that at the time china 's level was such as to be able to predict this earthquake , what did you think ?
how can i explain this ?
in earthquake forecasting , success means succeeding in your probing of the situation , and failure means failing in your probing .
, i mean , the national seismology bureau should have predicted this earthquake coming .
rather , it 's in , the attitudes of some of the officials of the national seismology bureau .
for example , , you take seriously , you come , your underlings forcefully request a meeting , you meet with them and you do it .
if you ca n't make a decision , it 's a matter of your level .
some of our officials are n't -- this is also an issue that perplexes a lot of people , why is it that the masses ' community monitoring stations can pick up abnormal data , but the specialists , the experts , do n't detect anything ?
all i can say is , this is the sadness of 240,000 wronged souls of tangshan .
really .
the local people all saw it coming .
this book of mine , uh , on the title page i write , i wrote this for the people of the tangshan earthquake monitoring network ; i respectfully represent the 240,000 dead .
i really wrote that i represented the dead , i do n't represent the living .
i respectfully represent the 240,000 tangshan dead , and to the people of the former tansghan , earthquake monitoring network , you predicted the great tangshan earthquake , you reported the emergency , you made every effort .
you are the pride of the people of your home town !
we love you ! and we pray for you !
in your view , is it more important to maintain social stability in the region around the capital , or is it more important that a major earthquake may cost the lives of many people ?
, in my view , of course it 's human life , definitely more important than anything else , that is my final appeal in my book .
my appeal , one , this one , this one little crux .
life is more important than anything else !
regardless whether you 're , any country , any region , any race , any political party , people 's dignity , people 's lives are more important than anything else .
this has always been the pain in the hearts of many chinese seismologists .
before the great tangshan earthquake , china had medium - long - range forecasts , it had annual forecasts , it had imminent forecasts . but in the end , the tragic result was that 240,000 people lost their lives .
we should say there is a profound lesson in this .
why do you believe that the leaders involved need to take responsibility for this ?
maybe for them it was just an inadvertent mistake , or an oversight .
i believe they ought to , , have held a meeting , and maybe reduced the losses .
therefore the tangshan earthquake , i still say , we are not at the levels , , to forecast on time , on july 28 , 1976 , at approximately 3:42 .
but we are at the level where we can say , in late july or early august , in that week of time ,
, this all could have been said .
we 're not at the level to report that tangshan city , the small area of fengnan in tangshan , but we can report for the beijing , tianjin , tangshan and zhangjiakou area .
, we have already , very clearly said that .
we ca n't correctly predict a 7.8 earthquake , but we can forecast an above 5.0 , even above 6.0 , or even that not excluding a 7.0 earthquake , that we can say .
if you look at the tangshan disaster records , many people might get the impression that the great tangshan earthquake was not just a natural disaster , but that it was made up of many human disasters . how do you see that ?
, , , it 's a question i ca n't answer clearly here , i mean , to be precise , , in addition to a natural disaster it 's also a human disaster .
that included at the time , , in terms of politics , certainly some campaigns like the gang of four , had an effect , , that 's one thing .
but , i mean , people who are responsible for the earthquake - related decision - making , they did n't do their duty and their responsibility to their utmost .
the price paid for the great tangshan earthquake was 240,000 lives tragically lost , and that will forever be part of history ; what lessons should mankind learn from this great disaster ?
can the tragedy of the great tangshan earthquake ever be repeated ?
what is even more unexpected is that two chinese seismologists who precisely predicted the tangshan quake and who have spent a lifetime doing earthquake research coincidentally believe that china has not made progress in earthquake forecasting levels , but has actually gone backwards .
if the thing were to , happen in today 's china , do you think disaster could be avoided ?
now it could not be avoided , now china does n't have , uh , this capacity .
so in terms of china , it does n't have this capacity .
in today 's china the level of earthquake forecasting , i believe , compared to before the tangshan earthquake , has fallen , has slipped by a wide margin .
if we were once again to continue focusing on earthquake preparedness as before premier zhou died , with the policy of the experts and the masses working together , and combining chinese and foreign methods , then , earthquake forecasting would be on the right track again .
now we 're , out of two legs , missing one leg .
experts and the masses working together , with the masses monitoring and working on preparedness , it 's all , been weakened .
and that 's very disturbing .
looking at it in terms of the great tangshan earthquake , monitoring and preparedness by the masses and monitoring of ground stress have already been proven ; they should be effective , so why are n't they being taken seriously ?
but that ca n't be , , the seismology bureau system , uh , acknowledges , oh !
in the , '80s , exactly which year i 'm not sure , a conference was held in quanzhou , we who believe in monitoring and preparedness by the masses call it the three earths , earth electricity , earth stress , and earth magnetism , they denied it all .
i say the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses used before the tangshan quake , and methods that produced this prediction .
and also before an earthquake in coastal cities , the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses , in
dongguan gets down to business taiwan firms embrace a cantonese boomtown
from hong kong 's airport , you can go straight to dongguan on a global express bus . with 27 departures a day , these buses run by a taiwan firm out of dongguan take taiwan expats to their adopted home , which boasts the largest concentration of taiwan firms in the prc .
invoking the taiwanese business battle cry of " victory to those who strive the hardest , " 20,000 - 30,000 taiwan expats in dongguan have in little more than a decade turned a county of banana and lichee plantations into a big city with exports behind only shenzhen 's and shanghai 's .
how has dongguan , this rising economic star , done it ?
what mix of sad and happy tales about taiwan firms does this city have to tell ?
it 's 10:00 at night , but the city of dongguan in guangdong province is still hopping . cars clocking 80 kilometers an hour zip along roads that reveal hardly a trace of the farming villages that they linked not long ago . taiwanese business people here run their factories like they drive their cars , in high gear . the factories are lit up at night for overtime shifts .
" we do n't take much of a break for the chinese new year 's holidays , " says andrew yeh , chairman of dongguan 's powin electric , which makes cable for the telecoms industry .
" by the morning of the third day we start up again with three shifts , just like any other day .
we ca n't keep up with our orders and have got to squeeze five days of work into every 24 hours . " in the busy fucheng district , you find the taiwanese bars , covered from door to rooftop with flashing lights
. the lights , like the karaoke singing within them , pulsate until dawn no matter the season . inside there is a raucous crowd . a taiwanese businessman down from harbin boasts that his auto plant up in the northeast sits on a lot as vast as taipei city and has a green light to sell on the domestic market .
in another room a taiwanese businessman based in dongguan carouses with a party cadre from yunnan who is trying to attract investment . ju gao - jeng , a former roc legislator who now has an academic post in beijing , is talking to a reporter from taipei about the roc presidential elections - a hot topic of conversation on both sides of the taiwan strait .
amid all the merrymaking , one gets a sense of what shanghai must have been like in the thirties . in dongguan at the turn of the 21st century , however , it is the taiwanese business people who have been playing the leading roles .
high concentration of taiwan firms
before the 21st century had even arrived , a bright economic star had risen over southern china .
ever since economic reforms accelerated on the mainland when deng xiaoping made a tour of the south in early 1992 , four southern cantonese cities - zhongshan , dongguan , shunde , and nanhai - have earned a reputation as the " four tigers " of guangdong province .
dongguan leads the pack . " the year before last its total exports were third on the mainland , trailing only shenzhen 's and shanghai 's , " says jiang suwu , a graduate of wuhan university 's chinese department who came south to work in the planning department of a taiwan firm in dongguan . " it had more than 15,000 foreign , taiwan , and hong kong firms , and economic growth for that year reached 26 % . "
in ancient times dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort yang guifei . just a little more than a decade ago dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . it has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 taiwan firms .
chang han - wen , the chairman of the taiwan business association of dongguan -lrb- tbad -rrb- , says that development started in the late 1980s . hong kong firms , with their proximity and fluent cantonese -lrb- also the local dialect in dongguan -rrb- , were first . the taiwanese , first coming about 1989 , followed . each arrival seemed to bring many more on its heels .
taiwan firms are now the most important source of foreign investment in dongguan . consider the booming electronics industry . eighty percent of dongguan 's 1,800 computer - related companies are from taiwan , hong kong and macau . in terms of production value , they account for at least half of this rmb 50 billion local industry .
dongguan holds the highest concentration of taiwan firms anywhere on the mainland .
according to tbad statistics , there are now 30,000 taiwanese companies on the mainland , -lrb- official prc statistics , which include service - industry firms , put the number at 45,000 -rrb- . guangdong province can boast one - third of the total , of which 3,200 are in dongguan .
most of these are telecom , cable , plastics , shoes , electronics and electric machinery companies .
why has dongguan been such a magnet for taiwan firms ?
kao wen - lai points out that dongguan is strategically located between shenzhen and guangzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and accessible to the entire pearl river delta . it is three hours by car to hong kong and one and a half hours by boat to humen . when compared to shenzhen , moreover , land and labor in dongguan are cheap .
" the local cadres have been smart , providing all manner of land and tax incentives , " says chen ming - chih , tbad 's secretary general .
two keys to the miracle one afternoon in the days before the chinese new year , chinese businessmen wearing suits arrived at the people 's government administration building in dongguan 's qishi district .
after a long wait , they sat down at a table to negotiate with qishi 's communist party secretary , the district chief , and various staff from its foreign economic office . qishi 's factory rents , electricity charges and land leases were all focuses of discussion .
tbad , as is frequently the case , introduced the two parties .
" the factory rent was set at rmb 8.00 -lrb- about nt$ 32 -rrb- a square meter . the electricity charge was rmb .87 a kilowatt hour , and there were various tax incentives , " explains wang jung - tuo , who notes there is still room for negotiation . all in all , it was a very attractive package . in 1990 , wang went to malaysia thinking about opening a factory there , but he discovered that malaysia 's market was much smaller than the mainland 's and its labor costs twice as high .
the style of life was too different there , there was a language divide , and the roads were poor . the mainland was a much better fit for him and his printed circuit boards company . now , little more than a decade later , its 20 - 30 workers have grown to 2,000 . the company is once again preparing to expand its physical plant .
he acknowledges that it was a risky move to come to mainland china , but " if you 're going to die , you might as well die among your own people . " he traces his ancestry to guangdong and affirms that his decision to set up in mainland china " involves ethnic pride . "
although low land and labor costs are dongguan 's main attractions , taiwan firms also choose the locale for the networks of people and producers that have been built up among taiwanese in dongguan over the last ten years .
these two kinds of networks , says h.d. yeh - who served as tbad 's president for two terms - were instrumental in creating the " taiwanese economic miracle . "
h.d. yeh points out that competition in the 21st century is all about speed . when customers in america make purchase orders , the whole process , including drawing up the contract and manufacturing the goods , requires four months . but taiwanese firms can deliver in 15 days . " there are two keys , " he says .
" one is that all the upstream and downstream factories are here . you can assemble a computer completely from parts made within 50 kilometers . " and the second key is that when you deal with taiwanese companies , you do n't have to endure a long contract process .
everything starts rolling with a single telephone call . taiwanese business people are always playing golf , singing karaoke or chewing betel nut together .
" everyone is always asking how everyone else is doing - it 's a way of networking and building up good relations , " yeh says .
andrew yeh recalls that when the company first set up in dongguan in 1990 , " even screws had to be brought in from taiwan . " but now the company sources virtually all of the necessary raw materials and parts on the mainland and is reliant for very little on taiwan .
" what does industrial emigration entail ? usually it means downstream industries coming first , forcing the mid-stream industries to follow , " says sylvia yang , deputy chairperson of tbad 's women 's division .
and in dongguan downstream taiwan firms have expanded into the mid-stream , becoming more vertically integrated .
tahsin printing only made paper boxes in taiwan but when they set up a plant in dongguan they discovered that it was hard to obtain the paper rolls they needed and thus learned how to make them themselves . now the company makes paper boxes both from rolled paper and from colored flat paper . to each its own domain many companies have expanded into new business realms in dongguan . a frequently cited example is primax , h.d. yeh 's electronics firm .
the company rented a factory in dongguan in 1989 and at first produced labor - intensive power surge protectors .
after three years , they began in 1992 to invest massively on the mainland , establishing computer mouse production lines .
thereafter , primax launched new products every year : cellular phone parts , overhead projectors , paper shredders , scanners . . . constantly expanding its product lines and production capacity , primax expanded from a single dongguan plant with 25 workers in 1989 to its current nine factories and 4,000 - plus workforce .
primax 's performance , h.d. yeh notes , pushed its mother company in taiwan to go public seven years ago . primax is one of the few taiwan electronics companies with a definite " china orientation . "
" it does n't cost much to set up a factory in mainland china , and shipping times are stable . these are helpful to the mother company both in terms of controlling costs and filling large orders , " says yeh .
dongguan hsu fu chi foods , which sells candy , cakes and candied fruit in the mainland domestic market , is another good example .
they began production there in 1992 , formally opening their own plant in dongguan in 1994 . the company now has three factories in dongguan , with a combined area of 120,000 square meters , that produce 200 tons of candy , 70 tons of chinese - style cakes , and 180 tons of gelatin and pudding a day .
" we produce 300 - 500 container loads of food a month . you can find our cakes in supermarkets all the way from guangzhou to tibet . " norman hsu , the company 's vice president , says that after one invests on the mainland , layouts of taiwan factories seem exceedingly cramped .
" there 's a totally different sense of space . " " dongguan is by itself one - thirteenth the size of taiwan , " notes chen ming - chih , secretary general of the taiwan business association . in dongguan factories are more than ten times the sizes of similar plants in taiwan .
one factory building at the talingshan furniture plant is 380 meters long .
walking the perimeter of a leading electronics plant in qishi is " like playing four holes of golf . " like soldiers , workers often have to take different shifts in the cafeteria .
the pouchen shoe plant , dongguan 's largest , employs 100,000 . the compound has a nursery , hospital and an operating room . " we always jokingly refer to it as fort pouchen , " says yeh .
victory to the strivers although the taiwan firms in dongguan have left home , their success can largely be attributed to an ethos they transplanted from taiwan - that " victory goes to those who strive the hardest . "
" in taiwan , we used to take the children somewhere fun on weekends and holidays , " says chang mei - liang of tbad 's women 's division .
but since she 's moved the factory , " there has n't been a single meal the whole family has eaten together . "
if you want to open a plant on the mainland , you 're going to have to sacrifice family intimacy . "
in taiwan , a boss just has to set the factory 's basic course and at the very most supervise the executives , " explains sylvia yang , the women 's division 's deputy chairperson .
" but on the mainland , a boss has to supervise everything : customs , tax payments , workers ' disputes , meal preparation . . . . there 's always the feeling that everyone will start to slack off once the boss leaves . "
all the job - related pressures and evenings out with fellow taiwanese business people or communist party cadres result in ill health for many taiwan business people on the mainland . one of chen 's tasks as chairperson of tbad is to handle funeral arrangements for taiwanese business people there . " many of them die suddenly , " he says . the association has been trying to promote healthier lifestyles .
" instead of just going out to karaoke bars and drinking , why not play golf too , " recommends h.d. yeh . dongguan has four or five golf courses within city limits . about 1,000 people play every day , and 80 - 90 % of them are taiwanese .
the taiwanese entrepreneurial spirit has blossomed here by processing goods for export through hong kong in addition to making the most of connections between local taiwan firms .
with 3,000 taiwan - owned businesses here , and 10 - 20,000 taiwanese business people and their dependants coming in and out every day , the dong - guan area has already developed an economic circle in which taiwan firms can conduct most of their business among themselves .
in the vibrant district of houjian , there is an area that locals call taiwan town .
a casual look around reveals shop signs familiar to any taiwanese : taichung goose , ah - shui shih 's pig knuckle kingdom , yungho soy milk , the mantu hair salon . . . . and most of the customers are taiwanese .
restaurants serve up authentic taiwanese fare like " pineapples and bitter melon chicken " and " sesame oil chicken . " in november 1998 global express , a taiwan firm , even opened up a shuttle bus to hong kong 's airport .
global express serves as a good example of taiwanese corporate agility .
originally , arrivals from taiwan en route to dongguan had to board buses run by a hong kong - based and mainland - financed travel agency . " but we felt that the service left something to be desired , and that a lot of time would always be wasted while holders of ' taiwanese compatriot visas ' cleared customs , " notes david chang , global travel holding 's executive director .
two years ago , this taiwanese travel agency began to talk with the mainland customs and border inspection agencies and negotiated a deal to get the route . " we tell taiwanese business people that riding our buses is safe , the service is good , and that it makes the trip through customs easy . " in enemy territory
as soon as you 're through customs at hong kong , you see them : women draped with beauty pageant - like sashes with the chinese characters for " global travel " emblazoned across them . pushing small luggage carts , they lead customers to the buses . they have become a " must - see " tourist sight for taiwanese visitors to dongguan .
" at first we thought of talking with hong kong airport about renting a counter , " explains chang . " but for just one - fourth of a six square - meter booth , the rent comes to hk$ 200,000 . " so the company thought that instead of spending that much money on a booth it made more sense to lower operating costs and pass these along in the form of lower fares for its customers . they never expected that the luggage carts would in fact make it much easier for customers to find them in sprawling hong kong airport and would become an easily recognizable company trademark .
" now mainland chinese travel agencies have started copying the way we use the carts , " says chang , laughing .
since global buses started plying this route in november 1988 , daily bus departures have risen from 4 to 27 , with over 20,000 riders a month . global plans to introduce new services , including car rentals and plane ticket reservations and confirmations . dongguan appears to have a bright future .
" the taiwan firms here now are powerful enough to get two or three members of the legislative yuan to represent their interests , " holds one senior reporter . although tbad 's yeh believes that investment prospects on the mainland are good , he does acknowledge the precariousness of their position in hostile territory .
taiwan business interests can not put down their guard . because of taiwan 's experience with rapid modernization , many ccp cadres have sought employment with taiwanese firms , hoping to learn from the masters .
at the first opportunity , however , they leave to set up shop for themselves .
" the student then challenges the master , " explains sylvia yang , detailing how these mainland upstarts go on to compete with the very taiwan firms that taught them all they know .
this scenario should be familiar to taiwanese . " it happens in taiwan too . " apart from keeping up their guard , it is even more important that taiwan firms raise their productivity and technological level . " many manufacturers , even those in mainland china , will not survive , " says yeh .
taiwan firms find it difficult to adjust to the instability of the mainland 's investment environment , as well as the laws there that seemingly change overnight .
the year before last the mainland announced a new tax system , under which raw materials imported by foreign firms would be taxed at a rate of 17 % , with 9 % being returned to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported .
" when i went to beijing to negotiate , " recalls yeh , " i asked cadres in the foreign trade office to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry . profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % . how can manufacturers afford to pay a 17 % import tax ? "
in june of last year the prc authorities announced the " document # 35 " rules . these stipulated that companies would be given grades according to the quantity of their exports and their records of breaking customs regulations . those meriting only a b would have to offer a deposit of 40 - 50 % against the value of their raw material imports .
this terrified taiwan firms in dongguan . according to tbad 's statistics , 75 % of the taiwanese firms were given bs . the announcement caused quite a stir , but its effect on taiwanese investment is as yet unclear . in august of last year , as the mainland customs authorities took aggressive moves against smuggling , 12 taiwan business people in dongguan were detained . the charges ran the gamut from not filling out proper forms to purchasing phony export contracts and trying to pass them off to customs .
seven business people were arrested and charged with smuggling and are still in jail . " i 'm constantly thinking about them . i 'm meditating and have gone vegetarian , but i 'm still not at peace , " yeh says .
on the mainland , the highest penalty for smuggling is death . " last year the mainland sent nine customs officers to the firing squad , " notes yeh .
the fate of these taiwanese businessmen will depend entirely on the mainland 's political climate . whether its arrival was by accident or design , a new age for taiwanese firms in dongguan is here . it is a far cry from the days when taiwan firms enjoyed tremendous advantages . from the various revisions to trade law adopted by the prc last year , chang han - wen extrapolates that the prc both wants to protect its uncompetitive state firms and turn from low - tech processing to high - tech production . " this is because state enterprises pressure the government with appeals about their right to survival , " yeh says .
when foreign firms in the mainland are confronted with threats to their safety and property , " hong kong can count on the cooperation of the government , us and japanese businesses can turn to their ambassadors , but what can taiwan firms do ? " asks yeh .
in dongguan they can help each other .
currently , more than 80 % of the 3,000 taiwanese firms in dongguan have joined tbad . tbad has 29 local branches in dongguan and is , moreover , the only taiwan business association in mainland china with a women 's division .
major companies listed on the taiex , including lite - on electronics and delta electronics , are members of tbad . it is the largest and strongest of all taiwan business groups on the mainland both in terms of organization and operations .
many taiwanese believe that at a time of cross-strait tension , taiwan firms have made their own decisions to invest in the mainland and therefore should bear the risk themselves too . and by investing their money , technology and so forth on the mainland , are they not to some degree abandoning taiwan ?
tbad takes issue with this view .
h.d. yeh points out that in 1998 taiwan had an overall trade surplus of us$ 5.9 billion , and a surplus of us$ 12.76 billion with mainland china . if not for its trade with the prc , therefore , taiwan would have had a trade deficit .
" we make our money here , but we pay taxes in taiwan , and most of our families and children do most of their consumer spending in taiwan , " insists tbad chairperson chang mei - liang .
chang notes that after the major earthquake in taiwan on september 21 , taiwan business associations throughout mainland china contributed nt$ 60 million .
tbad contributed nt$ 30 million all by itself . hence , he argues that it 's very unfair to say that taiwanese businesses in the mainland are n't contributing to taiwan . the question is , how should the roc government view taiwan firms in the mainland ?
and for that matter how is the prc government looking at the taiwanese in dongguan ?
tbad 's spiritual leader h.d. yeh often goes to beijing to represent taiwan firms in negotiations with the government . once , in the presence of many communist party cadres , a high - ranking official of the state council 's taiwan affairs office asked him this question : " you 've gathered so many taiwan firms in dongguan and stirred up such enthusiasm among them - but for what purpose ? " it threw him for a loop . yeh is still trying to figure out what the mainland authorities think of tbad .
for taiwan firms in dongguan , investing in mainland china is a road of no return .
" in recent years many taiwan business people have also tried to invest in vietnam , only later to close their factories there , " says chang han - wen . mainland china shares the same language as taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions .
it would be surprising if it did n't attract taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore . amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that taiwan firms in dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .

still out on the journalistic front lines at 81 , this spry , forthright veteran has an immense zest for life .
at 78 , drawing on his astonishingly sharp memory , he completed his reminiscences and " record of emotional regrets . " he is not only one of the " wonders " of taiwan 's journalistic world , but is also recognized by those of his generation as a gentleman and a " good - looking man . " a person 's looks change with their age and their state of mind .
many friends have told me i look better the older i get .
people do n't know that when i was young i had dreadful protruding teeth , but now not only do my teeth no longer show , but the lines of my face have also softened .
people who know me know that there have always been two great loves in my life : the news , and women . now that i 'm in my 80s , looking back i think i can say i 've done alright in both respects , and i 've learnt that both reporting the news well , and finding favor with women , depend on your character and conduct .
journalism is not just a profession , but should also be a vocation - you have to throw yourself fully into this infinitely broad field of endeavor . intellectually and spiritually , in work and in love , i have gained experience and fulfilment .
i have always remembered the encouragement which mr. yu youren gave me as a young reporter . he said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . you have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful .
a president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .
funnily enough , an unassuming attitude is also advantageous in relations with the opposite sex . chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role . in this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more . a considerate attitude can be expressed in little things .
for instance , when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend 's shoulder , you should lightly pick it off for her , and throw it away or put it in your pocket .
if sincere , this kind of action is attractive in a man . if a woman expresses her liking for you , then no matter whether she is pretty , or whether you find her attractive , you should respond in the same way , and with the same respect .
when i was a young reporter stationed in europe , there was a british woman reporter who liked me very much . once i was driving her somewhere to report a story when we had an accident , and she suffered some badly broken bones .
although i was n't attracted to her in that way , i went to see her every day in hospital , and this left a deep impression on her of how considerate chinese men can be .
looking back at my life , i 've hardly had any really bad experiences in my relationships with women , and this is because just as in my professional life , i 've always maintained a self - critical attitude towards my emotions , and always tried to prevent myself acting like a male chauvinist . looks are something you are born with , but character is something you can work on , and it can outweigh your appearance . luo jialun , one of the leading lights of the may fourth movement , is a famous example .
luo was not good looking , and was even ridiculed as " looking like a cross between a pig , a dog and a bear . " but he was tremendously well - read , had a beautiful writing style , and for a time he was chinese ambassador to india . his wife was a universally admired beauty , the envy of all . so i say , " handsome is as handsome does . "
i was imprisoned by both the kuomintang and the communists , and at times i might have been killed . perhaps other people in the same situation might have wallowed in self - pity , but i saw it as a rare opportunity in life . in 1951 , in a dark prison cell during a big communist purge , what came into my mind was not fear of death . instead , i wondered what kind of headline my death would merit in the newspapers . " 10,000 rush to see lu executed " ? perhaps it was this eternal optimism which changed my frame of mind and my appearance .
this is the advice i 'd like to give young people : it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look . but do n't overdo it .
it is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .
powerful tools for biotechnology - biochips -lrb- chang chiung - fang / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by robert taylor -rrb- the enterovirus detection biochip developed by dr. chip biotechnology takes only six hours to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains enterovirus , and if it is the deadly strain entero 71 .
worldwide , biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage .
in taiwan , in recent years the ministry of economic affairs , the national science council and the national health research institutes have been strongly pursuing " biochip " research programs . in the last two years , three biochip companies have also been set up in taiwan .
just what are biochips ?
what use are they to mankind ?
why do so many people have such confidence in their future ?
what is the current state of this field in taiwan ?
and what are the prospects for future development ?
let 's take a closer look .
in just a few years ' time , or a few decades , the following scenario could become a reality :
when you 're feeling under the weather , all you need to do is buy a diagnostic biochip from the chemist 's shop , put a drop of urine onto it , and you will find out what is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today .
everyone will carry with them a biochip bearing a record and analysis of their own dna . from it one will not only be able to see one 's own physical condition , but even to predict what diseases one will have in the future .
it will be like an id card , needed when looking for work , buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage .
laboratories will no longer need all kinds of large instruments , for all stages of their experiments will be carried out on little biochips , saving time , effort and money .
today , the scenes outlined above may just seem like pipe dreams . but these dreams could yet come true , and the key to that happening is those little biochips .
a dream come true ?
developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics , biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering , which have emerged as the rising stars of 21st - century industry .
as part of the government 's efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in taiwan , in july 1999 the industrial technology research institute -lrb- itri -rrb- set up the biomedical engineering center -lrb- bmec -rrb- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies .
biochips are one of the core technologies in the field . bmec general director dr. johnsee lee says that the itri 's four - year r&d program in biochip applications and technology is now in its second year . its initial objectives are mainly focused on developing sensor chips to screen for infectious diseases , while later goals will be to develop technologies to test for genetic diseases and cancers .
as well as this new research establishment , in the two years since september 1998 three commercial companies have been set up in taiwan to make biochips : u - vision biotech , taiwan genome sciences and dr. chip biotechnology .
of these , dr. chip attracted much attention this year when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses , a deadly epidemic of which has gripped taiwan over the last two years .
fever chips
dr. chip bio-technology was set up in september 1998 . vice president wang shin - hwan states that the company successfully applied to the ministry of economic affairs for funding to help it pursue a development program for enterovirus detection chips and test technology . today , the enterovirus chip is in the testing phase , and dr. chip is collaborating with taipei veterans general hospital to obtain samples with which to establish the accuracy of the chip .
what is so remarkable about the enterovirus detection chip when compared with traditional test methods ?
there are 68 known forms of non-polio enterovirus . the detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly entero 71 virus , or coxsackie a16 , which is easily confused with entero 71 .
in addition , the chip and its accompanying pcr kit greatly reduce the time required for testing .
wang shin - hwan notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days to prepare , and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes three days to get a result . but dr. chip has developed methods to reduce the sample preparation time , which enables a result to be obtained in only six hours when used in combination with their enterovirus chip .
furthermore , the initial results of joint trials by dr. chip , chang gung university and national cheng kung university suggest that the chip is over a thousand times more sensitive than traditional test methods .
" in addition to enterovirus , we plan to develop chips to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis b , hepatitis c and hiv , " says wang shin - hwan .
apart from the enterovirus chip , which is already at the testing stage , the itri 's molecular biomedical technology division is also conducting research and development on biochip applications and technology .
research program director pan chao - chi states that at present they are actively developing a " fever chip " with a wide range of applications . pan explains that in clinical practice , the causes of fever are difficult to quickly diagnose . a " fever chip " bearing the dna of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved would be a valuable tool .
however , pan points out that because of the difficulties in substantially reducing the time needed for sample preparation , the usefulness of such a fever chip is still limited , so that it can not yet be widely promoted .
where the real money is
at present , most applications for biochips are in academic research and the development of new pharmaceutical drugs .
demand for them is growing rapidly . johnsee lee says that according to us market research estimates , the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around 250,000 ; in two years this is expected to grow to 1.2 million . based on a market price per chip of us$ 1,000 , the size of the world market in biochips could grow to us$ 1.2 billion in 2003 , and to us$ 40 billion over the next decade .
thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market , and believe that following taiwan 's success in the semiconductor field , the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips .
be that as it may , the small number of biochip companies so far established in taiwan still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers . although they are also actively developing overseas markets , what interests them most is not biochips per se , nor are they content merely to be contract manufacturers . " the chips are only a tool , and the big money is not in chip sales . what counts is the r&d behind them . "
jerry huang , executive vice president of u - vision biotech , reveals that u - vision , which was set up in september 1999 , has signed a contract with the us company zen - bio to jointly develop human adipocyte cdna microarray chips .
huang states that research in recent years has revealed that adipocytes -lrb- fat cells -rrb- are active regulators of the energy balance in the body , and play an important role in disorders such as obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease .
thus it is hoped that research into human adipocytes can help in the search for drugs and other therapies to treat these disorders .
apart from this , u - vision is also conducting a one - year bacterial genome project , which aims to map the genome of a certain drug - resistant bacterium as a basis for developing new vaccines and drugs .
drug development
taiwan genome sciences -lrb- tgs -rrb- , which was set up in november 1999 as a joint venture by the uni-president enterprises group , yuen foong yu and tuntex groups , only entered the biotechnology fray in april of this year .
ceo andrew kuo says the investors came to the view that taiwan needs to develop its biotechnology industries , and therefore they combined their resources to make a long - term investment in the field .
tgs 's strategy is to invest in a number of us genome research companies , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them .
kuo comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for the company - tgs 's ultimate goal is in doing r&d work to identify gene sequences as targets for developing new drugs .
kuo states that at present , the number of known target sequences for disease - treating drugs is only around 500 , but as the human genome is mapped out this number can be expected to increase tenfold .
currently , tgs has its sights set mainly on doing research into diseases which are especially prevalent in asia , such as liver and stomach cancers .
a chip revolution
however , the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined above .
dr. johnsee lee , who as well as heading up the biomedical engineering center is also general director of union chemical laboratories , a research institute under the itri umbrella , says that due to biochips ' advantages of miniaturization , parallelism , speed and the ability to reveal the " big picture , " they have a very wide range of applications .
they can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .
biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or " lab - on - a - chip , " and the microarray chip or " dna chip . "
microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form .
meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots . bmec researcher pan chao - chi uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips .
to test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the " hybridization " reaction takes place .
finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system . hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .
in contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result .
at present , microfluidics technology is not yet mature , and no such chips have been launched as commercial products anywhere . but , says pan chao - chih : " this is the way future biochip development will go . " the poor man 's chip
future prospects also seem infinite for microarray chips , which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments .
jerry huang notes that dna chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology . on one little biochip , tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes .
in other words , whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually , today , using biochips , they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once .
in particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip .
thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane .
dr. konan peck , an assistant research fellow at academia sinica 's institute of biomedical sciences -lrb- ibms -rrb- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .
with this in mind , peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called " the poor man 's biochip , " since they cost a third less than glass chips .
apart from the material itself being cheaper , the nylon chips use a visible - spectrum colorimetric system to display results , so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner , which costs 50 - 70 % less than using a special laser detector .
the nylon membrane biochips currently produced by tgs and u - vision biotech are all derived from the technology developed by konan peck .
cutting edge
can taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?
bmec director johnsee lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .
however , due to taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills . thus , says lee , " taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "
the potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .
apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .
" because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says johnsee lee .
in his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .
in other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .
at present , the bmec has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .
pushing the envelope although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives . but one day they will play an important role in all our lives .
" applications and commercialization are our goal , " says johnsee lee . he says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback . equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .
lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .
he predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .
ibms associate research fellow konan peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .
but in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .
mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun .
turning to the constitution on the " one china " issue
still wrestling with the vexed issue of " one china , " the president 's advisory group on cross-strait relations met for its sixth and seventh sessions during november , amid frenzied media attention . the group eventually reached a consensus that the " one china " principle advocated by the mainland should be addressed " in accordance with the constitution . "
how president chen shui - bian responds to this proposal will determine whether or not the " one china " stalemate can be broken , and if there is to be a set timetable for implementing the three direct links .
after assuming the presidency , chen shui - bian recruited a number of leading politicians , industrialists , academics and other personages for a non-partisan advisory group , intended to build cross-party consensus on the subject of relations with the mainland .
chaired by academia sinica president lee yuan - tseh , the presidential advisory group on cross-strait relations first met in early september .
since then the group has held a series of intensive discussions on taiwan 's fundamental position regarding the cross-strait relationship . the group entered the final phase of discussions on the " one china " issue during november , but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued to stymie the effort to produce a statement acceptable to all .
as dpp legislator shen fu - hsiung pointed out , the group had to draft something " palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which the dpp ca n't shun and yet which does n't make beijing wince . " clearly no easy task .
on the evening of november 18 advisory group chairman lee yuan - tseh , meeting over dinner with dpp faction leaders , described the cross-strait situation as extremely precarious , and said that since time is not on taiwan 's side we need to step up efforts to resume dialogue with the mainland .
separately , during his report to the legislative yuan on the academia sinica 's budget , lee reiterated : " if the whole population could arrive at a consensus on ' one china , ' then president chen would have no grounds for not accepting that consensus . "
lee added that he hoped the advisory group would shortly come to a firm conclusion on the " one china " issue . lee yuan - tseh 's appeal made little impression on the governing dpp , however . furthermore , dpp chairman frank hsieh himself came under fire within the party after stating : " the constitution of the roc is itself a one china framework .
since the dpp has participated in the process of constitutional amendment it ought to accept this constitution , and as the party of government we ca n't afford to override or reject it . " according to dpp lawmaker lin cho - shui , chen shui - bian has shown more goodwill to beijing as president than lee teng - hui ever did , but without any response - so why should he once again be expected to respond on the " one china " issue ?
also , lin disagrees with lee yuan - tseh 's assertion that " time is not on our side , " and instead feels that things are no worse than before .
meanwhile , the opposition alliance has been calling for the dpp to " shed its ideological baggage . "
on november 24 the new party , which had already pulled out of the advisory group , published an article in the press signed by leading members such as yu mu - ming and chen kui - miao , in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the " one china " deadlock .
they pointed out that chen and the dpp had competed in elections in accordance with the constitution , winning the presidency and a share of seats in the legislature and the national assembly , and had also participated in the process of revising the constitution .
now , with its constitutionally granted mandate , the party has an obligation to fully uphold the constitution . as the politicians argued , formosa plastics boss wang yung - ching convened a meeting with other captains of industry to come up with some advice for the government on economic policy .
for the first time wang voiced support for lee yuan - tseh 's proposal that " with ' one china ' as the precondition , each side can have its own interpretation . "
wang also agreed with lee 's notion that time is running out for taiwan , in the belief that taiwan will only have time on its side once it starts to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland .
consensus on the " one china question " is an urgent priority for both sides if there is to be a peaceful future .
wang yung - ching 's demand for a review of the government 's " go slow " policy , and opening of the three direct links , brought a personal phone call from the president , who invited him to come and discuss policy . on november 25 wang and a handful of other leading industrialists went to call on the president at his official residence . the businessmen said that shelving the " one china " issue was not the right thing for the government to do , and that taiwan could no longer afford to play word games .
they stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue , and said that the government should also think about moving towards political dialogue . the presidential advisory group met again on november 26 , and discussed a proposal , made earlier by public television system chairman wu feng - shan and already favored by most members of the group , for " one china " to be addressed through " three acknowledgements and four suggestions . "
a firm consensus was finally arrived at , and the group submitted to the president its proposal that taiwan should " respond to the mainland 's ' one china ' proposition in accordance with the constitution of the roc . "
the government and opposition parties continued to disagree regarding this consensus .
dpp legislator lin cho - shui described it as " acceptable , if not very satisfactory . " pfp spokesman li ching - an called it " a conclusion without a conclusion . "
new party convenor hau lung - pin said the statement was too ambiguous , tending towards " one china , with each side free to make its own interpretation , " and added that it was highly unlikely to be used by the president as a guide for cross-strait policy .
ting shou - chung , deputy executive director of the kmt policy committee , said this so - called consensus was simply a case of going round and round on the spot , and would do nothing to solve the core problem .
in a november 28 press release , the mainland affairs council -lrb- mac -rrb- , the government body in charge of cross-strait affairs , diplomatically stated that it would observe and implement the suggestions of the advisory group if and when they become official government policy . speaking on the topic of the three direct links , mac chairwoman tsai ing - wen said that these will be phased in according to conditions , with the first phase being the opening of direct business links as necessitated by the admission of both sides to the wto .
and according to economics minister lin hsin - yi , the government recognizes that the " go slow " policy needs to be relaxed , and will give a more thorough accounting of this before the end of the year .
tanshui : an inspiration to poets , artists , and romantics
-lrb- lin i - hsien / photos by diago chiu / tr. by phil newell -rrb- in paintings , a white cloud layer swirls over mt. kuanyin ;
waves on the river drift like a breeze ; a red sun dances on golden water ; a yellow moon sings from a deep purple sky . . . . the tanshui of illustrations is a place of unblemished beauty , a myth that remains unshakeable .
in the 300 - plus years since its founding , this port town - formerly called huwei , now tanshui township - has seen days of prosperity and has also been through a baptism of fire . what makes it special among the 309 urban and rural townships of taiwan ?
how do the people of tanshui live today ? how do they recall the past ? and how do they see the future ?
" you want to know how tanshui has changed ? i would say that the biggest change is that the old streets are gone . " so declares tu hsiu - yuan , proprietor of the hui yuan pharmacy , and also director of the huwei cultural and historical workshop .
his pharmacy is located on what is now called chungcheng road , one of the oldest streets , which tanshui natives still call huwei street .
tu , who has lived his whole life in the old neighborhood , has watched from his doorstep as old shops have refurbished themselves in modern style , and modern shops have adopted the look of the old .
for the convenience of cars , the streets have been widened repeatedly .
in 1988 , the last train on the old tanshui line of the railroad chugged into history , taking that old slower pace of life with it . in 1997 the tanshui line of the mass rapid transit system opened , bringing floods of visitors to the town . yet , while these tourists bring a human touch to the streets on weekends and holidays , on ordinary weekdays the silence is accompanied only by leftover garbage , empty shops , and those huwei people who refuse to leave their old homes .
the golden age of huwei there are different explanations as to the origins of the word huwei , the original name for tanshui . some say it was a transliteration of the place name used by the indigenous people .
but others say it comes from a long - gone fishing practice , using a shi hu -lrb- " stone pool " -rrb- .
early fishermen used stones to carve a long , narrow catchment -lrb- the so - called " pool " -rrb- in the sand , waiting for the tide to carry in fish which they could then easily scoop up . since the place now known as tanshui was at the tail end -lrb- wei -rrb- of this stone pool , it came to be called huwei . tanshui occupied an important place in the transport network connecting taiwan to southeast asia .
even before the arrival of westerners in taiwan , han chinese often crossed over from china to tanshui , which is relatively close to the mainland . here they engaged in barter trade with the pingpu -lrb- meaning " plains " -rrb- aborigines , with deer skins and sulphur being the most coveted products . as western powers turned their eyes to asia , tanshui became strategically important .
in the 17th century , first the spanish , and then the dutch , built forts here as symbols of their claims to territorial control . in the mid-17th century , china took control of taiwan , and closed tanshui to international trade .
later , as a result of the sino - french war of 1884 , tanshui was again opened up to western access .
during tanshui 's golden age , large and small boats were constantly coming and going in the harbor , and it was not unusual to see enormous steamships .
in the latter part of the qing dynasty , tanshui was the largest port in taiwan , and was the " customs headquarters , " also charged with overseeing port activities at keelung , tainan , and kaohsiung .
however , during the japanese occupation , as a result of silting , and because the japanese invested a huge effort in developing the port at keelung , tanshui faded in importance , never again to see the likes of its glory days .
tanshui is a place of many historic sites , a place that invites reflection on things past .
in the " foreign district , " a missionary named george mackay established the first hospital for western medicine in taiwan ; it was here that in 1878 the first case of paragonimiasis in the world was diagnosed . the old church next to the hospital is a mecca for tanshui painters . the schools , homes , and consulates in the foreign district - some long gone , some still standing - testify to the fact that this was a place of intensive interaction between chinese and western cultures .
if you go up sanmin street , you will discover the head of an old and disused water pipe .
this could be a relic left behind by one of the major japanese infrastructure projects , the first tap water station . or you could walk instead next to the mrt station and see another first for taiwan : the first seaplane landing area , also built in the japanese occupation era .
or you could visit the venerable tamkang secondary school . as you watch the children laughing and arguing and playing , you can think back to the time when the japanese government did not allow taiwanese and japanese to attend school together .
under those circumstances , tamkang middle school became a cradle for the training of taiwanese elites . gradually you will discover that tanshui is a bookish place .
this little town has everything from nursery schools to graduate schools . during the reign of the guangxu emperor of the qing dynasty -lrb- which began in 1875 -rrb- , and prior to the beginning of the japanese occupation in 1895 , tanshui produced two successful candidates in the highest level military exam , one in the highest level civil exam , and countless successes in lower - level imperial exams .
even in modern times , the town has not passed up chances to embrace knowledge : when the idea of founding tam - kang university in tanshui was going to be abandoned because of a lack of land and money , local residents offered cheap land , donated money , and lobbied so that the university could set its roots in town .
these historic sites are near the river , but do n't spend all your time there . do n't forget the tatun mountains , which shelter the town .
in the old days , tanshui folk who cultivated farms on the slopes had to walk for an hour to get to their crops . these days you can take a local mini-bus . in the mountains you will see the occasional terraced field grown over with weeds .
this land , which has gone from grass to grain and back to grass again , is where many an old tanshui native played when they were children .
the tanshui mystique the mountains are also filled with old stories . the often - renovated hsing chung tang shop is more than a century old . owner li yung - kun is a descendant of the eminent li family of tanshui , which produced three juren -lrb- a successful candidate in provincial - level exams , held every three years -rrb- .
the house testifies to this past : it has a swallow - tailed roof and a flagpole , features that only the home of a juren was entitled to have .
li mingbin -lrb- whose name by birth is li minghui -rrb- , a scholar from beijing university currently working at chinese culture university on an exchange program , is a descendant of the juren li yingzhen , who was wounded resisting the japanese occupation and fled to the mainland , where he settled down .
like his elders , li mingbin bridges the gap across the taiwan strait , as he is capable of conversing fluently in either beijing dialect or the southern fujian dialect used in taiwan .
of course , stories do n't have to be old to be interesting .
today 's tanshui residents are living their own stories .
the crotchety but modest guy who delivers the newspapers , the seafood restaurant owner who has made his fortune from scratch , the old man at the roadside food stall , the hostess in the tea house greeting and sending off guests . . . . some are active in the early morning , some late at night . though the founders of many of these shops have passed away , the second generation has taken the baton .
in the old bamboo tea shop , the now elderly hostess still plays her role amidst the ambience of wine and tea , offering a feminine presence to help put at ease her customers who come looking for a little relaxation , evoking the bewitching atmosphere of tanshui at night .
businessmen from outside , smelling profits , have set up gaudy storefronts and neon signs , hoping to trade on tanshui 's mystique to sell coffee , seafood , antiques , and snack foods .
students , who have enough money to keep several streets of shops going , carelessly wheel their motorcycles through the narrow streets , their minds elsewhere , thinking of youthful fun or romance .
happy couples and jilted lovers line the river , displaying their joy or sadness in their postures : two people 's shadows are melted together by the darkened river behind , while others stand alone on the riverbank like statues .
the weeping river
have you heard of the weeping junks ? during the sino - french war , taiwan governor liu mingchuan , attempting to obstruct a french landing , scuttled several of these boats .
it is said that , late at night , the sunken junks make moaning sounds . but i think that it may be the river itself that is moaning .
in 1998 , the government produced a plan for a riverside expressway to tanshui .
the road , which was expected to have three levels , would have cut through rare mangroves and created a barrier between the river and the town of tanshui .
if the plan had been implemented , people who wanted to go to tanshui and gaze out over the river would have had to find some very high vantage point in town to do so !
fortunately , thanks to efforts by cultural and environmental activists from tanshui , the plan was first postponed , and then was ultimately killed after an environmental impact assessment released in september refused to approve the scheme . but a question remains : is something like this bound to come sooner or later ?
" for the purposes of development , the tanshui coast has been constantly exploited . but what will be result of this incessant struggle against nature ? " says an agitated tu hsiu - yuan . and hsieh teh - hsi of the tamsui culture foundation adds : " high - rises are going up one after another in tanshui new town [ a huge government - planned development ] , but many of the apartments remain empty .
everybody here knows that when the northeast winds blow in during the winter , that is the coldest place around . no wonder those apartments are not selling ! " tu says , with disbelief and exasperation in his voice : " do you know that they are going to build a huge bridge between tanshui and pali ? it 's such a beautiful and historic location , but they are just going to stick up a bridge there , and they are even talking about having a rotating restaurant on top ! "
lovers of tanshui , while keeping close watch over her , are fearful that the giant beast of development may eventually come and bulldoze tanshui away one piece of land at a time . they fear that their children , like they themselves , will have to search through photographs and memories to find tanshui 's traditional simplicity and the joys of being close to nature .
when the old buildings are gone , and people lose contact with the great outdoors , will tanshui even be worthy of its reputation anymore ? scattered wooden fishing boats bob in the river . i have n't met any of the fishermen who these days go out and catch only small fry .
they might relate how in the old days they could just put a hand in the river and come up with a big catch . the lonely fishing boats are waiting for the tanshui - pali ferry to pass by and say hello .
those lanterns moving through the river are actually the ferry , while those stars flashing in the distance are beams of light that come from the lighthouse every five seconds .
it is only now that i realize that , even in the drabbest weather , tanshui is still beautiful .

the remaking of linpien home of the black pearl wax apple
-lrb- teng sue - feng / photos by jimmy lin / tr. by christopher macdonald -rrb-
even if the township of linpien does n't have a monopoly on the cultivation of " black pearl " wax apples , it was orchards in the linpien locality that earned black pearls their national renown . a little town formerly notorious for its ground subsidence problem , linpien is now turning itself into one of southern taiwan 's premier tourist attractions . the impetus for this change has come chiefly from local historians , along with various voluntary groups .
just before christmas break , the rural township of linpien , on the pingtung plain at the mouth of the linpien river , held its first ever wax apple festival . the festival , in the town 's riverside park , was held to promote black pearl wax apples and celebrate the local volunteer spirit .
it was a scorching hot day , and heavily perspiring visitors were to be seen wandering among the stalls , lugging bags of wax apples and commenting on their remarkable sweetness .
" there 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , " says local farmer chen sheng - tzung . " how you take care of the orchards , which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit . " prices for wax apples range widely , from around 3 pounds for nt$ 100 to nt$ 150 a pound . fruit that shows a hint of black through the red color of the skin fetches the best price .
huang wan - fu , whose family farms two hectares of orchard with more than 700 wax apple trees , and who has over 30 years ' experience as a fruit grower , says that while other parts of pingtung county also grow wax apples , " linpien stands out for its growing techniques , developed through trial and error by the growers themselves , and for vernalization rates of up to 90 % . "
ugly duckling no more
the wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the malay peninsula . the dutch brought it to taiwan from java , in the 17th century , and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree .
old folk in the south remember when wax apples were " just something to munch on " - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to .
but wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown .
for example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin . the method soon caught on throughout the district .
another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields . this reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit . the net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit . as a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year .
the " black pearl " tag did n't originate in linpien , but it was linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market .
in 1983 the then - provincial governor lee teng - hui visited the town and praised the quality of its black pearl wax apples , so assuring the renown of the fruit .
subsequently , as president , lee teng - hui often gave gifts of black pearl wax apples to foreign dignitaries .
green hills
the success of black pearl wax apples gave linpien a much - needed boost , bringing some of the younger generation back to the area to grow the fruit . the credit for putting wax apples at the heart of the town 's revival and for mounting the wax apple festival belongs with a group of volunteer workers - local people committed to the town 's regeneration .
how does a small town like linpien come to be home to such a well - organized volunteer effort , and just how did the volunteers set about giving their town a make - over ? the story begins with the town 's riverside park .
the road linking the town 's main street with the riverside park , where locals like to stroll and chat at the beginning and end of the day , used to be overgrown and lined with trash .
now , however , thanks to a coordinated effort involving volunteers , residents and landlords , the verges are planted with sunflowers and lantana , while a former mud patch , donated rent - free by its owner , has been converted into a carp - filled lotus pool .
the revamping of linpien started eight or nine years ago , when schoolteacher tsao chi - hung - now a dpp deputy in the national legislature - along with fellow members of the linpien residents ' democracy association launched a program to sweep the streets and keep the riverbank clean . wu wu - ta , a plumber who runs the democracy association , says : " people were already doing their bit for the community over ten years ago , but not openly . they swept the streets before dawn because they did n't want people to see them and call them crazy . "
it was only three years ago , with the founding of the non-political linpien natural history conservation association , that residents began to publicly support the project .
the flood - prone linpien river has been dyked and dredged since the japanese colonial era , but the bare concrete embankments never did much for the scenery . in 1999 tsao chi - hung learned that the water conservancy bureau was planning to renovate the flood defenses , and he proposed a scheme for " greenification " of the riverside area .
objections were raised , however , with some pointing out that the site , if left untended , could easily get overgrown and become a breeding ground for snakes and vermin .
the issue was discussed and finally the bureau agreed to let volunteers maintain the riverside area for two years . if the scheme did n't work out then the bureau would concrete over the site as originally planned . following the lead of the conservation association and the democracy association , various volunteer groups in the district - including the senior citizens ' club , members of tzu chi buddhist foundation , the presbyterian church , and followers of the i - kuan tao sect - signed up to share responsibility for the riverside park , which was divided into 90 - meter - long plots for the purpose .
turf was laid , flower beds appeared , and the embankment soon became a 1.2 km - long " green great wall . " dreaming by the river " you ca n't go about community work in a standoffish way , and you certainly ca n't operate effectively from behind the scenes - you have to be out there at the front of things . when local people see teachers and doctors coming out to collect trash , they feel encouraged to join in , " says chen chin - chao , a dentist who chairs the linpien natural history conservation association .
chen frets about the way the media has focused the spotlight on him alone , when numerous other individuals are also involved , all chipping in what they can . " the biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says tsao chi - hung . " as more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . "
the riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the east , the sunset in the west , and the dreamy river alongside the park . " the more that people get involved the greater their sense of accomplishment , " says tsao . " it 's not just about tidying up the environment .
we also hope to foster the commercial interests of the community so as to bring practical benefits for people 's lives . " this was the thinking behind tsao 's gathering together of various groups for the wax apple festival . according to the archives , 400 years ago linpien was a plains - aborigine settlement called " fang - suo - she . "
in the middle of the 17th century the ming dynasty loyalist zheng chenggong -lrb- also known as koxinga -rrb- brought an influx of settlers to taiwan from the fujian and guangdong regions of china . some of the fang - suo - she aborigines stayed and intermarried with chinese , while others moved away . the oldest recorded use of the name " linpien " is on a stele , erected in 1762 , next to the town 's sanshan king temple .
the name , which means " beside the forest , " indicates that the early settlers must have had a tough time clearing land for their crops .
moving to center - stage in the past half century or more linpien has concentrated on a series of different forms of produce , from rice , to bananas , to prawn and eel farming , to wax apples - today 's main crop . with taiwan 's imminent accession to the wto , the next big change could be just around the corner .
for example , will wax apples lose their market to imported fruit ? and what does linpien have to offer that other districts in the county ca n't easily duplicate ?
yang hung - jen , a phd student at national taiwan university 's graduate institute of sociology , came to linpien a year ago to research his thesis on the renewal of the local community . " i had come to what was said to be the worst county in taiwan for factionalism and corruption , " says yang , " a place where the ground had sunk as much as three meters due to subsidence . but the contrast between that image and what i actually found here was quite something . "
for yang , the way that those most active in the renewal effort routinely pass the credit to others is itself impressive . linpien rose to prominence on the strength of its celebrated wax apples . but can it now push its way to center - stage as a tourist attraction ?
says chen chin - chao : " we ca n't yet say how things will turn out for linpien .
but that 's not to be pessimistic about the town 's prospects ; it 's simply a case of not building castles in the air . " development of the long - promised tapeng bay scenic area is due to begin , and in 2003 the 2nd southern freeway will open . will this bring more prosperity to the area ?
construction of a bypass around the town has already boosted property values , but what other benefits may it bring ?
a golf course is mooted , but will that mean the loss of birdwatching zones and the mangrove woods ?
can the wax apple orchards be adapted to serve as a setting for family outings ? and can fish farms in the locality be converted to provide housing and accommodation , and a recreation alternative for visitors ?
can this little town make an asset of its scenic location and historical roots to attract more visitors ? linpien used to be little more than a brief stop for travelers on their way to the seaside resort of kenting , but now its residents are wondering if they can turn the town into a destination in its own right .
linpien facts and figures linpien rural township is in pingtung county , located on the pingtung plain at the mouth of the linpien river .
it is adjacent to the planned tapeng bay scenic area , and marks the point where the 2nd southern freeway will terminate .
at 15.6 sq. km in area , it is the second smallest of pingtung county 's 33 townships , and has a population of around 23,000 .
wax apples and aquaculture products are the main commodities , with betel nut and coconut also grown . one - third of the township 's land is below sea level .
visitors are recommended to try the local seafood and also not to miss the opportunity for bird - watching among the nearby estuaries , wetlands and mangrove woods . there are also cultural relics including traces of the original plains - aborigine inhabitants .
linpien can be reached along provincial highway 17 . the town has a railway station and can also be accessed by public and private bus services .

tips for getting through middle age
-lrb- laura li / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb- middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .
many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges . a minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap . middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest .
as a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked .
middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook .
in comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy . even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes chiu chia - li , director of the hwo chyuan pastoral counseling center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases . social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems . this is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings . but by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health .
in recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .
how do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?
here are a few suggestions :
1. live well at every stage of life
li liang - che , a professor of psychology at national chengchi university , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .
he points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .
smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier . in other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life . foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .
is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?
chang der - chung , an associate professor in the department of living science at national open university who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start .
middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they 're not hard to avoid .
are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?
then no matter how busy you are , you 've got to set aside some time to be with your spouse .
are you worried about losing your job ?
then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money .
are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?
then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves .
there are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start . otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed . 2. start over in china it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . " but now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .
to assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised . hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over .
chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws .
stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history .
with each new era , role models change .
until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .
for instance , today 's middle - aged chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .
they set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large . many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers . their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves .
then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire . and there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional chinese wife and mother . ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .
3. turn the focus from outside to inside
life is a process that moves from the " outward " to the " inward , " says alice lu , director of the international family life education center , getting to the heart of the matter .
lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults , they set their sights on educational qualifications , finding a good job , making money , marrying a good spouse and so forth . everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success , and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age .
" by middle age , people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can , " says lu . " what they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it . this is the time of life when the doubts set in . " many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , " is this really what i want ? what has been the point of all my hard striving ? "
when the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives ! but then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .
" in middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , " says lu . " it 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . " people ask themselves : am i truly happy ? do i like the person i see in the mirror ?
why ? what dreams can i pursue ? at this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards . instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .
" one need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes chiu . everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves .
it 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion . everyone is unique . morris chang was in his fifties when he became an entrepreneur and founded taiwan semiconductor .
many others at the same time in life have opted to take early retirement and find a guru in india , work as a volunteer , or do whatever else they want to do .
in the modern age when people value different things , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success .
4. realistically strive for one 's dreams when focusing inward , many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface . at such times , one should remember to ask oneself three questions : " what do i want ? " " what can i do ? " and " what must i do and have ? "
chang der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs , and then think about the costs . will meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one 's responsibilities ? is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ?
when facing problems at work in taiwan , many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland china or southeast asia .
pursuing some dream of really making it big , many men use up their savings , leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land .
there 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way to guarantee a venture will be successful , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear .
" it is indeed the case that when one is young , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , " says chang by way of analogy .
" once you get into middle age , you 've got to make every arrow count . " chang explains that everyone has dreams , and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age . middle - aged people have heavy burdens , and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them . " but accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . "
if you make an effort to do what you can , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened .
chang cites this example : say you hate being tied up by your work , and would like to go back to school .
why do n't you try a weekend class ? maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety . or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization . this would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment . and you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising .
what 's more , do n't worry too much about time being short . remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages . in middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society , decide which of your problems are the most urgent .
do n't try to accomplish all of your dreams at once . maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves . 5. change your perspective in middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet .
" i am thankful for the bad times , for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself , " says lin hung - kuei , an i - kuan tao devotee , who has studied the book of changes and fengshui .
taking care of your parents , losing your job , illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life . they are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living .
" by changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , " points out chiu chia - li .
it is very important to adjust your frame of mind . you should n't think that there is only one way that you can be .
as long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right .
as for losing your job in middle age , some people make nt$ 100,000 and it 's not enough . other's find that nt$ 20,000 is more than enough to support the family .
the problem is that by insisting on making nt$ 100,000 a month , you may pass by a suitable job that pays nt$ 20,000 .
chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age , they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but they 've got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead .
" even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . "
at the very least , you 've got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction . when li liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself , he uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off . those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward , " li says .
then they 'll realize how lucky they are . " chiu chia - li , on the other hand , encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off . they must get out and make friends , so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other . this makes it easier to get through the bad times .
finally , there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day .
" whether you are depressed or going berserk , it 's important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged , " says chang .
much like rebellious adolescents , they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again . do n't give up hope too early , and do n't be afraid of asking for assistance .
when you feel at a loss emotionally , the experts will be able to help .

in 1997 , mexico 's total amount of foreign trade broke through 220 billion us dollars , which created a new historical record .
however , in reviewing mexico 's foreign trade situation this year , it might be appropriate to say that it is between joy and sorrow .
the joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum , and has realized trade surpluses for the third year in a row , whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed , and this year , a relatively large deficit may appear .
according to official journals published recently by mexico 's treasury department , mexico 's foreign trade in 1997 continued to grow rapidly , the total amount of imports and exports reached 220.178 billion us dollars , 18.85 % higher than that of the previous year , and within that the amount of exports was 110.380 billion us dollars , the amount of imports was 109.798 billion us dollars , 15 % and 22.7 % higher than 1996 , respectively .
the trade surplus was 582 million us dollars . foreign trade occupies a pivotal position in mexico 's economy .
at present , exports account for more than 30 % of its gdp , which is one of the primary economic growth forces .
after the outbreak of mexico 's financial crisis in 1994 , mexico 's currency , the peso was greatly devalued , thus greatly strengthening mexico 's export competitiveness .
in the last several years , the government has been vigorously supporting exports , and exports grew rapidly . in 1995 , the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed , and up to now , has maintained trade surpluses for three years in a row .
however , in the past three years , mexico 's foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : 7.889 billion us dollars in 1995 , 6.424 billion us dollars in 1996 , and only 582 million us dollars last year .
especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in july last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20 million us dollars in july to 722 million us dollars in december , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .
local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of last year was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which is even higher than that of exports .
in the second half of last year , the average growth rate of imports was 6 % to 7 % higher than that of exports .
among import sectors , swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods , 39.9 % and 38.2 % higher than that of 1996 respectively .
the growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by 18.8 % .
secondly , the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor .
an overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports , but hindered exports .
it is commonly known that in 1994 , before the outbreak of the financial crisis , the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18 billion us dollars . the huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that triggered this crisis .
hence , the trade situation last year has caused extreme concern among people from economic circles , who even predicted that in 1998 , foreign trade deficit would revive .
they pointed out that , this year , except for an overly high peso exchange rate , exports would also face some new unfavorable factors . for instance , asian currency devaluation will decrease export competitiveness , and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce oil revenues .
under these circumstances , if the import growth momentum can not be restrained , this year , a trade deficit of 4 to 5 billion us dollars may appear .

israel 's foreign minister , shimon peres , said that china , by persevering in going its own way , and concentrating its efforts on conquering poverty set an example for the people of every country of the middle east .
this is what peres said in the preface he composed especially for the chinese edition of his just published new work " the new middle east . "
peres said : " china and israel are at the two ends of asia , separated by ' ten thousand crags and torrents . '
yet the people of our two countries nevertheless are similar to one another .
the great chinese people offered up to the world cultural riches on the spiritual plane and material plane .
if these riches did n't exist , people would not be able to describe the course of history . "
he said in addition : " we who live in western asia are gazing at the east with a look of hope and reverence .
china has already demonstrated to the entire world that the strategy for resolving the question of poverty in society lies in carrying out a plan that has been reasoned out and in concentrating strength towards a task that has a reasonable hope of success . . . . . . .
china still believes in the path that it itself has specified .
in the past it has not yielded to any pressure from outside , and now it still unswervingly defends the right to determine its own future for itself . "
the book " the new middle east " originally was published as an english edition around the end of autumn last year .

peres pointed out that these goals are not likely to be realized easily . they require a sensible attitude and a dedicated spirit .

in the past two years , guangdong province has exerted itself to explore new ways of attracting talent under market economy conditions , and has been active in using market mechanisms to allocate resources of talent , and has achieved preliminary results .
" taking the first step " in guangdong 's reform and opening up in the 1980's was closely related to the situation at that time of the " peafowl flying towards the southeast " -lrb- human talents from all over , one after another , going to guangdong -rrb- .
with the overall opening up of china 's coastal areas , frontier areas , riverside areas and capital cities of every province since the 1990's , the flow of talent tends to be multi-directional and the competition has become increasingly fierce .
further enhancing the attraction to talented persons has become the key point of guangdong 's further development .
limo qin , director of the talent exchange and service center of guangdong province has done analysis and said : " the economic development rate of guangdong in 1993 was at an intermediate level of that in the recent years . in that year it introduced more than 100,000 talented persons of various types . developing at this rate , in the next ten years , not including graduates from higher education institutes , guangdong 's talent gap is conservatively estimated to surpass 1 million .
therefore , further opening minds and introducing talent are guidelines of guangdong 's policy regarding talented people . "
in recent years , there have been more and more climaxes in guangdong 's talent market .
each year , there are several large - scale talent employment fairs whose service for more than 1000 employers and more than 10,000 applicants lasts for more than half a month .
in the whole year of 1993 , talent exchange centers of personnel departments across the province registered more than 463,000 people applying for jobs . there were 62,000 people with documents of transfer or employment processed , of which 45.8 % had intermediate or advanced level titles of specialty or profession , and 78 % had an undergraduate or higher degree .
talent introduction departments also actively went out visiting science and technology management talent .
fourteen cities such as guangzhou , shenzhen , etc. went to beijing for the first national talent and technology exchange fair , where they established a total of 100 employment booths . at the beginning of 1993 , six cities such as zhuhai , foshan , etc. also organized a delegation to advertise in the us and canada for students studying abroad . 1006 students abroad filled out application forms , and quite a number of people have successively returned to china to take jobs .
at the same time , the construction of talent market is also accelerating .
since 1991 when shenzhen established the first standing talent market , such " all - weather " talent exchange organizations have rapidly spread in the zhujiang delta and all cities within the province . now , there are fifteen cities with relatively more advanced economies in the province having built up regular markets .
in order to further enhance the attraction of talent , to break through the barrier of " departmental ownership " of talent , and to promote the flow of talent by forming mechanisms of independent employment and job choice , guangdong province has also paid greater attention to the formulation of relevant policies and regulations .
limo qin said in his introduction that in recent years the provincial government has successively issued documents such as " temporary regulations on encouraging persons studying abroad to work in guangdong " , " notices on better advertising for talent " , etc . it will soon promulgate documents such as " detailed rules for implementing temporary regulations on resignations of specialists , technicians and managers in state - owned units " and " supplementary regulations of guangdong province on the management of chinese side cadres in foreign investment enterprises " , etc .
additionally , some new methods in inviting and managing talent have been being tried in various regions .

at the press conference held this afternoon , guofang shen , spokesman of the foreign ministry , answered reporters ' questions such as the issue of hong kong and concerning the " 1995 financial year overseas activities fund appropriation act " of the us , etc .
a reporter asked : the standing committee of the national people 's congress had passed a resolution regarding " the three - tiered administrative system of hong kong will operate until june 30th , 1997 , and then cease . " ;
then , what will the three - level chinese restructured administrative system be like ?
and when does the chinese side plan to set about preparing to construct this system ?
guofang shen said that the hk - uk three - level administrative system , namely the last hk - uk legislative council , the two municipal departments , and the district parliament will only exist till june 30th , 1997 . this is the inevitable outcome of the uk terminating its rule over hong kong at the designated time .
he said that the chinese government has repeatedly stated that the hong kong special administrative region 's first legislative assembly and regional organizations will be formed according to the basic law and relevant resolutions of the national people 's congress .
currently , the preparatory work committee of the preparatory committee of the hong kong special administrative region is studying relevant specific issues on forming the hong kong special administrative region 's first legislative assembly , and will submit suggestions to the preparatory committee that will be established in 1996 .
a reporter asked : on august 23rd , the us president signed the " 1995 financial year overseas activities fund appropriation act " in which it is stipulated that any donation made by the us to the un population fund must not be used in china . what is your opinion of this ?
guofang shen said that this bill is a bill carrying political discrimination and extremely unfriendly to china . it is an insult to china 's family planning policy , has seriously violated the mission and principles of the un charter , and sets a very bad precedent for the provision of aid to multi-lateral organizations of the un .
he pointed out that " we resolutely oppose any country providing donations with attached conditions to the population fund .
we do not hope to see the work of the un population fund receiving interference or even being diverted from its principles and mission due to pressure from the us . "

the china 's handicapped sports cause has undergone the several stages of conceptualization , growth and expansion , and is currently rising .
the holding of the 6th far east and south pacific disabled games will provide more impetus for this trend .
each development step of handicapped sports can not be separated from the concern and support of the party and the government .
at the beginning of the establishment of the people 's republic of china , social welfare services and schools for blind children and deaf people were established successively everywhere .
welfare factories developed activities such as broadcast exercises , etc. and schools established physical education .
as a part of the cause for the disabled , disabled sports began to grow .
every year , the nation allocates special funds to be used in developing handicapped sports activities .
nationwide handicapped sports games began to be held in the late 1950's .
the games accelerated improvement and drove popularization .
the handicapped sports cause has gradually grown .
since the reform and opening up , the chinese economy has developed rapidly . this enabled more people to put money and material resource into the disabled sports cause .
in the short 10 years , the cause has achieved success of attention from china and abroad .
it is reasonable to believe that the disabled cause will be increasingly recognized and supported as china 's overall national strength escalates .
the handicapped sports cause will also have broad development .
the establishment and healthiness of disabled sports organizations provide organizational assurance for the development of the sports cause for handicapped people .
the chinese injured and disabled people sports association -lrb- renamed to the chinese disabled sports association in 1990 -rrb- was established in october , 1983 .
after this a succession of handicapped sports organizations were established throughout china .
in 1985 , the chinese mentally impaired and blind sports associations were also established .
having organization and leadership , activities such as the games and competitions , etc. were increasingly and frequently held . the enthusiasm of handicapped people participating in the sports activities was unprecedentedly increasing , sports levels continually improve and the reserve force is growing .
three national disabled games were held respectively in hefei , tangshan and guangzhou . the scale became larger and larger and the level became higher and higher . the games have received more broad attention and support of the public , and have attracted more disabled people to take part in the events .
since 1984 the chinese disabled sports association has become a member of 8 international disabled sports organizations successively , such as the international para olympic committee , etc. and has established relations with disabled sports organizations in various countries and areas and taken part in international events such as the special olympic games , etc .
in competitions and contacts , disabled chinese people have revealed extraordinary physical abilities , achieved excellent results , enhanced friendship with disabled people from various countries and areas and contributed to the development of physical activities for disabled people around the world .
" the guaranteed law for disabled persons in the people 's republic of china " , which was drafted and implemented in 1991 , stipulates to organize and support disabled people to develop mass sports activities , to hold special games and to participate in important international competitions and communication .
the guarantee of the law has and will continue to boost the vigorous development of the sports cause for china 's disabled .
holding the 6th asia - pacific special olympic games in beijing will motivate all of society to better understand and support disabled sports . it will make the public more conscious of helping disabled people and encourage more disabled people to take part in physical activities . it will , therefore , greatly assist in the development of the sports cause for china 's disabled .
truly , the foundation of disabled sports in china is not very strong , popularization is not yet widespread , and compared with some developed countries , still has a large gap .
however , the " impact " of the far south games foreshadows a bright future for this civilized and progressive cause .
-lrb- end -rrb-
in the script " mongolian handicapped athletes prepare for the far south sports meet " broadcast today , the " sports association chairman lahagewasu " at the end of paragraph three should be changed to " sports association chairman lahagewasulen " .

eliminate the personal income tax -lrb- reproduced from yueguang blog -rrb- .
dift wu
official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % came from the working class , and only 10 % came from the wealthy .
clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners .
while this type of tax in china has no effect on regulating the income gap or on " taking from the rich to help the poor , " neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class .
if this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax .
clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .
i propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated , to give people an opportunity to prosper .
if we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for china 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person . that would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about " people first . "
with a threshold below this level , the poor will always be poor .
yesterday cctv presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax , emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to " take from the rich " and let poor people get wealthy .
if we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled .
with anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich .
and if we 're looking at it in terms of " taking from the rich , " the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing china 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the " unreported income . "
the income of the vast majority of china 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of china , an uncontrollable black hole in china 's social oversight .
this is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem .
if china 's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich , neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ?
it would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax .
below are some of the main reasons :
1. china 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .
in china the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .
in 2004 china 's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion , accounting for about 6 % of the state 's financial revenues .
but of this 180 billion , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid by the working class .
less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy .
in china more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor .
these poor people , who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life , their children 's education , old age , illness and death , also have to pay income tax .
in all of china 's cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor .
if a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan .
a household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline .
and should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis .
and if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible .
and if only one person in a three - person family is employed , the family will have a very difficult life .
but even so , they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax .
clearly , if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan , our society is destined always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich .
our production relations are no different from the production relations in marx 's " das kapital , " constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living .
in short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich .
conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich .
2. the personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .
we should not entertain any illusions that china 's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that it can " take from the rich and give to the poor . "
in chinese society , 20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth , and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives .
in china , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people .
western countries that attack china for not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do western societies .
when god looks at china , he sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % he ca n't see clearly .
the income of the vast majority of these 20 , of upper - class citizens in china is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth .
only if china eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people .
and if china wants to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of that , and there is no compelling evidence to explain when china might eliminate unreported income .
anyhow , it is not something our generation will see .
that is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of china 's rich people .
it does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich .
a very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income .
fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so they ca n't escape even if they wanted to .
add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied .
" dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . " " the children of poor people are always poor . "
with the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold , if it were strictly enforced , 80 % of beggars would have to pay .
with a threshold set below 5000 yuan , this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car . they will always be poor .
of course , many children of poor people are able to get rich , but this came about because the parents struggled harder , tightening their belts and " skimping on food and clothing " for themselves .
now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ?
in western countries , the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich .
but these are countries ruled by law , where official income is all recorded , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution .
the situation in china is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect , it 's to increase financial revenues , and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect .
3. eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .
the vast majority of china 's 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax .
but the peasants have contractual land , they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and they have basic housing .
but if people in the cities do n't have money , everything is a struggle .
if they go shopping for food by bike , they have to pay 20 cents for parking .
they ca n't not pay the rent or they 'll have to sleep on the street .
in terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in chinese society is set at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth .
the personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % .
if we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced , which will benefit the peasants .
in china the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .
4. this will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system .
in recent years china 's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy .
the blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it 's like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring .
the proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % . if we cancel out this 6 % , we can slow down financial growth .
and in the chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system .
compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half .
and when there is too much financial investment , corruption is everywhere , all the time .
5. it promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .
chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class .
chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable .
there is no way this " 2/8 " social structure can establish a harmonious society .
eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .
in short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax .
we need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter , so as to benefit the country and the people .

something even more absurd than the " breakneck 90 m/h on a snowy night " ?? my personal experience .

title : something even more absurd than the " breakneck 90 m/h on a snowy night " ?? my personal experience .
originating site : bbs unknown space -lrb- tue jan 16 22:51:46 2007 -rrb- .
i have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article breakneck 90 m/h on a snowy night . it also reminds me of something that i experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people .
a couple of years ago , my neighbor approached me to borrow my car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport .
he also said both his wife and children wanted to go . as his car was too small and mine was big , it could make his parents more comfortable . he added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon .
although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me , we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both chinese . so i discussed with my wife back home and lent him the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon .
and then something happened ...
at 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm .
i of course agreed and asked them not to rush .
this wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures .
i comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .
my neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault . he clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .
my car was completely damaged and had been towed away .
i forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -lrb- mine was liability - only coverage -rrb- and asked the friend to send their family home .
and then the nightmare began .
the next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from
i told him part would be covered by my car insurance .
after a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford
i tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly
just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this .
she also said my car was a japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident .
she added that i should pay the money because the car was mine . i hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on . my wife -lsb- pw% -rsb- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury . she asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .
so i did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry . out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea .
the telephone rang just as i was about to go to work in the morning . i thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily . unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man .
he said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if i compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -lrb- three times -rrb- , otherwise they would see me in court .
he added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court . as a great chinese guy , how could i be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?
i also took up the weapon of law for justice .
of course , i also retained a lawyer .
out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls .
one was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident .
there was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them .
someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .
the police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .
the second call was to their lawyer .
so their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .
of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening .
the most classic one was : do n't ever dream of living a life back to china , as we have people across the country . disgusting !
here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .
i think many people will say they wo n't . i would suggest not to lend online .
however , the internet is after all virtual .
words sometimes have no emotions .
when your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "
anyhow , i was not able to do that . i lent my car to some people in need after that , and i believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .
in conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .
our side : a 02 camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . annual leave two days .
their side : one leg of the father -lrb- repaired -rrb- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown .
and most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -lrb- except children -rrb- .

a month ago , i was really desperate , i lost my current job , which i was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within a month to keep myself going .
now in this month with the christmas holiday there 's really only three weeks of actual work time , and i do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period .
despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure i could n't eat , could n't sleep ; i was simply going crazy .
but i still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense . then i started connecting with my friends in america ; i went to maimaiti to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem .
even my relatives ' friends in america and my parents ' friends all got involved .
friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments .
many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me .
there was one friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in la , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so i thought i would take it .
after the telephone interview , i flew to la , landing at 12:00 noon , and at 4:00 p.m. .
i had the interview . by then 17 - 18 hours had passed since i 'd gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
although i was too tired to walk , i still had to pump up my spirits so i 'd be in peak form for the interview .
the interview did n't last long , just two hours and it was over .
i felt the interview went well , and started to feel confident .
but on that day one senior level person was n't there , so the next day early i had to go back to talk to him .
so the next day i got up at 7:00 and ran over to chat for an hour ; that guy was nice , did n't embarrass me , so after an hour it ended happily .
after that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that i should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after new year 's , and the hr director would return and turn in the h1 .
then i went straight for the physical , and i filled out the application form , reference list , etc.
at 3:00 p.m. , the dust finally settled .
finally before christmas i received a christmas present .
although i still have n't made the final decision to go , at least i have a guaranteed - minimum choice .
so i am thanking everyone for helping me .
i hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in the new year .

michael jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
yesterday , jackson was ordered to close neverland for having failed to pay the ranch 's 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 .
unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
he 's moved on since his aquittal , like gary glitter did after his 1999 conviction , having departed last june for a bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
-lrb- '' for the people working at bahrain 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting saudi mother ....
but why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
why the bodyguards ?
and why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' -rrb-
last week 's real jackson story ran in the new york daily news , under the snappy banner `` creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
the singer was brother jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .
reading that joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
what 's new is this :
jermaine even suggested his father may have set up michael to be somehow victimized by older men .
he tells how his father would have michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to michael at those sessions .
he said he sensed something was wrong because michael would be sick for days after .
`` what was joseph doing ? '' jermaine wrote .
this lifts the jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
this should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
all that 's missing is the element of occult terror .
or maybe not : `` latoya also described being awakened in the night by joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the jackson clan had gotten with the program .
perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
-lrb- this is how i tend to think of ponchatoula 's hosanna church . -rrb-
yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
his close friendship with spectra contactee and channeller of the nine , uri geller , for one instance .
-lrb- jackson was geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . -rrb-
his entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading jermaine 's account now .
like every jackson sibling who 's tried to break from joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of michael 's threats to sue .
previously , michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
yet there they were at jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .
in the big picture michael jackson means not very much .
but his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
good stuff .
having departed last june for a bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
actually , there have been reports for the past two days of jackson back in california .
#name ?
wild wild stuff jeff !
disinformation distraction dis and dat ..
the netwerk is as sacred to the state as their mantra `` my way or total annihilation . ''
bait and switch sets the agenda .
there is no such thing as an accident .
it 's saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of saturn is spewing life - giving water .... then i see the new r.i. post is about the perrenial child michael jackson .
this day is named for saturn ...
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of saturn would in turn overthrow him ,
and saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
apparently saturn is also intimately connected with satan , masonics , and revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
nevermind -
i need a cup of coffee ...
i looked in vain for the cheney `` a hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ... and on the subject of cowardice , consider this . in a recent hunting escapade , dick cheney accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades .
there may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
but more importantly , i think , is the nature of the hunt .
these were not wild birds .
the birds were bred in captivity .
they had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by dick cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
whether you are an animal lover or not , there is something disgusting and degrading about this kind of hunt and something less than human about those who participate in it .
the link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
from madsen via boucher :
jackson 's stay at the cedars was arranged through david kuo , george w. bush 's white house director of the office of faith - based initiatives .
kuo , a former cia employee ... had been executive director of the center for effective compassion , founded in 1995 by arianna huffington ...
kuo also previously worked for the christian coalition and senator john ashcroft .
there 's also some curious neverland / disneyland connections to the `` mickey mouse club '' children who are now stars , including justin timberlake -lrb- remember the star on janet jackson 's breast ? -rrb- and brittany spears , christina aguilera ...
the piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ...
here is boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of jeff 's .
on the mark as always , jeff ,
but i thought you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develops ?
jeff boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
jackson seems to be of this type .
or more perversely , fakes that he is :
`` i was always saying -lsb- to jackson -rsb- people would n't think i was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're -lsb- expletive -rsb- funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -
lisa marie presley , in an interview quoted in a wapo article written by tina brown :
michael jackson 's false front ?
`` david geffen , be gone !
steven spielberg , be gone ! ''
the witch doctor cursing michael jackson 's enemies and blessing the tarnished king of pop himself in a voodoo ritual in switzerland in the summer of 2000 had promised that the 25 people on jackson 's enemies list -lrb- would soon be dead -rrb- ...
jackson had ordered his then business adviser , myung - ho lee , a u.s. - educated korean lawyer based in seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in mali for a voodoo chief named baba , who then had 42 cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony .
jackson had already undergone a blood bath ...
the pop star , who is said to be $ 240 million in debt , had paid six figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious egyptian woman named samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking saudi prince , purportedly nawaf bin abdulaziz al - saud , now the chief of intelligence of saudi arabia ...
http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/articles/050411roco03c hmm .
according to that vanity fair article , jacko and uri geller met through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charities mohamed fayed , the chairman of harrods in london , who believes that the c.i.a. and prince philip had princess diana and his son , dodi , killed . ''
anonymous quoted , `` jackson 's stay at the cedars was arranged through david kuo ... ''
hold on --
the cedars is the headquarters of the fellowship foundation , the creepy christianoid cult with deep political connections .
here 's a bit of the original madsen article that the michael jackson quote comes from :
in 1976 , the fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in arlington .
it set its sights on the estate of george mason iv , the cedars , located at 2301 north uhle street .
mason was one of the drafters of the bill of rights .
the fellowship , also known as the international foundation , bought the property from charles piluso .
although not much is known about piluso , the los angeles times reported that howard hughes , the man with whom fellowship senator ralph owen brewster once sparred , also lived there .
according to a senior pentagon official , the cedars had been used as a cia safe house prior to the fellowship 's purchase of the estate .
the fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the cedars , the money coming from tom phillips , the ceo of raytheon , and ken olsen , the ceo of digital equipment corporation .
sanford mcdonnell of mcdonnell douglas corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the fellowship through full gospel business men 's fellowship international , an activity linked to fellowship core member pat robertson .
suffer the little children , eh ?
if this is what power & wealth does to you , i 'm damn glad i have neither .
you said , `` perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''
could n't agree more .
i think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
my experience happened when i was 15 .
a friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
we were both enamored with kerouac & jim morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
he was muscle for a pittsburgh madam named tex gill .
she dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in pgh .
he was into black magick & crowley & booze & drugs & on & on .
so , one night , we 're at his apartment , drunk out of our minds ,
& my buddy passes out .
i continue drinking .
at one point , i glance at this older guy ,
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
i think , ' what the fuck ? '
but i 'm pretty goddamn wasted
& reality is having a helluva time penetrating the fog in my head .
he notices that i 'm kind of staring at him .
he stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .
he drops it on the couch next to me .
as he 's sitting down , he says , `` see anything you like ? '' & then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & i broke his nose with my elbow .
make no mistake though , up till that point , the guy scared the shit out of me .
but , lucky for me , my reaction was see red anger instead of cowering fear .
after i hit him , i jumped up , ran into his kitchen & grabbed a big old butcher knife , ran back into the room & proceeded to kick my buddy into consciousness & drag his comatose ass the hell out of there .
now , for me , the interesting part happened years later .
at the time , my buddy & i were selling things . my buddy had a real good supplier for these things but it was his secret .
at one point , my buddy could n't pick up the shipment so i had to go .
before i left , he had to explain to me that his supplier was none other than freddie feelup .
i decided to go .
he was now closer to 40 & just a hollow shell of his former self .
friendless , his only company being neighborhood teens looking to party .
he kept one room empty except for 4 black candles in each of its corners .
he would read curses aimed at people who pissed him off .
really pathetic .
about a year later , a few of those teens took an intense dislike to freddie & the beat him to to death .
i ca n't imagine why .
can you ?
i apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,
... i do n't know how you folks would classify pedophilia .
maybe a 30 year old man & a 15 year old boy does n't qualify .
i wonder about that myself , but i have to say that when i was 30 , i was n't plying 15 year old girls with booze & copping feels .
i 'll shut up now .
speaking of pat robertson -
i remembered something about him being linked with victor bout and the uae two - step currently going on : bout was liberian dictator charles taylor 's primary arms and diamond smuggler ...
taylor , who is now in exile in nigeria , was a business partner with christian coalition founder pat robertson ... in a cayman islands front company called freedom gold , ltd .
in fact , freedom gold was headquartered at robertson 's cbn offices in virginia beach , virginia .
robertson 's african interests also crossed paths with bout 's in another country -- the former zaire .
robertson 's african development company used the cover of robertson 's tax - exempt `` operation blessing '' to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war - ravaged zaire -lrb- now congo -rrb- .
one of bout 's many assets is new millennium air company of gambia .
the director of this firm is `` baba jobe '' .
-lrb- hmmm -
`` baba '' ... -rrb-

my question is , when is a victim guilty of abuse ?
jackson is definitely a mind - control , sra victim .
he 's programmed .
neverland sounds like a cryptic command from mkultra wizard of oz programming .
the bizarre from black - to - white and physical transformation must be the result of biotech advances .
if he does abuse ' his ' children , is he ' guilty ' as such if he is programmed ?
i suspect he is a brilliant cover or red - herring used as a shield by very powerful forces , responsible for god - knows - what at his now - abandoned ranch .
it 's very effective , as many ' feel ' that whilst mj is naive he 's not capable of the evil associated with pedophile activity .
this may not be the case , as the public ' persona ' is merely an ' alter ' personality and he may have many other ' personalities ' which are dark .
then comes the question whether his programmers were programmed themselves .
if so , then they are all guilty of such abuse , whilst being innocent at the same time !
as most abuse is generational , the whole mind - control subject really has to be brought out in the open .
the very technology and tools used on the mind which harm can then be used to heal .
brr , pied piper .
i remember being spooked by that story as a kid .
heck of a story to tell children .
talking about strange coincidences ... i was trying to write a science fiction story a while back involving star gate type research .
i was looking for a cool name for an undercover x-files type military - occult agency .
thought of ' spectre ' but that seemed too james bondish , and modified it to ' spectra ' .
thinking rainbow - type symbology .
then i find out that ' spectra ' is actually a name with significance in the community .
what the ...
... of course , i did read a lot of weird stuff in passing as a kid ,
it 's certainly possible that i came across it and forgot .
i was n't consciously aware of it , certainly .
it 's the most disappointingly *cheesy* 1960s sci - fi kind of name for an astral entity to use , that 's for sure .
i never did write that story .
is n't michael jackson , and the entire jackson clan , jehovah 's witness ?
there was no mention made of this in either the main post or comments ....
it would seem to me that their must be some relationship between that cult organization and all the `` high weirdness '' going on ....
no ?
.... and it is a cult .
fbi finally releases report on missing children . agency unveils surprising statistics : about one - third of lost kids are black
-- ap
since 1985 nearly 13 million children missing -lrb- those reported -rrb- .
an average of 615,874 per year since 1985 . 791,687 in 1995 alone .
this is an extraordinary group here .
i appreciate your candor and your capacity to build a knowledge base with each contributor adding to the thread that moves me in a sonambulant noiseless rush toward the truth .
we are living the dieing
and that is just as productive and rewarding as any other dimension of spirit that i have experienced
if there is just one thing that disappoints me it is that all of the posters here prefer to be anonymous .
it would be wise for you to `` be '' yourself .
i tried to find emails for any that list a profile or website , but none `` none '' of you are out there .
contact me at my profile email should you care to disclose yourself .
i would like to invite you to participate in fshod if that is not too much to ask .
maybe we remain anonymous in preparation for the future .
i 'm surprised i have n't heard this mentioned anywhere before , as it ties in perfectly with jeff 's bizarro jacko tabloid post :
in an interview with blender -lrb- ca n't remember what issue , but janet 's on the cover -rrb- , janet talks at length about having mulitiple personalities .
i ca n't remember all the details , but there 's janet , the normal pop star , and among others -lrb- and perhaps the most notable in this context -rrb- one she calls `` strawberry , '' who is geared towards explicit sexual activities .
as i understand , this is a classic alters description .
a real man would at least let a former board member be able to read the reason he had been banned , but , i forgot i was dealing with a coward !
antiaristo will be disappointed , or has he already been banned , too ???
a coward dies a thousand deaths . a hero dies but once !!!!!!!!
saint alexander the foolish , circa third millennium , a.d . janet jackson ;
`` strawberry bounce '' lyrics :
bump the beat
just watch the way i pump it
the way i work it 's gon na keep you cumin'
do a dance that 's so sensual
i 'ma make you lose control
do n't trip
you know you wan na watch this
i 'm a pro you wo n't be disappointed
gon na leave you beggin' for more
i 'ma make you lose control
glad someone finally mentioned janet .
i think the practice of black magic is something she and her brother have in common .
one mus n't forget her now infamous superbowl `` nipple '' stunt .
rather than the ridiculous accident censors tried to make it out to be , i think it has to be recognized as a planned , purposeful piece of black magic , perpetraited literally in front of the world , on a very alchemically significant day and time
-lrb- goes way beyond a ' publicity stunt , does n't it ? ' -rrb-
a friend even suggests that during her much earlier ' rythm nation ' period , in which she dons a black uniform and uses strange , synchopated hand movements in her video dance routine , that that too , is a kind of twilight language , intended on sending a specific message , in order to have a desired effect .
it 's possible that jacksons have been using the occult arts for a long , long time . i 'd love to hear someone else 's thoughts on this - here 's a link to just a wee bit more about jackson and her alleged mpd -
http://dave.typepad.com/dave/2004/06/janet_jacksons_.html
i posted above that the cedars , where michael jackson was mentioned as having stayed for a time , was the center of the fellowship foundation .
i just ran across the fellowship foundation again , when looking for something to explain the anomalous situation of recently - disgraced republican shoplifter claude a. allen .
the quote below is from the larouchies -- and thus , as always , not to be considered 100 % reliable --
but in this case it fits in so well with the ongoing discussion that i 'm tentatively inclined to trust it :
delay 's career and power became at the same time a central project for all three of the shadow partners , grover norquist , jack abramoff and ralph reed .
delay was by no means a random point of interest .
tom delay staggered into washington as a freshman congressman in 1984 , a terrible drunk , his life dissolving .
rep. frank wolf -lrb- r - va. -rrb- approached him with a road to salvation .
he reportedly showed delay a videotape that made him weep .
tom delay then radically changed his life , turning his soul over to higher powers .
but by all reliable accounts , delay became a much nastier , a fearsomely un-christian individual .
frank wolf represented an old `` black operations '' soul - robbing agency known as the fellowship foundation .
practicing secrecy on about the same level as the national security agency , the fellowship does conduct one public function --
it runs the huge annual congressional / presidential prayer breakfast in washington , with similar events managed inside the pentagon and at other government and military sites .
the fellowship foundation -lrb- earlier called international christian leadership and a succession of cover names -rrb- was created before world war ii by the organization of the pro-nazi frank buchman .
sen. h. alexander smith -lrb- r - n.j. -rrb- , buchman 's lieutenant who in 1940 had called for a joint world dictatorship of the united states , britain , and nazi germany , brought the fellowship into acceptance in washington .
in the 1950s , the group was sponsored by former nazi ss officer , holland 's prince bernhard , and the dutch royal family .
the fellowship runs a house near the u.s. capitol , where congressmen and senators , who are members , live .
for example , sen. sam brownback -lrb- r - kans. -rrb- , the delirious end - timer , has lived in the cult 's house in washington .
raytheon ceo tom phillips and other figures in the military - industrial complex , pay the bills .
the fellowship specializes in taking over the lives of potentially powerful individuals who have become somehow ruined , and promising them dominion in the world if they will play along .
watergate dirty - trickster charles colson , when he was on his way to prison and suddenly powerless , was recruited , and turned his life over to the fellowship .
colson 's prison fellowship ministries is a subordinate unit of the cult , with its tentacles in most prisons in the united states .
after tom delay was zapped , charles colson became delay 's personal guru . colson 's militancy for the end - times war on muslims has made him a congenial companion to jack abramoff in their keeping of delay -- abramoff has repeatedly led tom to israel to call for all - out war against the arabs .
and christian coalition co-founder pat robertson was himself a product of the fellowship magic .
robertson was the good - for - nothing playboy son of sen. a. willis robertson -lrb- r - va. -rrb- , the chairman of the senate finance committee .
pat began speaking in tongues and uttering prophecies under the guidance of harald bredesen , a master training agent of the fellowship group , who had proved himself to the highest circles of british intelligence .
pat robertson started off as assistant pastor to bredesen , whose intelligence partners , the full gospel businessmen 's fellowship , raised the money to expand robertson 's and bredesen 's virginia - based christian broadcasting network -lrb- cbn -rrb- toward global power status .
the sentence i put in boldface is *extremely* interesting .
was n't there a michael jackson video where he was envisioning himself as ruler of the world or some such ?
to anonymous 9:30 re cults :
`` the reason fear can arise so strongly is that you already have a very strong experience of being brainwashed and used in cultish behavior . this cult is called society and its ' cult - ure ' gives rise to suffering .
if you look closely , everything that is associated with cult behavior can lisewise be found in society 's behavior .
the same means of control are used : the constant reinforcement that you are helpless without society , that you can not survive without obeying its rules and that you will go to hell if you do n't obey the tenets of its religion . ''

this site monitors janet jackson weight !
http://www.egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/janet-jackson/janet-jackson-is-too-fat-to-sing
anonymous one , i recall reading somewhere that lisa marie was a member of l.ron 's cult .
you will notice that michael 's real troubles started after he suied sony chief tommy mattola , who was heard to say `` he 'll live to regret the day '' .
do n't ever think of fucken with the evil bastards in the music biz , later .
here 's a description of that michael jackson item i was remembering :
by the time the release of 1995 's history album -- a double album of greatest hits and new tracks -- approached , michael had fully realized a new perception of himself , one that was truly larger than life .
history was hyped with a four - minute teaser video .
this extravagant production begins with a colossal army goose - stepping through a european city in crisp , tan uniforms , waving red flags and sporting red - and - black insignias .
military music pounds .
crowds swell at the sidelines , screaming and crying .
the implication seems to be these men represent nazis .
but then , their leader is revealed to be michael , marching right up front .
when peasant workers break free to touch michael , they are immediately swallowed by soldiers .
suddenly , it is night , and a tarp - covered , skyscraper - sized structure looms over the poor nation as choppers spray spotlights across it .
brainwashed fans scream , salute with one arm and light candles with religious zeal .
signs proclaiming `` king of pop , '' a title michael disavowed to oprah only two years earlier , are everywhere , emphasizing the word `` king . ''
finally , the tarp drops , and it is , of course , a gargantuan , bronze statue of michael , fists clenched defiantly , his star insignia prominent , yet his face still somehow child - like and unthreatening .
the video is a highly disturbing piece of work .
his bloated sense of importance is not only chilling , it is threatening .
suddenly , michael 's perfect world of oz / neverland is forced to be compared with an aryan nation , one that substitutes children for hitler 's master race .
large image of the michael jackson history statue .
there is some sort of an emblem with a star on his shoulder , but it 's at an angle and not easy to make out clearly .
'' ... a haughty spirit goeth before a fall . ''
btw - and off topic :
check out this superb psyop image .
jeff , i do n't think even you could do better than this :
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11800917/
remember who janet shared the stage with at the superbowl ?
yes , you remember correctly : former mousketeer justin timberlake .
hmmm .
the plot thickens .
jw's and child abuse .
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/live_forums/2124808.stm
btw jeff - i 'd caught the geller / jackson connection a while back and posted on the discussion board .
fascinating how this all seems to be inter-related .
hmmm ...
in march 2003 jackson distraction - o - mania was part of the media smokescreen that led up the iraq war ...
and now fox news and other rabid - right media outlets have once again taken to whipping on jackson ...
-lrb- like any sane people really care about what the hell mj is doing any more . -rrb-
a signs of another impending misadventure in the mideast ?
and what 's with uri geller 's links to mj ?
anyone else smell a whiff of that whole prophet yahweh sideshow from awhile back ? trivial , but here 's stargods ' comprehensive analysis of jacko :
regarding the jw reference .
i do n't think we need see a plot in every wood pile .
the jw considers itself the kingdom of god on earth .
-lrb- ' kindom hall ' -rrb-
so it is only to be expected that they do not see a reason to run to and report everything to the government .
the same goes for the roman catholic church .
but the rcc has had a widespread problem with this regard , doubltlessly because their policy / doctrine of a celibate priesthood simply attracts these deviants .
i doubt any such problem exist on the same proportionate scale in the jw heirarchy .
besides that , ca n't you see the embedded mind control in that article , as well as all general media output .
the message is : `` big brother must be informed !
only big brother can manage society ! ''
see , it 's the hegelian dialectic at work .
eveyone needs to sharpen their awareness of this shit .
as long as big brother is the answer for everything , big brother will be everything .
-lrb- if people do n't want their kids pederastized , but yet they entrust them to ' guys in gowns ' i just wonder what the hell are they thinking anyway ? -rrb-
i 'd watch the peter pan speculations , unless you know what versions you are discussing and can differentiate between them accurately .
some of the assumptions i 've seen -lrb- such as a couple made by tim boucher and fantastic planet in last year 's postings linked here -rrb- may have looked like they worked to support their thesis , but in actuality have either a tenuous or no connection to the core peter pan mythos .
do n't make up things like peter abducting children that you ca n't substantiate .
peter pan was a work in progress for jm barrie , who kept tinkering with it over the years .
to understand what it actually means to michael jackson and what you might speculate he is enacting , you have to know where on the continuum of peter pans his internalized peter -lrb- no , not that kind of peter -rrb- lies .
novel , play ?
musical , cartoon ?
shadow of a shadow of a remembered story ?
in one of the oldest versions , peter pan in kensington gardens -lrb- extracted from the little white bird -rrb- , is only a week old .
he escaped from his home when he was seven days old because he remembered how he could fly when he was a bird before he was a human ,
and that wildness is still in him , as it is with all children .
barrie 's only cryptic instructions on character development to nina boucicault , the first actress to play peter , was that she was to remember that peter is a bird , and is one day old .
in kensington gardens he watches out for children who have fallen un-noticed out of their perambulators .
if a bad fairy finds them , or they perish from the cold an dark overnight in the park , peter digs them graves and makes them headstones .
in peter and wendy , the lost boys are the ones who fall out of their perambulators when their nurse is not looking .
if they are not claimed in seven days , `` they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses . ''
a far cry from the stealing of children .
peter and the lost boys crave a mother to tell them stories .
it 's ironic that while their own lives are far more exotic than the fairy tales wendy tells , it 's those fictions that they want , told by a mother .
barrie says quite explicitly in peter and wendy that it is wendy who does the tempting to keep peter with her , not the other way around .
it is she who asks if michael and john could come too .
if those of you with the abduction theory would like to give specific quotes and information on where it is shown that peter abducted the children , please do .
but i think you are making it up from a version that does n't exist in reality , or that ca n't be tied to michael jackson .
we do n't gain better understanding of the inner workings of michael jackson by distorting the material on which we purportedly base our theories .
jeff - i just have to say that i love the rigorous intuition live365 channel .
i 've been listening to it to the last couple of days and just bought dylan 's ' oh mercy ' .
how does the copyright thing work on a live365 stream ?
avalon , can you recommend a good work of commentary and analysis on jm barrie 's works ?
- sepka the space weasel
was michael jackson influenced by bob fosse 's `` snake in the grass '' character from the 1974 movie the little prince ?
has anyone else seen this scene ?
bob fosse 's snake looks and moves would be imitated -lrb- and made more popular -rrb- years later by the king of pop , michael jackson .
view the video here : http://youtube.com/watch?v=l8mjsgpj1iu
about the jw thing , i work with a couple of them -lrb- btw , some of the most respectable people i know .
which is why i decided to ask ... -rrb- ,
and i had a chance to ask them about mj and the child abuse , if they knew anything .
about mj they said , he is definately not a jw , despite what he says .
provocative lyrics and grabbing ones crotch in public , does n't fit with their defination of ' christian ' .
they said all they knew was that his mother -lrb- who apparently is still a member -rrb- took him to their church as a kid .
the father apparently had little or no involvement at all .
as for the child abuse , i have to agree with the post above , you can find abuse and ' sick ' individuals in any organization ,
but you have too look at the proportion to the rest of society .
one of my friends is an ' elder ' -lrb- soething like a ' local church leader ' -rrb- ,
but he also said their instructions say that if they hear of any abuse they are to follow local laws , which usually requires them to inform the police asap .
and if the abuse is at all serious to report it to the police regardless .
though i do n't agree with all of their beliefs , i know these guys well enough to call them friends .
so in their respect , after reading some of the other comments , i decided to listen to their side before passing judgement .
we should all be careful not to pass judgement on entire groups of people based on the apparent actions of a few .
that is what hitler tried to do .
with thiking like that , even if we got rid of the evil elite , a new set of ' evil elite ' would rise again in their place .
that seems to be the nature of man , though .
we have all got to do what we can without needlessly attacking the innocent .
remember , group hatred only plays into their hands , be it racial , religious , or class .
sepka , the two reference books i have on peter pan are : fifty years of peter pan , roger lancelyn green , pub. by peter davies , london , 1954 .
it 's pretty scarce at this point , though you might be able to find a copy to read through inter-library loan .
the peter pan chronicles , bruce k. hanson , birch lane press , ny , 1993
i have n't really delved into barrie 's psyche from the biographical end , it 's peter and wendy as an extraordinary piece of writing that has always fascinated me .
... and if you listen to `` my way '' by sinatra , backwards , the real answer will be revealed .

uri geller was one of mj 's handlers apparently .
in the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major hong kong media .
with their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused hong kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
the world 's fifth disney park will soon open to the public here .
the most important thing about disney is that it is a global brand .
well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed hong kong with new respect .
then welcome to the official writing ceremony of hong kong disneyland .
the construction of hong kong disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
in january of that year , the hong kong government turned over to disney corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of lantau island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
one .
since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in hong kong .
as its neighbor on lantau island , hong kong international airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
mickey mouse 's new home , settling on chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .
there 's only one month left before the opening of hong kong disneyland on september 12 .
the subway to disney has already been constructed .
at subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
meanwhile , the disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
for two years , disney has constantly maintained its mystery . no media have been allowed to enter for photos .
we took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
however , before any of the disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards disney .
on our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
no one can enter otherwise .
video recording is especially forbidden . ah , everything is top secret .
if pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
although disney corporation chose hong kong as the venue for the chinese disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland china tourist market .
since the implementation of the individual visit scheme between hong kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit hong kong .
from the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to hong kong .
well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
at this point , it has been about two years .
also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased . hong kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
when in hong kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in mong kok .
you can go to burn incense and make a vow at the repulse bay , where all deities gather .
you can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in hong kong .
you can ascend victoria peak to get a panoramic view of victoria harbor 's beautiful scenery .
or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
after dark , cruise victoria harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
every corner of hong kong is filled with fun .
meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the hong kong tourism industry bring us ?
over the past 28 years , the ocean park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to hong kong .
watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the ocean theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
or ride the giant ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of hong kong island and the south china sea .
these items , which were the pride of the ocean park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in hong kong for some time .
however , since disney entered hong kong , the ocean park , sharing the same city as disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
to improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
it seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
that is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists . it seems that those attractions like the north pole and the marine life center will also be renovated after several years .
are they going to be different from what they are now ?
they will be , in ten years .
ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
it looks like we will also bring in whales .
er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government . groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
yes .
the area of hong kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
the population is dense .
natural resources are relatively scarce .
however , the clever hong kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the hong kong tourism industry .
among these is the avenue of stars .
entering hollywood of the east ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
he is my .
she is my goddess , ah .
please stay with us on new world travel .
hong kong has always worn the crown of hollywood of the east .
over the past 100 years of film history , hong kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
they have shortened the distance between hong kong and the world .
hong kong movies have even become a window for the world to see hong kong , which have made the image of metropolitan hong kong more prominent internationally .
for this reason , in 2004 , on the waterfront promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of hong kong island and victoria harbor , the hong kong tourism board also constructed the avenue of stars , memorializing hong kong 's 100 - year film history .
here , tourists can learn about hong kong 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
hong kong is a busy metropolis .
even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
across from the avenue of stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw as our victoria harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
so , one idea was to transform victoria harbor into a performance stage .
er , each key building is like a performer .
it is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .
let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
the pla hong kong garrison plaza , bank of china tower , at 8:00 every saturday night , hsbc main building .
their performances will be on schedule . center of the east central .
ten landmark buildings located on hong kong island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
some , er , cities have consulted with us .
uh-huh .
their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
yes .
the answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
er , of course , after sars , we felt that all of hong kong hopes to be involved , so that the hong kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
hong kong wetland park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the hong kong sar government for advancing the hong kong tourism industry .
this is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the hong kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
hong kong wetland park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
in the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
, er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our wetland park .
ha , entirely different .
quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the wetland park exploration center .
lastly , farthest away you can see putian of shenzhen .
then , , on the bridge is hong kong and outside is shenzhen .
you can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment . children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many hong kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like . look over there .
they are going to be ripe soon .
the long one over there .
oh .
yes .
, with ears , ah .
where ?
ah , here .
perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
, let them get some understanding .
mai po marshes adjacent to wetland park is a major wildlife habitat within asia .
each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over hong kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
as a result , three different types of aviaries were built in hong kong wetland park .
these have become the best spots to observe birds .
among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
it is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
uh-huh .
ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
wow .
um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to hong kong to spend the winter .
some of them , er , have stayed in hong kong wetland park .
uh-huh .
so , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention . uh-huh .
wetland park workers are now in the middle of intensive work . they will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 discover hong kong year campaign .
ah , we have established the year 2006 as discover hong kong year .
why is that ?
because , as everyone knows , our disneyland will open in september of this year .
in addition , we will have ngong ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the giant buddha .
they add to what we already have , like the avenue of stars , which is also very famous .
moreover , er , we are including our software .
hong kong 's software is very well known .
like what 's used in our symphony of lights .
we hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 discover hong kong year .
without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
a dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
because your line connects us with two --
in recent years , hong kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from hong kong island to kowloon and the new territory .
two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 discover hong kong year are located on lantau island of the new territory . for this reason , lantau island has become a new hong kong tourism popular spot .
the earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze buddha .
in chinese buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five buddhas .
therefore , hong kong 's tian tan giant buddha at the most southern tip of china , together with lingshan giant buddha in the east , leshan giant buddha in the west , yungang giant buddha in the north , and longmen giant buddha in the central plains , exist as the representative buddhas for each of the five directions of china .
as a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
however , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
since this giant bronze buddha settled on lantau island , the world renowned hong kong international airport at chek lap kok and disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
the important status of lantau island is increasingly apparent .
no , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
in the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting hong kong , zhuhai , and macao .
in 1992 -- could n't go in summer --
so , after their return , macao , and hong kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected . it 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
one has to go up to shenzhen , dongguan , then go through panyu , keep going up , to zhongshan , and certainly go to zhuhai , then pass through zhuhai to get to macao .
for a hong kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
a full twenty years ago , hopewell holdings group chairman wu ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .
with this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
however , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
this is what we have seen since 1999 .
anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
well , originally the construction of the new --
with this new hong kong - zhuhai - macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , hong kong , macao , and zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
macao is this way , and zhuhai is this way .
from the perspective of either hong kong , macao , or zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
er , %pw zhuhai for sightseeing tours , macao for entertainment , and we have disneyland and , other attractions in hong kong .
each place has different attractions of its own .
so , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland china or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
once the zhuhai - hong kong - macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in macao before having fun at disneyland just an hour later .
promotion of hong kong disneyland has long since begun .
however , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
ah , currently it has been decided that disney will open on september 12 .
there 's also what we call soft opening .
ah , they are now rehearsing .
ah , , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in september .
well , i am very confident , that when our tourists come to disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
the wonder tour will start from hong kong . this dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
it continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .

ww ii landmarks on the great earth of china : eternal memories of taihang mountain
standing tall on taihang mountain is the monument to the hundred regiments offensive .
it is composed of a primary stele , secondary steles , a huge round sculpture and beacon tower , and the great wall , among other things .
a primary stele , three secondary steles , and two inscribed steles .
the hundred regiments offensive was the campaign of the largest scale launched by the eighth route army during the war of resistance against japan .
this campaign broke through the japanese army 's blockade to reach base areas behind enemy lines , stirring up anti-japanese spirit throughout the nation and influencing the situation of the anti-fascist war of the people worldwide .
this is zhuanbi village , wuxiang county of shanxi province , where the eighth route army was headquartered back then .
on a wall outside the headquarters we found a map . this map was the eighth route army 's depiction of the mediterranean sea situation at that time .
this map reflected the european battlefield situation .
in 1940 , the german army invaded and occupied czechoslovakia , poland , the netherlands , belgium , and france .
it was during this year that the japanese army developed a strategy to rapidly force the chinese people into submission by the end of 1940 . in may , the japanese army launched --
from one side , it seized an important city in china called yichang .
um , , uh , through yichang , it could directly reach chongqing . ah , that threatened chongqing .
then they would , ah , bomb these large rear areas such as chongqing .
so , along with the coordinated , er , economic blockade , military offensives , and strategic bombings , er , a simultaneous attack was launched in hong kong to lure the kmt government into surrender .
the progress of this coordinated offensive was already very entrenched by then .
by 1940 , china 's war of resistance against japan had entered a stalemate .
the situation on our side and the enemy 's side was intertwined . the eighth route army guerrillas were extraordinarily active , creating more and more trouble for the japanese army in north china .
hayao tada , commander of the japanese north china area army , adopted a strategy of siege warfare to deal with the eighth route army .
the specific method was building a closely connected transport network , with a road for every village and defensive towers on every road .
roads and railways were used as links to connect all of north china into a solid , widespread siege , in order to strangle the eighth route army and its base areas in this net .
as part of the japanese army 's strategy of siege warfare , railways and roads had actually become the japanese army 's weapons of war , becoming a great threat to the base areas .
in december 1939 , commander - in - chief zhu de and vice commander peng dehuai of the eighth route army received a top - secret telegram from commander lu zhengcao of the jizhong military district , among other people .
the telegram said that the japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard - like roads to divide the jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other , causing the eighth route army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability .
before the hundred regiments offensive in 1940 , an inclination to compromise , ah , surrender , was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in china .
well , on the battlefield behind enemy lines , in order to take over , consolidate the area under its occupation , japan began a new strategy .
that was to use railways as a pillar , roads as a chain , and strongholds as a lock , to carry out siege warfare in an attempt to divide the base areas behind enemy lines , ah , so as , er , to cut off their communication with one another .
in addition , it relied on this cage , ah , to further strengthen its assaults against the base areas .
er .
so , it was amidst such a grave international and domestic situation that the eighth route army led by the chinese communist party , ah , launched , ah , a strategic offensive called the hundred regiments offensive .
this plot of the japanese army drew great attention from zhu de and peng dehuai of eighth route army headquarters .
after meticulous studies and painstaking preparations by many parties , a battle plan based on surprise was formulated .
on july 22 , 1940 , a campaign preparation order to attack the zhengtai railway , jointly signed by zhu de , peng dehuai , and zuo quan , was sent to yan'an and all units of the eighth route army .
what was the , purpose and goal of this campaign ?
it was to break through the japanese army 's siege policy against base areas behind enemy lines , and to avert the crisis of china 's compromise and surrender .
it was to overcome this crisis .
well , the hundred regiments offensive was divided into three phases .
beginning from august 20 , from august 20 to september 10 , the main purpose of the campaign was to sabotage the zhengtai railway .
the zhengtai railway started from zhengding , hebei in the east and ended in taiyuan in the west , with a total length of 243 kilometers traversing the taihang mountain range .
during the war of resistance against japan , the zhengtai railway was a key strategic transportation line for the japanese army in north china . it was also one of the major blockade lines for causing destruction to anti-japanese base areas .
along this railway line was the niangziguan pass , a natural barrier , and the jingjing coalmine , a key fuel base in yangquan for the japanese military in north china .
outside of taiyuan and shijiazhuang , the japanese military deployed the 4th , 8th , and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments , which were scattered among 50 strongholds along the railway line .
the situation was getting worse and worse for the eighth route army and the anti-japanese areas behind enemy lines .
actions had to be taken to break through the blockade .
on a night in late july 1940 , the atmosphere in zhuanbi village in shaanxi was unusual . villager xiao jianghe has a vivid memory of this piece of history .
on that dark night , everyone was sleeping when human voices and neighing horses were heard within the village . people all got up . did something happen ?
some folks got up .
opening the street gate , they saw a soldier standing by the gate .
folks , go back , go back , nothing is wrong .
our troops are just going to stay here for the night .
do n't say you are scared . our commander is coming . i am telling you to go back to sleep peacefully . ah , so we went back to sleep .
ah , why should you come out if you were told not to ?
by the time we got up early the following morning , the sports ground in zhuanbi village was packed with soldiers who had stationed there .
essentially the entire enemy had been destroyed .
it was an arduous battle .
at 10:00 p.m. on august 20 , 1940 , various units of the eighth route army launched a full - scale offensive according to the general plan . the head of the county people 's armed forces commission was named zhao yemin .
zhao yemin came , ah , bringing a group of armed personnel and some things .
upon arriving , he relayed an order , saying the road from yangquan to hedi must be cut off tonight , with the electrical wires slashed .
he himself would bring , this group of people to blow up that wudu bridge .
led by nie rongzhen , the shanxi - chahar - hebei military district was ready for an offensive , while at the same time , fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along the zhengtai railway , launching fierce attacks on japanese military strongholds along the railway line .
it was also during the night of august 20 that the 129th division directed by division commander liu bocheng and political commissar deng xiaoping , with eight regiments , including two regiments of the 1st dare - to - die corps and eight independent battalions , formed left - flank and right - flank commandos and a central contingent .
on the night of august 20 , offensives were launched against most of the japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of the zhengtai railway .
additionally , two regiments , together with local armed forces in places such as pingding , liaoxian , and yushe , carried out sabotage on the pingliao and yuliao roads and pinned down the enemy at various points , ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear .
current estimates are that this section was taken care of in less than four hours , three hours .
after this was taken care of , four blockhouses were blown up .
by digging tunnels , they charged out the center .
only then did they , wipe out the enemy . more than two hundred enemy soldiers were eliminated in a single blow .
it was still during this night that the 120th division , directed by division commander he long and political commissar guan xiangying , with 20 regiments , sabotaged the northern section of the tongpu railway and some main roads west of the railway . it also took over strongholds at yangfangkou , kangjiahui , and fengrui village , cutting off the northern section of the tongpu railway and the roads from xinxian to jingle and fenyang .
in order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at the zhengtai railway and the northern section of the tongpu railway , the 129th division and the shanxi - chahar - hebei military district also ordered their units to deploy more than 50 regiments yang to lishi in cooperation with militias , to launch widespread sabotage and raids on the pinghan , pingsui , beining , baijin , jinpu , and deshi railway lines , among others , as well as some main roads and many strongholds occupied by the japanese army .
on the afternoon of august 22 , peng dehuai was listening to the combat operation director report on battle developments at eighth route army operational headquarters .
when asked about the actual combat strength of the eighth route army , the combat operation director reported : there are 30 regiments along the zhengtai line , 15 regiments along the lugou bridge - handan section of the pinghan line , 12 regiments along the datong - hongdong section in tonghu county , and four regiments along the tianjin - dezhou section of the jinpu line , with a total of 105 regiments entering the campaign .
with a wave of his hand , peng dehuai said that despite being over 100 regiments , let 's call this campaign the hundred regiments offensive .
that afternoon , peng dehuai first used the name hundred regiments offensive in telegrams sent to various military corps and the central military commission .
a total of 105 regiments participated in the hundred regiments offensive .
well , it was a force of more than 200,000 soldiers .
in addition to that , er , no less than 400,000 militiamen , guerrillas , and civilians , er , voluntarily participated in the offensive .
so , there were probably 600,000 - plus soldiers and civilians .
the hundred regiments offensive dealt a devastating blow to the enemy at shi'nao mountain . our troops were strong , troops were strong .
er , and those in charge of logistics and support were able to follow in time .
er , , er , the anti-japanese vanguard team was composed of all young people in their 20s ; all young people , all in their , 20s .
this is shi'nao mountain , situated in yangquan , shanxi , a strategic passage of the zhengtai railway back then .
on august 21 , 1940 , in order to pin down japanese troops stationed in yangquan and to cover for militiamen sabotaging the western section of the zhengtai railway , the 129th division of the eighth route army ordered the main regiment of its 385th brigade , the 14th regiment led by brigade commander chen xilian , to head directly for shi'nao mountain to seize the high ground .
like a sharp sword , civilians in the western section broke through the strategic passage .
frustrated and angry , the japanese army immediately deployed a large number of troops in an attempt to retake shi'nao mountain .
to the enemy 's complete surprise , desolate shi'nao mountain had been turned into a strong combat fortress by our troops in less than a night .
like a lion with its mouth wide open , towering and rugged shi'nao mountain was constantly waiting for any invaders who dared come close .
the night before , we destroyed the roads and cut off all electrical and railway lines , making it impossible for it to communicate .
it did not know how many of us went to destroy the roads , whether it was the eighth route army or not , the regulars , or others . it did not know , right ?
after all , its telephones had stopped working .
yeah , the roads had been cut off , with its vehicles unable to drive back and forth .
the following seven days and nights were extremely tough .
starting from the 23rd , the japanese army in yangquan , backed by helicopters , launched nonstop fierce attacks on shi'nao mountain using chemical weapons .
during the shi'nao mountain battle , our soldiers died in large numbers . so many died that the clean - up was done in batches .
in addition , many people were poisoned when toxic gas was released .
they were poisoned and did not know how to protect themselves against the poison . they simply crawled on the ground and wetted handkerchiefs in the rain to cover their noses against the poison .
eh , medics were quite busy .
several days of autumn rain turned the combat trenches extremely muddy . the eighth route army officers and soldiers soaking in the muddy water fought their powerful enemy with utmost effort . with bombs exploding next to the trenches , they showed no fear at all .
when their blood turned the yellow soil red , they applied iodine solution to their wounds and closed them with bandages .
they wrapped them with bandages , and that was it .
under the powerful offensive of the eighth route army , the enemy was only able to defend itself , without any strength to fight back .
the battle proceeded very smoothly , with the initiative steadily in the grasp of the eighth route army .
since the strategic objective of the hundred regiments offensive was to smash the enemy 's blockade of bases , it was of critical importance to destroy the roads and remove strongholds .
the various units of the eighth route army taking part in the battle wasted no time destroying the roads .
they proposed not to leave behind a single rail , a single cross tie , a single railway station , a single blockhouse , a single bridge , or a single electricity pole .
they mobilized and organized the masses and won over the railway staff , making great effort to destroy the railroad , the stations , and related facilities by means including dismantlement , explosion , fire , and water .
i was in charge of this , er , and --
er , er , due to this -- to cut off the electricity , er , considered a deputy commander - in - chief responsible for these electricity lines .
, i was responsible for this project , ah .
the militiamen were divided into two groups . one was responsible only for cutting electrical wires , and the other for destroying roads .
we people , ah , were under his command for the time being .
we all took part in destroying roads .
from the zhengtai road , from , um , zhengding to , um , shijiazhuang , to taiyuan , more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads .
most important at that time along the zhengtai road was mainly to destroy the jinxi coal mine .
soldiers used hay cutters to sever the wire net , charging into the station and destroying the machine room and water tower , and then started to destroy the road .
of the three to four thousand civilians participating in the battle , one soldier was added to every squad of 16 people formed .
while destroying roads , there was clear - cut division of labor .
some took off screws ; some uprooted rail spikes ; some knocked off joint bars ; some removed cross ties ; some carried away rails . for cutting electrical wires , the militiamen in the village were waiting for the troops to come ,
ah , over there , a builder of the surrounding walls sabotaged transportation by pushing over his surrounding walls .
it was built during the day , and at night , overnight militiamen shoveled it over .
the task of the 72nd regiment was , er , this destruction battle .
this destruction battle went on for a day and a night . each day the general situation was different .
-lsb- -lsb- they attacked small bridges and small districts , and generally looted these stations . -rsb- -rsb-
they carried away the iron , the iron rails of the railway , er to make steel .
er , for wood materials , local folks simply destroyed them by fire .
in this way , they fought the battle while at the same time destroying roads , stripping the entire 60 - li - long railway from xingtai to neiqiu within just a few days .
in this way , a blockade line of steel regarded as a lifeline by the japanese army was paralyzed .
it was a very tough battle . the enemy attacked several times , and each time they were repelled . there were extremely heavy casualties .
overseas japanese in yangquan city were all mobilized to participate in the battle , including children of 15 to 16 years of age .
they wanted to have , overseas compatriots get together so that they could support one another in wiping out the eighth route army and foiling our movement to destroy roads .
the hundred regiments offensive lasted three and a half months and involved two major offensive phrases and one anti-sweep phase . during the first phase from august 20 to september 10 , 1940 , a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the zhengtai , tongpu , pinghai , and jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the zhengtai railway .
during the second phase from september 22 to early october , the mission was to continue expanding battle achievements , to destroy the flanks of transportation lines , and to penetrate puppet strongholds in anti-japanese bases .
during the third phrase from october 6 to december 4 , the main task was to counterattack a retaliatory sweep by the japanese army and puppet army .
the eighth route army smashed successive large - scale sweep operations launched by the japanese army and puppet army against anti-japanese bases in taihang , taiyue , pingxi , beiyue , and northwest areas of shanxi , among others .
to those who have never experienced wars , wars are vivid stories . to those who have experienced wars , war is the course of life , part of life .
there are ,
at that time , the hundred regiments offensive greatly encouraged the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians , with news of fighting spreading rapidly throughout the taihang mountain area .
few of the veterans who participated in the hundred regiments offensive are still alive . when they speak of the hundred regiments offensive , they are always so excited .
everyone has their own memory , has the hundred regiments offensive as their own memory .
; er , i got five bullets . i carried these five bullets with me in my pocket . i took them out for a look every day . hey , this was my life .
hey , this was my life . i could not lose them . the squad leader said , at the time when you are given a rifle , you need to shoot . i will watch .
if you fail to shoot the enemy , i will punish you when you come back . do you know lice ?
they bite . how do you scald them ?
hey , well , you boil some water and get something like gunpowder . then you loosen your pants and sprinkle it . clench it like this .
then , you shake it , and you hear a cracking sound on the ground ; hey , scalded lice .
a washbasin was also very precious . how was the washbasin used ? you used the washbasin to wash your feet , used the washbasin to hold your meal , used the washbasin to wash your face , and sometimes used the same washbasin to boil water .
so , this washbasin was a precious washbasin . this photo taken back then by eighth route army field correspondent xu xiaobing is a snapshot of peng dehuai directing the campaign at the frontline of the hundred regiments offensive .
just as mao zedong once praised : who dares wield his sword and make his horse rear ? only our great general peng .
correspondent xu xiaobing , covering frontline news at the time , snapped the shutter while artillery fire roared overhead .
more than 60 years later , xu xiaobing still vividly remembers the scene at that time .
dehuai was sitting in this trench directing the campaign .
oh .
bullets and artillery fire whistled past his head .
during the three and a half months from august 20 to december 5 , 1940 , the eighth route army fought a total of 1,824 battles large and small .
a total of 46,480 japanese soldiers and puppet soldiers were killed , wounded , or captured , or defected .
four hundred seventy - four kilometers of railroad and 1,502 kilometers of highway were destroyed .
in addition , large quantities of other military supplies were seized or destroyed .
after the eighth route army launched the hundred regiments offensive , newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in north china to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories .
telegrams and letters of congratulation arrived in yan'an from all directions .
mao zedong was deeply moved . this leader with a strong poetic temperament expressed his joy in this kind of telegram . the hundred regiments offensive caused great excitement .
can such kind of campaign be organized once or twice more ? in a congratulatory telegram to zhu de and peng dehuai , chiang kai - shek praised the eighth route army 's resolute attacks for dealing a heavy blow to the enemy .
by pinning down large numbers of japanese soldiers on battlefields behind enemy lines in north china , the hundred regiments offensive delayed the japanese army 's aggression southward .
in addition , the hundred regiments offensive was a response to the european battlefield , while enhancing the international reputation of the cpc and the eighth route army .
the hundred regiments offensive wrote a glorious page in the history of china 's war of resistance against japan .
on june 30 , 1987 , the monument to the hundred regiments offensive was erected on shi'nao mountain in yangquan , shanxi , where the heroes had fought the battle .
in 1993 , six villagers in honghecao village set up the hundred regiments offensive museum at the place of nie rongzhen 's operational command .
old li jingtang still tells visitors old war stories circulating in the taihong mountain area .
more than 60 years have passed since the hundred regiments offensive took place . taihang mountain will forever remember that great battle during the chinese people 's war of resistance against japan .
during world war ii , the two hundred thousand strong chinese expeditionary force went abroad to fight .
the burma road was the lifeline artery for china 's anti-japanese battlefields .
the tengchong battle , an annihilation of the japanese army , became a typical example for the china war area .
we respectfully invite you to watch a bloody battle fought side - by - side by china , the us , and britain 60 years ago in a joint effort to repel japanese invaders .

this is cctv focus today .
prior to the apec meeting , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi visited yasukuni shrine for the fifth time and was strongly condemned by asian nations such as china and south korea .
what kind of situation will japan find itself in at the apec summit ?
what heavy prices will japan pay for koizumi 's paying respect to the ghosts ?
focus today is coming up in a moment .
hello , dear viewers !
welcome to the live broadcast of focus today on the chinese international channel .
the apec meeting is being held these days in pusan , south korea .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi also arrived in pusan this afternoon , beginning his apec trip this time .
well , prior to this , many analysts all think that during his trip to the apec meeting in pusan , this time , junichiro koizumi may likely be isolated by various parties .
the reason is that in its persistent alignment with the us , japan has ignored its relations with other countries , especially its asian neighboring countries .
what is clearly remembered by its asian neighboring countries is that on october 17 this year , in spite of opposition , junichiro koizumi stubbornly , ah , visited yasukuni shrine for the fifth time during the four years since he took office .
well , what kind of situation will japan find itself in at the apec summit ?
what kind of impact will koizumi 's lame diplomacy produce on the international image of japan ?
these are all the topics we will be focusing on today .
we have invited to our studio professor liu jiangyong and professor jin xide , two experts on japan issues .
welcome you two to the studio to participate in our program .
well , we all know that koizumi arrived in pusan this afternoon .
in the afternoon he met with south korean president roh moo - hyun .
the two met .
well , from the information and the situation you have learned , how would you two interpret some messages sent out by their meeting this time ?
ah , first of all , i think , ah , , this time , ah , when koizumi arrived in pusan , ah , he had this in his mind .
that is , through multilateral meetings , he attempted to meet with , ah , leaders of south korea or other asian nations , uh-huh . so as to -- uh-huh . demonstrate that even though he visited yasukuni shrine , uh-huh . his relations with neighboring countries are not affected .
uh-huh .
however , actually , today president roh moo - hyun of the hosting country of the meeting , uh-huh . well , based on his meeting with koizumi , i think , actually , it shows that a series of issues such as his visit to yasukuni shrine have indeed cast a very heavy shadow over the relations between the two countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yes .
well , during this meeting , er , president roh moo - hyun clearly pointed out , ah , what did he point out ? that is , er , the visit to yasukuni shrine by japanese leaders , politicians , and statesmen , is a , , provocation , ah , to south korea .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , at the same time , he pointed out , that is , er , the issue of the prime minister 's visit to yasukuni shrine , the textbook issue , and the territorial dispute .
uh-huh .
all these must be properly resolved before the relations between the two countries can improve .
uh-huh .
well , koizumi , he also , that is to say , er , argued slyly for himself , ah , he said , er , that his visit was not to glorify the war .
uh-huh .
nor was this for anything else . it was only done to express condolences on the war dead .
uh-huh .
well , at the same time , that is , it was to express that there shall be no more war in future .
however , this was still not accepted by the south korean side .
well , after the meeting between the two sides , we were very interested in this .
that is , originally this year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between south korea and japan .
fortieth anniversary .
in addition , is n't this year the year of the south korean - japanese friendship ?
yes , yes , yes .
uh-huh .
yes , yes , the year of friendship .
uh-huh .
er , well , according to the original arrangement , that is , president roh moo - hyun should pay a visit to japan , ah , at the end of this year .
uh-huh .
however , this matter was not even talked about during this , eh , bilateral summit meeting . i think this shows that it is not going to happen .
right .
uh-huh .
some commentaries said that when koizumi went to meet with roh moo - hyun this time , it was like clutching at a straw to save his life .
eh , it means that you see , although many neighboring countries are complaining about me , my image may return to a better one after i met with roh moo - hyun .
however , based on the outcome , just as professor liu introduced , it was equivalent to going there to get criticized again . right .
well , was n't it that things went contrary to his wishes ?
uh-huh , to him .
, that is to say , to japan , to prime minister koizumi , this is a very difficult diplomatic journey .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , to be able to meet with roh moo - hyun was originally the only remedy he could count on .
uh-huh .
however , roh moo - hyun actually met with him ceremonially as a host because apec held the meeting in south korea .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but , he seized the opportunity fully to express the wish of the south korean government and people .
uh-huh .
what he meant by the wish was to stop visiting yasukuni shrine .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , contrary to koizumi 's diplomatic purpose , he not only failed to sidestep the issue of the visit , but rather exposed , this scandal to the entire world .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , from the bottom of his heart , he might feel it was even worse than not meeting at all .
uh-huh .
so , this only hope of his was also destroyed .
uh-huh .
we have just started with this topic of the meeting between president roh moo - hyun and koizumi .
well , actually , regarding , um , koizumi 's attendance at this apec summit , people are more interested in the relations between japan and its asian neighboring countries , including the kind of alliance relationship between the us and japan , and so on .
uh-huh .
yeah .
well , speaking of the relationship issue , we have noticed that during us president bush 's visit in japan , koizumi made some declaration of this position .
he said , as long as we get on good terms with the us , then it follows naturally we will have good relations with our asian neighboring countries .
well , regarding this attitude he has adopted , well , two professors , how would you look at koizumi 's diplomatic thinking ?
well , this is because he is still using the pre-cold - war diplomatic thinking after the cold war , that is , the united states is the number one superpower in the world .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
japan is the second largest economy in the world .
uh-huh .
as long as these two countries stand together , then it seems that other countries could not do anything to them .
uh-huh .
well , this is actually a very overbearing image .
uh-huh .
well , looking at the situation in asia , actually , it is exactly the other way round .
uh-huh .
that is to say , if it does not get on good terms with its asian neighboring countries , then in reality the us will become even more hard - line in its diplomacy with japan .
as for japan , to the us , it furthermore has lost some assets , diplomatic assets when making negotiations with the us .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , just recently , it 's needless for us to say , er , that japan 's relations , we can say , with its neighboring countries this year have suffered overall deterioration .
these include japan 's relations with south korea , china , and russia which are all deteriorating , well , even including its relations with the us .
in fact , , even today , we also noticed a piece of news that although at , um , the recent two - plus - two meeting , er , the us and japan again reached an intermediate report , uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh . well , today , actually the head of japan 's defense agency again mentioned to the us that it seems to feel regretful ,
why ?
uh-huh .
that is , a bit regretful .
because , according to the two - plus - two intermediate report just reached , the us military bases in japan should undergo adjustment .
however , it was met with strong opposition from the general public in japan . so it may be hard to implement .
uh-huh .
so , now the jda head came to talk with the us , saying , whether our interests can be taken into consideration again , er , in this intermediate report .
that is , between the us and japan , centering upon this intermediate report , actually the deal is again partially completed .
uh-huh .
so , such a prime minister like koizumi , who blindly follows the us as the guideline of his diplomacy , was rarely seen even during the cold war era .
uh-huh .
we know that in 1957 japan had three diplomatic principles . that is to say , it must take good care of its relations with the western countries , asian countries , and the united nations .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but now , koizumi is like a stick , let 's say , a post .
right .
it takes three points to support a plane .
yeah .
so , it turned out that they had such stuff on the surface .
well , some prime ministers before koizumi at least would still properly deal with and balance the relations with america , with the us and asia , in particular , with china , ah .
uh-huh .
well , when it comes to koizumi , he only takes good care of the relations with the us .
right .
in fact , he will surely fail to take good care of the relations with the us because if you can not win the trust of your asian neighboring countries , the us will not fully respect such a country .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the us also wants to go beyond japan to keep good relations with china , south korea , and other asian countries .
therefore , the more he follows the us , the lower will be his actual status in asia .
uh-huh .
it is impossible .
right , his idea was actually criticized and opposed by some politicians even in japan . he was strongly criticized and increasingly isolated .
ah .
the domestic economy was also affected .
many people also mentioned , by valuing the us alone , you are ignoring asia . yes . now many media all issued statements and editorials .
therefore , some people also compared this diplomacy of his to a lame diplomacy .
yeah .
he -- could he walk steadily with a lame diplomacy ?
eh , as far as koizumi himself is concerned , what is his problem ?
uh-huh .
he himself , ah , er , what should we say ? he does not respect and acknowledge reality .
actually , some people say he is deceiving himself as well as others .
uh-huh . for instance , this time at the apec meeting in pusan , when he mentioned , er , japan 's relations with china , he still used this kind of , that is to say , rhetoric , to defend himself .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
he said , er , , ah , right now , japan - china relations are not like , er , what the international community is worried about .
uh-huh .
well , the economic trade development in our two countries is going on quite well .
in fact , we can say he does not understand the current status of sino - japanese relations .
uh-huh .
actually , due to his visit to yasukuni shrine and the cooling down of the political relationship , sino - japanese relations have suffered severe blows .
he is only indulging in his unilateral wishful thinking .
it is only what he thinks .
uh-huh .
we can see some concrete figures . for instance , from january to august this year , the latest statistics show that japan 's exports to china grew only by 3.2 % according to china 's statistics .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it grew only by 5.8 % according to japan 's statistics .
uh-huh .
well , in previous years , it was always more than 25 % . in other words , japan 's exports to china were declining sharply .
more than 25 % .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , at the same time , with respect to japan 's investment in china , during the first half of last year , japan 's investment projects in china decreased by 8.2 % while the contractual amount decreased by 0.4 % .
they both showed that due to the cooling down of the political relationship , well , the economic relations between china and japan have already been severely affected .
uh-huh .
uh-huh . in addition , there has also been the impact on the feelings of peoples of the two countries .
yeah .
originally , koizumi 's key fallacy for his visits to yasukuni shrine was that my visits would not affect in any way our relations with asia . uh-huh . it is not like that in reality .
uh-huh .
well , when koizumi visits yasukuni shrine , he is betting on the national interests of japan .
that is to say , he is selling the international image and national interests of japan at cheap prices .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so this is being paid at a heavy price .
uh-huh .
many japanese people also see that this does not conform to japan 's own fundamental interests , ah , as a country with so many international , um , interests .
interests .
with national interests .
at the same time , it also actually denigrates japan 's image .
uh-huh .
well , with regard to koizumi 's diplomatic thinking , there is still , that is , one question . ah , people may also frequently ask such a question that since it is the most important thing for a country to keep good relationship with its neighboring countries , why would japan want to seek far and wide for what lies close at hand ?
right .
out of what consideration is he doing this ?
well , um , this prime minister koizumi , ah , first of all , personally , he is an individual with a kind of belief , a very rightist political belief .
well , it also precisely reflects a current political trend of forces surrounding the koizumi administration .
uh-huh .
it also reflects that nowadays japan , in its eagerness to become a political power , well , wants to take advantage of the sentiments of extreme nationalism to move toward and realize this goal .
for instance , they have , a kind of wrong doing . that is to say , if japan wants to become a powerful country commanding true respect , it must get rid of the name of a defeated country , the name of an aggressor country in world war ii .
uh-huh .
so , they chose a very dangerous road .
uh-huh .
that is to say , it tries to become a decent country by negating its history as an aggressor . this is exactly a road that leads nowhere .
uh-huh .
well , this road he takes will surely isolate japan from the international community and will definitely not make it a political power in the end .
uh-huh .
well , he chose the wrong road .
ah , in addition , from his point of view , he is counting on his luck to a large extent . we can also say that some think tank people around him may have given him the wrong idea .
perhaps he was misled , wow .
ah .
for example , regarding his visits to yasukuni shrine , , he says , if i , keep doing it like this , china , south korea , ah , , that is to say , you will , grow tired of protesting .
once you see a lot of it , you will get used to it .
so , you will swallow the bitterness while i keep doing like this .
uh-huh .
however , it turns out to be exactly the opposite . he did not know this issue could bring big trouble to japan . he did not know the seriousness of the issue .
, this is an issue of principle .
right .
well , we can say that an overall review of the current diplomatic status of japan should show two clear roads .
ha , one is to follow the us blindly , which is one of its very important diplomatic lines .
and we can also see the other one , that is , to continue damaging the relations with its close neighbors well , speaking of this , we can also figure out that koizumi has seriously damaged the feelings of his asian neighboring countries several times since he took office as japan 's prime minister in 2001 .
we compiled a background video clip here , and let 's learn about some relevant information together .
in february 2005 , just one day after chinese people 's traditional spring festival , the japanese government claimed the lighthouse set on diaoyu island by japan 's extreme rightist group without permission as its national property and put in under the administration of japan .
on march 16 , 2005 , japan 's shimane prefecture assembly voted to pass a measure bill concerning takeshima day and officially designated february 22 as takeshima day . as a result , this small island just a bit over 90 kilometers from utsuryo island , south korea , again triggered a diplomatic conflict between the two countries .
south korea thinks that this island called dokdo island has always been a korean territory .
on april 1 , 2005 , the japanese ministry of education approved a new edition of history textbooks compiled by the new history textbook compilation committee and published by fusosha publishing house and announced the result officially on april 5 .
there are very few amendments in the new edition of japanese history textbooks . the parts of the old version that twisted the history and denied its crime of aggression remained unchanged . instead the japanese claims of sovereignty of south korea 's dokdo island and china 's diaoyu island were added .
with regard to the yasukuni shrine where class a ww ii criminals are honored , in spite of opposition from all sides , koizumi persistently paid a series of five visits there from 2001 to 2005 .
koizumi has been in office for , four years .
well , during these four years , we can say , er , nothing has been much improved , whether in internal affairs or diplomacy .
originally , koizumi , ah , took office because he won a very high support rating as a reformer .
eh , at that time , he pledged to reform japan 's internal political and economic situations .
however , based on the current status of internal affairs , his reform , ah , did not result , er , in what was expected at that time .
in the diplomatic field , there has been constant friction with neighboring countries .
so , right now , another important question is how exactly people in japan view koizumi 's diplomatic or internal policies , professor jin ?
well , this is , let 's say that japanese people now have finally started to cool down in their attitude toward , this kind of impulsive actions .
uh-huh .
well , we know that among major japanese newspapers , that is , the most dominant newspapers expressing popular opinions , ranging from asahi shimbun to tokyo shimbun , etc , well , recently , even yomiuri simbun , which originally expressed support for koizumi 's right - wing tendencies , has started to change sides .
uh-huh .
that is to say , their tones might be different , but the consensus of japanese public opinion is that relations with asian countries must be improved .
so , this has already become the mainstream japanese public opinion .
uh-huh . uh-huh . well , specifically , it means prohibiting visits to yasukuni shrine . this has been opposed by the liberal democratic party and all opposition parties .
well , we know that the most important pillar in japan that supports the japanese society is the japanese business community .
well , the heads of several groups in the business community , for instance , the japan business federation and the japan committee for economic development , all had frequent direct meetings with koizumi , strongly cautioning him not to visit yasukuni shrine , uh-huh . uh-huh . because our economy will suffer if our japan can not survive in the international community .
uh-huh .
as a result , nowadays , koizumi should be utterly isolated not only internationally but also domestically .
uh-huh .
right .
well , to japanese people , what they are more concerned with is , for example , how my economy is developing , how my life will be , whether the national interests will be damaged , whether my personal interests will be affected , and so on and so forth .
well , we have noticed that in response to such questions , some analysts recently noted that japan 's diplomacy will pay a heavy price for what he has been doing .
as a matter of fact , professor liu , you also mentioned earlier that japan 's economy , for instance , the sino - japanese trade , has already been affected to some extent . well , have they started to pay the price already ?
well , i think , actually , as far as japan itself is concerned , it still made some mistakes by itself . for instance , actually koizumi won an overwhelming victory in the general election held on september 11 this year . at the same time his power to form the cabinet was further strengthened .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
er , he himself thought , er , that he was probably , , er , 200 % correct in what he has been doing .
uh-huh .
however , in his diplomatic efforts , in terms of relations with neighboring countries , well , , we can say that he indeed failed miserably .
uh-huh .
well , this itself also failed to meet japan 's own demand for economic development and the trend of strengthening economic and trade relations with foreign countries , in particular , the eastern asian region , well , so as to bring about economic cooperation in this region .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , looking at japan 's economy , we should say it is currently recovering its growth .
well , externally , it mainly relies on the us and chinese markets .
uh-huh .
however , if the chinese market suffers from economic cool - down as political coldness takes heat off economic development , it should produce a very negative effect on japan 's economy .
uh-huh .
this effect may not show until probably next year .
uh-huh .
well , just now , that is to say , it was the political coldness that totally damaged its relations with neighboring countries .
uh-huh .
then , in terms of economy , he has also been unable to keep the economic heat on .
uh-huh .
well , we know , what all of us should be more concerned is his failure in international affairs .
that is , this year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the united nations .
uh-huh .
japan placed its hope of becoming a permanent member of the security council this year .
uh-huh .
well , generally speaking , if it could n't get accepted this year , well , the chances in future are extremely slim .
uh-huh .
well , among many reasons that blocked japan from getting accepted this year , the most important one was that its neighboring countries did not cast favorable votes .
that is , it did not --
it failed to gain the support of countries in its own region .
right .
to become a permanent member of the security council , the most important thing is to first win the support of your own region .
right .
well , right now it is its neighboring countries that did not support it .
uh-huh .
therefore , we should say that it is , right , this prime minister koizumi who has single - handedly ruined japan 's dream of becoming a permanent member of the security council .
uh-huh .
this is the most serious cost .
some analysts also mentioned this point , that is to say , right now , japan 's neighboring countries are basically very much disappointed with what koizumi has been doing .
well , many countries have all abandoned their hopes to further mend their relations with japan .
in this respect , such a question follows , that is , how far could koizumi go following his diplomatic policy ?
well , from what can be seen now , that is , actually , er , let 's say , from the cabinet he formed after his victory of the general election for the second time , we could indeed see that he has gathered , um , the statesmen , or politicians who approve visits to yasukuni shrine , uh-huh . all into the cabinet , everyone of them , eh .
he , right , appointed them as defense minister or foreign minister .
uh-huh .
in fact we can see that he is sort of determined on this issue to fight against neighboring countries to the end .
uh-huh .
this way , he actually sent out a message that he has no sincerity in , during his term , improving the relations with neighboring countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
this will indeed lead to the great disappointment of neighboring countries in him , and furthermore to their caution about whether next , the prime minister , the defense minister , including , er , the foreign minister would all go pay their respects at yasukuni shrine .
if that is the case , it may have produced a very extensive negative impact on its relations with neighboring countries .
uh-huh .
well , actually , right now even the european and us media have noted this issue .
right .
we , including us president bush , who came to pusan following his visit to japan this time and then will arrive again in china , are , in fact , also very concerned with this future development of sino - japanese relations .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is because i recently met an american scholar whose first question to me was whether there will be any conflict in the east china sea region .
uh-huh .
ah , i do n't think it would be that serious , but we can see that the international community has already shown tremendous concern about the chaos to international relations in this region that may have resulted from the koizumi cabinet 's reckless diplomacy .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
in fact it is not merely an issue of sino - japanese relations or japanese - korean relations .
it has triggered that --
yeah .
the nerves of the international community .
yeah .
that is , the us public and scholars have , started to show concerns over the issue of right and wrong in ww ii , the moral issue , that is , the us has started to pay attention to this issue . the us has kept quiet on the issue of yasukuni shrine because it wants to get along with everyone . uh-huh . uh-huh .
so , it has been an onlooker to the fighting among eastern asian countries .
but now the us can no longer sit quietly any more .
i think that if things go on like this , the us interests in this region are also going to suffer .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , now let 's look at this koizumi , that is , the post-koizumi era . what are his standards for selecting his successor ? is visiting yasukuni shrine a criterion ?
uh-huh .
yeah .
this is one of the important indexes that , we should watch for regarding which road exactly japan will take .
however , based on the selection and formation of his , er , cabinet , it seems that koizumi is making his post-resignation arrangements , ah . he has started to get ready .
the koizumi era , well --
has already prepared --
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , following that , for instance , if his successor is indeed shinzo abe , well , what will it mean if shinzo abe takes office ?
well , actually , i see , ah , koizumi has dual purposes in arranging this cabinet , ah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is , in fact , i now feel that he , er , is somewhat adopting a china policy that separates politics from economy .
uh-huh .
well , in politics , he will go against you , eh , mainly on the issues of yasukuni shrine and textbooks , but in economic and trade affairs , er , he still wants to safeguard japan 's economic rights .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
he is using some , eh , people who are , for instance , er , relatively moderate and pragmatic toward china .
right .
right , right , right . , for instance , a politician quite friendly with china , that is , toshihiro nikai , um , was appointed as minister of economy , trade and industry .
uh-huh .
toshihiro nikai .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , we also see that after nikai took office , his speech on the eastern china sea issue , we should say , is quite appropriate .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
ah , in his opinion , he wants to have friendly negotiations , ah , with china if he sees that china , er , has taken any action .
he does not think japan 's unilateral action in this disputed area is friendly negotiation .
uh-huh .
if it is impossible for talks to go on , it can still be postponed till future , en , when there is a chance to resume talks .
er , i think that to prevent the bilateral relations from suffering friction over specific issues , his attitude like this should be --
uh-huh .
but , can his diplomacy featuring two separate political and economic lines work ?
eh , we need to watch for it this year .
uh-huh .
well , now koizumi is constantly sending out the message that he will step down voluntarily in september next year .
well , of course we could not believe completely 100 percent of what he said about this , because it is not certain whether they will make accommodations to let koizumi stay in office .
but , if he steps down in september next year , we will see who on this cabinet will be the prime minister .
uh-huh .
well , mainly we will see whether he gives priority to diplomacy or internal affairs and whether he is more a hawk or a dove .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
we know there are several other people , such as sadakazu tanigaki and other economic figures , and those people mentioned by professor liu just now like toshihiro nikai .
uh-huh .
this koizumi has made some preparations after all , that is , he made dual preparations .
uh-huh .
so , we still have to urge this japanese government , ah , not to continue isolating itself like this .
we are certainly willing to watch for this , and will continue to monitor japan . all right .
for our final topic , let 's go back to the apec meeting this time .
uh-huh .
well , as we mentioned earlier at the beginning , eh , a very important purpose for koizumi to go to attend the apec leaders ' summit in pusan this time is to see if he could try to improve the relations with neighboring countries through talks with president roh moo - hyun , as if he were clutching at a life - saving straw .
but , could you analyze and predict what kind of achievements he can make during his trip to pusan ?
well , i think that actually the greatest achievement for him is that he should see facts .
what kind of facts ? that is , the issue of right and wrong .
well , some people say that as china 's economy is growing , japan is getting somewhat jealous .
er , as two powers are juxtaposed , the relations between the two countries have become somewhat tense .
in reality it is not necessary so . for instance , china 's economy is growing , eh , and getting stronger , but we see the relations between china and south korea are indeed developing rapidly .
uh-huh .
well , the current trade between china and south korea has reached nearly 100 billion us dollars .
uh-huh .
er , within another period of time , er , that is , by 2012 when it is , the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and south korea , 200 billion us dollars ' worth of economic trade can be reached .
yeah .
so , this will have surpassed what it is now for japan and china which still failed to reach 200 billion us dollars at this 33rd anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations .
uh-huh .
we can say , the economic development in south korea and china , to borrow roh moo - hyun 's words , is developing rapidly .
uh-huh .
in addition , we can see that south korea has been improving its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of japan .
uh-huh .
china has also significantly improved its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of japan .
uh-huh .
it is the same with russia .
yeah .
we , should say that people in the world are very clear about what is right and wrong .
it is all in the hearts of people .
yeah .
i think this can only prove koizumi 's stubbornness .
i do n't think it is certain at this point that he will change suddenly and completely .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is to say , this time he could only further expose his poor diplomatic skills and his isolation to the international community .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , based on his past remarks and deeds , it is hard to determine whether he will suddenly change his diplomatic policy after he returns .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , there is very little chance in this regard .
er , judging from the situation he is in while participating in the apec meeting , er , i am afraid he may not be suffering from friction with neighboring countries only .
apart from that , er , some sources disclosed , for instance , he has also had some problems on this issue with some latin american countries .
yes .
so , just as we mentioned at the start of the program , during his trip to pusan , koizumi must feel not only isolated but also surely frustrated .
uh-huh . all right .

hello , dear viewers .
welcome to focus today . after repeatedly postponing his trip to japan , russian president putin finally arrived at japan 's haneda airport on november 20 , beginning a three - day visit to japan .
it can be said that the four northern islands issue is always an obstacle that putin can not sidestep while visiting japan .
heading a russian business delegation of more than one hundred people this time , putin wants to improve bilateral relations through promoting economic development .
well , how will the four northern islands issue dead knot be untied ? and will economic and trade exchange between russia and japan be hampered because of this ?
these are all topics we will be focusing on today . two experts have been invited to our studio . let me briefly introduce , one is mr. jin xide , an expert on japanese issues from the academy of social sciences .
hello !
the other one is mr. xing guangcheng , an expert on russian issues from the academy of social sciences .
hello !
welcome to the two experts , for coming to the studio for our interview .
well , at the beginning of the program , let 's learn about the situation in japan .
let 's now connect via telephone with mr. wang xinsheng , an expert on japanese issues from beijing university who is currently visiting japan .
hello , professor wang .
ah , hello , host !
first , please brief us on what was discussed during today 's talks between the russian and japanese leaders . was the four northern islands issue touched upon ?
eh , well , president putin and prime minister koizumi , ah , the two talked for a total of two and a half hours and signed a total of 12 documents . it should be said that quite a large number of documents were signed .
however , the general reaction from scholars , media , or ordinary people here , er , is rather low key , because , er , there has been no progress on the two issues that japan is relatively concerned with , the northern territories issue , er , and the oil pipeline route issue .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
regarding the northern territories issue , , er , president putin purposely avoided this issue , that is , he did not really want to talk about it .
uh-huh .
well , in fact , it can be said that there has still been no progress on territorial issues .
uh-huh .
so the two sides abandoned plans for a joint declaration .
well , on the oil pipeline route issue , though the russian side promised to connect it with japan , there was no talk about prioritizing a connection with japan .
the media here is concerned because russia already promised to prioritize connecting it with china , er , , so the media here is concerned that it is an empty promise .
in this way , japan may not get , er , any material benefit , while the russian side will have gained japan 's support for its wto accession .
er , in addition , at the business federation meeting , russian president putin urged the japanese business community to invest in russia .
however , due to the territorial issues , or little progress on the territorial issues , along with the business community 's concerns with the investment environment in russia , well , it remains a big question how far economic cooperation can go .
uh-huh .
host .
this was the main content of the two leaders ' talks today .
well , what kind of response did people in japan have to , well , some of the achievements this trip to japan has made ?
er , it is still rather , er , low key .
, that is to say , ah , er , we also saw , er , in tokyo , some right - wing groups held demonstrations , demanding that russia , return the four northern islands .
well , they are also extremely dissatisfied because no progress has been made on this issue .
well , both the media and citizens have such concerns , that is to say , they are afraid that resolution of territorial issues may take rather .
host .
okay , thank you very much , professor wang , for briefing us on the relevant information in japan . thank you !
well , next we will return to the studio to interview the two experts in the studio . just now , this professor wang talked about putin 's visit to japan this time .
although the two sides signed 12 agreements , it seems that japan is not very satisfied with the content of the agreements , ah , in terms of the content , because it seems that neither of the two issues that japan wanted greatly to talk about , the four northern islands issue and the oil pipeline issue , made the achievements they had anticipated .
well , was this within the expectations of you two experts ?
right , this is rather consistent with unanimous international public opinion analysis as well as our opinion these days .
uh-huh .
well , , this discussion , it was a meeting of the leaders of both sides , which by itself is an achievement .
uh-huh .
as we know , putin has kept putting off this visit to japan since last year , like back then when yeltsin repeatedly postponed his trip to japan .
that is to say , japan asked for too high a price .
that is , it asked the russian president to come to japan to make concessions on territorial issues .
well , , well , the russian president , was unwilling to make concessions .
therefore , the itinerary was not decided for a long time .
well , russia 's attitude was that it would not talk about territorial issues if it went .
well , , from the perspective of japan , without discussion of territorial issues , the talks were viewed as making no progress .
for japanese citizens , this was meaningless .
uh-huh . it only provided koizumi with a diplomatic stage . what method does he want to use to remedy the lethargic post-apec diplomatic situation ? well , what russia actually wants is economic cooperation with japan ,
uh-huh .
including the development of oil resources in eastern siberia , and , um , some other investment and trade .
well , japan is still like this , saying first return the territories , then we can talk about economics .
well , , based on the outcome this time , i think this basic structure remains unchanged .
uh-huh .
er , director xing , it can be said that this time one of the very important purposes of president putin 's visit to japan is to facilitate the progress of bilateral relations through economic development .
but from what our professor wang has just introduced , do you think putin has achieved his aim ?
eh , he should be said to have achieved his aim .
uh-huh .
the visit to japan was in itself one of putin 's important aims .
uh-huh .
because with large preconditions having been set , and now the framework having being set , it is impossible for putin , that is to say , to make major breakthroughs on the substantive issues of russian - japanese relations .
uh-huh .
well , as two neighboring nations , ah , relations between them should be developed , development of relations should be further promoted . there should be exchanges back and forth , which would not work if putin , refuses to come .
so , well , , how did he come to japan ?
as mentioned earlier , ah , it had been postponed again and again , but by way of this kind of opportunity , well , putin 's visit to japan was smoothly accomplished .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
as to what kind of result you want , that is another matter .
right .
but making the trip was significant in itself .
what was the significance ?
it was that russia sent a very important message , that is , russia is willing to develop relations with japan . we sincerely have such a wish . a wish is the start of achieving results .
we have such a start . both leaders saved a bit of face .
right , right , right , in addition to giving face to each other . also , on the surface we saw it looked fine , with , 12 documents signed as just mentioned .
they both gave face .
right .
it is another matter if you care about the size of the documents . but they were signed .
uh-huh .
well , can we interpret it this way ?
based on the briefing given by you two experts , both japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and russian president putin , they both achieved their own aims in form and , er , obtained what they wanted through this visit .
on this point , their two fates are connected .
uh-huh .
that is to say , both sides have strong nationalist sentiments domestically and powerful parliaments . well , i think at this point it would be ludicrous for putin to concede on the territorial issues .
uh-huh .
well , as you should know , it is entirely , impossible behavior .
right .
well , it seems it may also be very difficult for koizumi now , that is to say , on the territorial issues , to return to what is called , er , economics first , territories second , or , the separation of politics and economics , or two islands first , then two islands later .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , recently , that is , , new foreign minister aso proposed a theory of joint development , that is , to postpone -lsb- -lsb- the issue of sovereignty of the northern -rsb- -rsb- and to jointly develop the , , four islands .
well , in fact the theory of joint development was originally proposed by russia . well , in the past , for instance , in 1996 , primakov also proposed it when he was foreign minister .
it had been raised prior to that too , but japan did not accept it at that time .
well , why did taro aso recently again propose , er , such a suggestion ?
well , i checked some data , ah . japan 's recent reaction is not japan 's mainstream domestic opinion .
uh-huh .
well , domestic political circles in japan all opposed this suggestion by taro aso .
uh-huh .
they said that with joint development , russia would advocate adopting the current russian controlled situation , the current situation , and applying russian law . well , by making investments there , in fact , well , it would be equivalent to permanent recognition that the four islands are russia 's .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so this theory of joint development will not be able to make progress either . so under the current situation , the meeting of the two leaders itself was the greatest achievement this time . the rest did not have any substantive significance . right .
uh-huh .
i 'd like to add a few words .
regarding the joint development he talked about , russia is also very interesting . , the japanese proposed it , now russia instead rejected it . it rejected it , its government stated very clearly , we can not jointly develop the four northern islands . this is a very interesting issue .
right .
they dropped it .
right .
what do you say about this ?
er , , , , it , also has its vigilance .
well , this also has a lot to do with russia 's strategy of building a powerful nation .
russia now , it has independently formulated a strategic vision of developing the far east and siberian regions . it has such a vision .
uh-huh .
the four northern islands are included in this grand vision .
right .
today , among our topics , the four northern islands can be said to be the core topic .
we can discuss this issue again in detail at the end .
well , before this , we have one more question , that is , er , regarding the issue of this russian president putin 's repeated postponement of his visit to japan ,
well , many viewers may have some questions on this issue .
well , we happen to have a background video clip here .
let 's gain some understanding through this background video clip . why did russian president putin visit japan again after , an interval of five years , after quite a few twists and turns ?
it can be said that putin 's visit to japan after an interval of five years was realized following quite a few twists and turns .
the visit was first scheduled for the second half of 2004 . the japanese side hoped that after winning the presidential election in march of that year , putin could personally intervene in the territorial issues existing between japan and russia for a long time .
however , by may , the russian side said it could not provide measures for resolving the territorial issues , and putin 's visit to japan was pushed to the spring of 2005 .
while japan expressed helplessness to this , it hoped putin could visit in february as it was the 150th anniversary of the signing of a trade and border treaty between japan and russia .
however , putin responded only with a congratulatory telegram , with no mention of his visit to japan .
on september 2 , 2004 , koizumi went by boat to tour the four northern islands . this move at once infuriated russia . accordingly , the date of putin 's visit to japan turned into a variable which nobody could explain .
in various versions , some said putin would visit japan in april 2005 , some said may , while others said june .
in russia 's diplomatic circles , there were even widespread rumors , including that putin would not visit japan within the year and that russia 's ambassador to japan would soon be removed .
various speculation existed until may 2005 , at the celebration of the 60th anniversary of victory in the world 's anti-fascist war .
under pressure from various sides , koizumi reluctantly attended this celebration . furthermore , precisely because of this , putin 's visit to japan was basically confirmed .
this time , on this visit , er , between russia and japan , ah , er , as far as japan was concerned , it really hoped that russian president putin would talk about the four northern islands issue during his visit .
however , russia 's thinking was , er , we want to develop the economy first .
there should be economic cooperation before we can talk about the four northern islands issue , which means that currently the two sides both insist on a condition from the other side .
well , in this way , the conflict would become more conspicuous during the talks .
well , was this also the reason that caused russian president putin , in spite of " the two being close neighbors " these five years , to visit japan again only after , an interval of five years ?
, this is not just during putin 's tenure , that is , it has been like this for the 60 years after the war .
uh-huh .
that is , whether there should be a separation of politics and economics or not . that is , whether it should be economic cooperation first or resolution of political issues first .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , this eased for a period after the cold war during the gorbachev era .
uh-huh .
that is , gorbachev recognized the four islands issue between japan and russia .
there was nothing like this in the past . in the past , only the issue of two islands was recognized .
well , there was once an opportunity for this , but japan again did not seize it .
uh-huh .
russia has changed a lot as well .
well , later , that is , after several changes , for instance , during hashimoto ryutaro 's term , ah , russia proposed separating politics from economics , to make progress on both at the same time .
uh-huh .
however , when it came to the critical moment , that is , on the territorial issues , perhaps due to japan 's domestic nationalist sentiments and the sensitivity of the territorial issues , it was impossible for any prime minister to claim for two islands only .
uh-huh .
when talks on the two islands came to a final decision , the japanese prime minister retreated again to the point that politics and economics could not be separated and that political issues should still be resolved first .
uh-huh .
well , in addition , the russian president was exactly the opposite , that is , denying at critical moments that there were territorial issues , that is , sometimes even the issue of the two islands .
uh-huh .
that is , it was impossible to give the territories to japan .
so , this shows how difficult it is to resolve japanese - russian relations .
uh-huh .
i think in the near future , er , the possibility of breakthrough progress is also , very small .
eh , we all know japan is the second largest economy in the world .
furthermore , japan is also a very important investor overseas .
however , a set of data shows that japanese investment in russia accounts for only 1 % of its investments overseas , that is , just over 700 million us dollars .
well , as russia should be said to badly need japanese funds , as well as badly needing japanese economic cooperation , well , how urgent do you think russia 's need is ?
i think the time of russia 's most urgent need is already over . uh-huh . the most urgent time was still the 1990s .
at that time , russia was indeed pressing for japanese investment .
uh-huh .
because russia was in a deep degree of overall crisis .
uh-huh . it was like a very thirsty man who needs to drink water . at such time , he , needs someone else to give him a cup of water .
uh-huh .
well , now , the economic crisis in russia is essentially over .
well , under such circumstances , russia , er , it can make diplomatic arrangements calmly .
uh-huh .
therefore , i think japan , that is , again lost the best opportunity to enter the russian market .
uh-huh .
it can not be said to have lost it forever . in other words , that time was the best , a relatively good period .
uh-huh .
why should we say that ?
that is to say , at that time if japan had made a very good investment in russia , well , japan , in terms of russia 's economy , it could have helped russia 's economic recovery .
uh-huh .
well , currently japan is very important to russia again .
well , as a neighboring nation , especially as japan is a world economic power , russia really needs japanese investment , now not japanese aid , but its investment .
uh-huh . it can also be said it is this way strategically .
putin 's current strategy is to build a powerful nation , a strategy for making his country powerful and his people rich .
uh-huh .
well , this strategy is extremely clear .
he used an expression , saying that russia 's diplomacy is economic diplomacy .
all , diplomatic activities must promote russia 's prosperity , eh , development , and wealth and power .
uh-huh .
well , seen from this perspective , well , japan is very important to russia .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
therefore , just now you mentioned some figures regarding russian - japanese relations , that is , economic and trade relations , for such a large , such a powerful economy as japan , well , it invested only 700-plus million in russia .
this is extremely small . uh-huh . said it will be ten billion .
well , last year 's trade volume was perhaps more than 9 billion .
this year , , koizumi said it may exceed 100 trillion . this is a very small figure in terms of trade relations between two countries .
it has nearly reached 200 billion between china and japan . so . right .
here it has a comparison .
er , between russia and japan , the trade volume only equals , of sino - japanese trade volume , one twenty - second .
uh-huh . right . it seems to be one twenty - second , or one nineteenth .
well , what does this status show ?
right , just about , eh .
i will explain two issues -- one , it may show that the economic environment in russia is indeed not very good .
uh-huh .
in general , none of the , eh , large nations in the world , have entered the russian market with much ease . uh-huh .
this is an objective factor , but there is a subjective factor too .
that is to say , it is not that japan does not need the russian market .
perhaps some non-economic factor is playing a role . it has always been the territorial issue . well , as we said , this kind of nationalist sentiment plays a great role here .
so one very important aim of putin 's visit this time , which i also think is very clever , is to put aside some very sensitive old territorial topics .
this topic is hard to tackle . uh-huh .
however , he can promote the development of economic relations , as economics is a dynamic factor .
uh-huh .
putin came this time bringing more than 100 people , such a large delegation , to japan . he still intends to solicit businesses and investment , to use our chinese expression , yet this intention is very obvious .
right , right .
right , i think .
however , based on this outcome , the form still seems to have outdone the content .
i think that with regard to japan 's relations with russia , it has been like this since the 1970s .
when tanaka kakuei went there , he also did this .
i will invest , i will give you aid to develop eastern siberia . that 's because russia has a vast area of land .
we know the population is small , that is to say they can not develop it .
that is , the treasure is all hidden underground .
well , at that time , , they still wanted to solve the population problem .
uh-huh . so , that is , japan used economics for political purposes . uh-huh .
well , now it seems that koizumi has still not changed this course .
uh-huh . well , this way , i do n't think this dead knot can be untied .
also , if things continue like this , increasing the nations ' mutual trust can never be realized .
yes , , eh , just now director xing mentioned a very important issue , that is , the nationalist sentiment .
in fact , regarding putin 's visit to japan this time , the media earlier predicted , among other things , that when the time came , there would be more than 60 groups totaling more than 700 people , along with , hey , more than 200 propaganda trucks on the streets of downtown tokyo , to protest against putin 's visit to japan .
well , what forces do these people and groups holding street protests represent ? what are they asking for ? and what impact will it have on putin 's visit to japan ? okay .
they are some focused right - wing groups , similar to a gang society .
but , with regard to this russian issue , ah , this can not be simply regarded as a handful of people making trouble , because there are widespread historical grievances among ordinary people in japan against russia .
i have had contact with many japanese . that is to say , this involves the origin of the northern territories issue . well , i think it originated a long time ago and involves three major issues .
one is that historically and legally , it has changed several times .
for instance , in 1855 , in 1875 , and in 1905 after the russo - japanese war , and also ww ii , at these critical points , ownership of the territories was constantly changing .
with ancestors constantly changing , both sides had their own arguments .
in fact , ownership of the northern territories has changed several times , and there has been no single law .
therefore , there is truth on both sides .
uh-huh . now russia says this was the result of wwii international laws and treaties , with the us also recognizing it at that time .
uh-huh . the entire international community recognizes that the four islands should belong to russia .
both the yalta agreement and article 2 of the san francisco treaty recognize japan 's relinquishment of the kuril islands .
however , then there is a lot of nationalist sentiment , that is , japan believes that the soviet union unilaterally broke the pact of neutrality , sending troops into northeast china and defeating the kwantung army .
for things like this , as japan looks at this piece of history -- also , japanese captives were dragged to siberia to labor camps -- i heard there were 100,000 , 200,000 .
uh-huh .
well , there is also a nationalist sentiment issue ; also , including this , these have all been brought together .
therefore , unraveling this historical feud , the northern territories issue , is not so clear - cut , since history , society , and law , as well as nationalist sentiments are all entangled together .
yeah . just now you mentioned the origin of the four northern islands . well , today we have been talking about the four northern islands issue .
well , how exactly did the four northern islands issue originate ? let 's learn something about it .
the four islands , iturup , shikotan , the khabomai rocks , and kunashir , are located in the northern part of the western pacific ocean , with a total area of about 5,000 square kilometers , which japan calls the four northern islands , and russia calls southern chishima .
their surrounding sea waters have a great wealth of fishing resources and undersea mineral deposits , with highly important strategic positions . the ownership of these four islands has long been a dead knot in russian - japanese relations that has been difficult to untie .
in august 1945 , the us dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in succession .
to ask the soviet union to declare war against japan , the us and britain gave russia the chishima islands and the southern part of sakhalin island , which japan occupied at the time .
in 1955 the soviet union and japan began negotiations regarding the normalization of relations .
the then soviet union indicated willingness to return the khabomai rocks and shikotan . yet japan requested that the soviet union return iturup and kunashiri as well .
it also requested that the soviet union promise to attend the international peace conference to determine the ownership of sakhalin and the entire chishima islands .
negotiations broke down as a result .
in 1956 , the then soviet union restated its willingness to return the khabomai rocks and shikotan .
japan again said that unless the four islands were returned together , the soviet proposal could definitely not be accepted .
for a long time , japanese - russian relations have not made breakthrough progress due to the deadlocked four northern islands issue .
today , already more than 50 years after the end of ww ii , the two nations have still not signed a peace treaty realizing the complete normalization of bilateral relations .
in the literal sense , if the two nations have not signed a peace treaty , it means at this point the two nations are still at war .
as the two experts are constantly discussing , saying that the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in japanese - russian relations , yet this dead knot , it seems that currently both sides have this idea , they want to untie this dead knot .
well , we noticed , er , just now this short clip also talked about it , at that time the soviet union agreed to return two islands first , , but , eh , japan never agreed .
but now , we also notice that , taro aso proposed a new idea , the joint development that the soviet union had previously talked about .
well , can this point lead to a breakthrough in the two nations ' resolution of the four northern islands issue ?
i think it is very hard , as joint development and sovereignty of the islands are , ah , two concepts .
it wo n't work , either , eh , eh .
but this is relevant .
uh-huh .
oh , as i just mentioned , it was against a large background that russia first proposed it .
uh-huh .
with , quite a troubled economy , russia needed japanese investment , needed japan to get involved through this channel .
uh-huh .
well , now that its economy has greatly improved , russia does not need to take this diplomatic risk . uh-huh . this is one .
second , russia should be seen as a rather strong nation .
well , this place , the four northern islands , is a very sensitive region for the russian psyche .
any small , small diplomatic or economic action will affect the psyche of russian citizens .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , well , putin 's visit to japan this time , or during his visit to japan , or prior to this , there were rallies in the far east region , including the sakhalin area , meant to give many warnings to putin . uh-huh .
well , russian politicians also made many appeals regarding this .
well , one russian politician stated very clearly that while russia 's territory is vast , russia does not have territories to spare .
this is a very , very , eh , tough kind of issue .
well , as i just said very clearly , that is to say , in addition to the legal and historical complications , the repeated change of ownership , and then national sentiments as well , the four northern islands are also strategically very important .
that is , does n't russia advocate a double - headed eagle policy ?
right , right .
it is both a european and asian nation .
well , if he wants development in asia , wo n't he close the door if he loses hold of the four northern islands now ?
uh-huh .
fisheries .
the four northern islands not only have mineral deposits , oil , and fisheries , but also for military strategy , they are key positions in the pacific ocean .
in the pacific ocean , right .
currently russia seems to be in a period of low tide , but it wo n't stay this way forever .
right , right , right .
it is still a large nation . it is still a large nation . it is also an international power . therefore , none of its leaders can easily give away the four northern islands .
, , let me again add some words , if it wants joint development , japanese companies and japanese influence will enter the four northern islands .
right , right .
well , after entering , , economic influence may lead to political influence . currently that would seem to benefit japan .
yes . it would benefit japan .
russia has foreseen the consequences .
that 's why russia now rejects it .
it was originally proposed by russia , but rejected by japan .
uh-huh .
this is a new incarnation , but with different political significance .
uh-huh . well , since the four northern islands issue is a dead knot in bilateral relations that can not be untied , and also both are working hard , yet with seemingly little hope in sight , well , how can japanese - russian relations develop under such circumstances ?
i think both sides generally know the two sides ' levels of political operations , knowing that territorial issues are hard to resolve .
so , with this issue having gone on for many years , both sides may have a bottom line .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
that is , they wo n't say we will stay opposed to each other as long as it is unresolved .
uh-huh .
so it may be like this .
that is to say , in the future both sides may become more reasonable on this issue .
that is , looking farther ahead , normalization of relations will still be gradually developed .
uh-huh .
that is , do n't always get stuck on the territorial issue .
but on the other hand , the territorial issue is also quite important and sensitive .
so it is unrealistic for you to say there will be breakthrough progress in japanese - russian relations and that their economic and trade relations will suddenly achieve 100 billion . uh-huh . uh-huh . so the prospects for japanese - russian relations are not too good .
uh-huh . that is , it will be , that is , very common , , relatively bland kind of relationship .
uh-huh .
that is , russian - japanese relations , from the perspective of russia , i do n't see many changes in the large framework of russian - japanese relations .
well , mr. xing , how do you view russian - japanese relations ?
that is to say , these basic tones have been set . the main issue is the four northern islands .
however , current signs show that russia and japan are moving forward on economic issues , on economic cooperation .
uh-huh . yes . i will give two examples .
one example is that this year toyota motor has invested in st. petersburg . uh-huh . in addition , putin attended the ribbon - cutting ceremony .
this is , quite a clear signal .
that is to say , -- japan has now invested in russia .
second , what japan hopes to get is , hey , russia 's oil .
uh-huh . though russia did not make a final commitment , there is already a general framework .
uh-huh .
that is to say , eventually russia 's oil pipeline will be connected to a pacific ocean port , which will benefit japan .
uh-huh .
that is , although there are obstacles in bilateral relations , they are still exploring forward movement .
right .
uh-huh .
okay , well , today we will end our discussion here on the topic of putin 's visit to japan .

this is cctv focus today .
a british newspaper revealed that the us had planned to bomb the al - jazeera tv station in qatar .
was this a joke told by us president bush or was it a long - meditated threat ?
did british prime minister blair know nothing about it , or did he succeed in persuading his ally to give up the idea of attacks ?
what exactly is the truth ?
why can a tv station in a small arab country have us president bush on pins and needles ?
focus today is coming up in a minute .
hello , dear viewers , welcome to focus today .
on november 22 , the british newspaper daily mirror revealed that us president bush once planned to bomb the al - jazeera tv station headquarters , setting off a mighty uproar .
the two british nationals charged with leaking the information already appeared in court for interrogation yesterday for the first time .
according to a report by the british newspaper the guardian , al - jazeera tv station is now considering suing us president bush for this matter .
well , what exactly was this incident ?
why has al - jazeera tv station become a thorn in bush 's side ?
these are all the topics we will be focusing on today .
two honorable guests have been invited to our studio .
let me give you an introduction . one is mr. ruan zongze , vice director of the china institute of international studies . mr. ruan zongze has done extensive researches on british and us issues .
the other is mr. wu huixuan , former cir chief correspondent based in qatar .
hello !
welcome you two to the studio for our interview .
well , at the start of today 's program , let 's learn about the full context of this incident together .
we will first talk about the daily mirror article that started it . what we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in britain called the daily mirror .
next , let 's see ; this is a november 22 article . the title goes like this :
exclusive report : bush planned to bomb his arab ally
well , let 's now look at the content of the article .
the article writes that the minutes of a meeting between british prime minister blair , who was visiting the us on april 16 , 2004 , and us president bush at the white house showed that bush had intended to take military actions against al - jazeera tv station headquartered in the qatari capital of doha .
then , blair said to bush that such an action would trigger a worldwide uproar .
these are some records of the conversation between the two men .
let 's now look at this article .
let 's look at this line marked with a black frame , which writes : undoubtedly bush wanted to do this .
and equally without doubt , blair did not want him , that is , bush , to do this .
well , it happened , er , that our correspondent did an interview at the al - jazeera 's beijing office today and happened to videotape the image we are watching now , which was broadcast live by al - jazeera tv station .
it was the news about bush 's plan to bomb al - jazeera tv station . so what we are seeing on screen was exactly transmitted by al - jazeera tv station .
well , yesterday the two british nationals involved in the disclosure of the incident were interrogated by the court . well , here is the scene of the two persons under interrogation .
in the meantime , al - jazeera tv station also protested several times upon learning the information .
well , this is a brief introduction of the context of the incident .
well , regarding this topic , the first question today is that we want to find out clearly whether this incident was real or not . let 's start with this newspaper .
well , director yuan , i know that you also once worked in britain .
well , what kind of newspaper is the daily mirror ?
it is said to have a very large circulation , but people still call it a tabloid . so how accurate is the news carried by it ? this is true .
its circulation should be considered one of the largest among british newspapers .
uh-huh .
but at the same time , interestingly , it is not a mainstream newspaper , either .
uh-huh .
that is why it is called a tabloid , because it does not belong to the mainstream in the current british newspaper industry .
it is still called a tabloid .
it is placed together with other city newspapers , yet it is also a newspaper of national circulation with an extremely powerful influence .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
its influence is mainly on ordinary readers , the general public .
that 's because most british newspapers have their own steady readership .
they have different levels of readership , ah .
right , they have a fairly steady readership .
right .
well , this newspaper is said to have various kinds of topics appropriate to all ages .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
well , so , now we need to seriously consider its authenticity or accuracy .
is the news carried by it credible or not ?
how much is its accuracy , i think , is still quite hard to determine at this time , indeed , uh-huh .
because i will mainly speak from two perspectives .
first , when the mirror got hold of the news , it called 10 downing street the first night , saying that it had such information .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
well , it meant to find out whether 10 downing street had anything to say , but downing street said it had no comments .
uh-huh .
however , when the news was released , it set off such a mighty uproar .
uh-huh .
this is the first point .
the second point is to look at the reaction of al - jazeera tv station . what al - jazeera tv station is now asking britain to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it . uh-huh , uh-huh . however , right now , britain has neither said it is true nor said it is not .
that is the situation .
it did not confirm anything . however , there is still one detail .
when we introduced the context information , we also mentioned the two staff members involved in the leakage of the information .
these two staff members , also considered british government employees , have already been under interrogation .
well , since they are under interrogation , it means they may have indeed divulged the secret .
could this be used to determine that there was indeed such an incident ?
there was such an incident , um , uh-huh .
i think there are two questions involved in this matter . one is whether there is any secret being divulged , and the other is whether the news that bush wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station is true .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think these are two different questions .
uh-huh .
regarding the leakage of the secret , it seems that the possibility here , ah , is really big .
what secret exactly was divulged ?
um .
because according to the british , um , government , um , its official secrets act section 5 , that is to say , it is illegal for newspapers or media to publicize indiscreetly government information obtained through unauthorized channels .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , well , these two people have already been suspected of violating this section , and that is why they have been sued .
right .
well , of course it is still in a preliminary stage right now , and yesterday a hearing lasting only 15 minutes was held .
uh-huh .
but , both of these two people denied they were guilty .
uh-huh .
so , now it will still have to go through a quite lengthy judicial procedure .
eh , in other words , although they were interrogated , whether the secret leaked was something like our topic today , that is , bush said he wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station , whether the secret divulged was this record , these are still two different things .
however , it should be closely related to this because this is about the so - called memo .
uh-huh .
it should be closely related .
yeah .
uh-huh .
on april 16 of last year when blair was visiting the us , they had some exchange between them . that was how this memo came into being . it was about five pages long .
right .
uh-huh .
well , in this memo , bush seemed to imply that he probably wanted to bomb this al - jazeera tv station .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
at that time blair tried his best to persuade him not to do it .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , but the very authenticity of the incident , i think , still needs to be determined by the british government or us government .
they need to come out for making clarification and judgment .
yeah .
well , mr. wu , we know , ah , you worked as a reporter in qatar and were very familiar with al - jazeera tv station . so how do you look at this incident ? do you think it is real or not ?
um .
i think it is possible that the us wanted to bomb al - jazeera tv station .
uh-huh .
that 's because all the things reported by al - jazeera tv station since its establishment in 1996 were those the us did not want viewers in the world to look at , especially with respect to the afghan war and iraq war .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
what they reported was entirely incompatible with the so - called freedom of the press advocated by the us .
uh-huh .
for instance , the us attacked al - jazeera tv station several times .
it happened once that when bush , er , together with that defense secretary rumsfeld visited qatar , they , put pressure on the qatari government , saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the us .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , later , under such circumstances , eh , the director of al - jazeera tv station was replaced once .
uh-huh .
under his pressure .
uh-huh .
but , the leader of al - jazeera tv station , jazeera , ah , qatar replied that we advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that our government has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private tv station .
that is to say , eh , according to your judgment , this incident was possible because the us has long considered it a thorn in its flesh .
right .
so , to say that the us government or the us president had such an idea , you think many people may easily believe it .
yeah .
there is such possibility .
right , yes .
all right , regarding whether this incident was real or not , according to you two , eh , there is indeed a lot of information . there are no waves without wind . yeah .
right , there are no waves without wind .
so , this incident probably does have some basis .
some basis .
well , let 's now focus on this al - jazeera tv station .
as a matter of fact , when we watch tv , we can see many news services , ah , including the us cnn and the british bbc , often replaying footage by al - jazeera tv station .
since the al - jazeera tv station logo is on , people should be quite familiar with al - jazeera tv station .
the station logo , right .
yeah .
but how did this al - jazeera tv station rise to fame competing with so many western media outlets in news coverage ?
let 's learn about this through another background video clip .
al - jazeera tv station , established in november 1996 in qatar , is an arabic - language news tv station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock . its staff all comes from various arab countries , and its viewership has reached 50 million .
prior to its establishment , there has been no arabic - language tv station broadcasting news nonstop around the clock in the arab world .
in september 2001 , the 9 / 11 attacks broke out in the us .
on october 7 , the us and britain launched military strikes on the taliban in afghanistan .
as a result , another news war erupted in the international media community . when people all over the world expected to watch the live broadcast of the war by the us cnn , they could only see a few blurry images on tv .
meanwhile , however , the little known al - jazeera tv station based in the small gulf country of qatar suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of the afghan war in arabic language and mobilized its 27 reporting stations all over the world to conduct an around - the - clock follow up coverage .
when the taliban regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of afghanistan , al - jazeera tv station was the only one that could enter the taliban - controlled area .
taking such an advantage , al - jazeera tv station started to establish its unique leading position in covering the afghan war with its frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the afghan capital of kabul .
during the war , al - jazeera tv station continued to broadcast exclusive news and images under its logo and sell them to competitors at the high price of 20,000 us dollars per minute .
while the us military searched everywhere for information on bin laden in vain , al - jazeera tv station frequently aired the footage of bin laden making a speech .
mr. wu , we know that you happened to be in qatar when al - jazeera tv station was just established in 1996 .
right .
in addition , you were said to have attended the inaugural broadcast ceremony .
what did al - jazeera tv station look like when it just started broadcasting ?
what kind of news broadcast style was featured at that time ?
er , they held an inaugural broadcast ceremony at the end of november 1996 at that time .
we reporters in qatar were also invited to attend this inaugural broadcast ceremony .
uh-huh .
there were n't many people at the time .
uh-huh .
but at the time of its establishment , this , er , al - jazeera tv station already had a very good foundation in terms of reporters .
uh-huh .
why ?
in 1995 , um , the british bbc 's arabic language tv station was shut down due to funding problems .
uh-huh .
so , al - jazeera tv station seized this opportunity to get hold of , this entire group of people by hiring them , er , as their reporters , editors , or anchors at high salaries .
uh-huh .
so , they had a relatively good team of reporters .
uh-huh .
well , this way , later it followed that , er , er , , , er , six - chinese - character principle of news reporting called , er , independence , neutrality , ah , neutrality , balance , and freedom .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , what it reported was in a completely different style from that of some other arab tv stations .
right .
in this respect , that is , let me add one point , that is , this al - jazeera tv station , ah , its style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the west , for instance , the two mainstream media outlets .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
uh-huh .
one is cnn , and the other is bbc .
yeah .
well , i think that bbc , in particular , has quite a big influence on it .
just now , that is to say , many of its reporters directly came from the middle east channel at that time .
uh-huh .
that was jointly run by bbc and saudi arabia . so it had a very good foundation . in addition , that is , actually , this al - jazeera tv station has a quite unique structure .
that 's because the emir of this country is called hamad .
he studied in britain and therefore had quite a good knowledge of britain 's bbc tv station .
he also quite admired it . so , in this way , it has borrowed some of the bbc style .
for instance , britain 's bbc is a very old tv group established in 1927 .
uh-huh .
though it is funded by the government with many of its properties owned by the government , it still follows the guideline of editorial independence .
uh-huh .
for instance , the top decision - making body of bbc is called the board of directors which are composed of twelve members directly appointed by the queen .
uh-huh .
so al - jazeera tv station has also adopted this structure . it has a top seven - member board of directors .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
however , even if its property , ah , and funds can come from the government , it still relatively has its editorial independence .
eh , but in essence , mr. wu , is it really a private tv station or a government - run tv station ?
er , they themselves claim that it is a private tv station , but in reality it could not have been established without a large amount of financial support given by the government .
that 's because it , eh , has an extremely small number of ads during its around the clock , ah , tv broadcast .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , in addition , it has such a large team , especially with high , high , er , wages , and reporters based abroad , so many reporters abroad . if the government had not supported such expenditures , eh , it would be impossible for a private tv station to survive .
according to your knowledge , how much is its yearly expenditure ?
it was said that the yearly expenditures seem to be about 7 billion us dollars .
about 7 billion us dollars , that is equivalent to more than 50 billion rmb . we should say this is a very huge financial expenditure .
uh-huh .
extremely large .
yeah .
therefore , some people call it gaining voice but losing money because it has relatively small revenues due to few ads .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
but it has a tremendous influence .
right .
so , it appears that it is still not bad in gaining voice as it does achieve some effect .
yeah .
ha .
well , speaking of its influence , we have also noticed that er , during the afghan war , er , because it has the exclusive interview right to enter afghanistan to conduct independent and exclusive interviews , we could say this is one of its advantages .
uh-huh .
it also presented an opportunity to it as well .
well , to the development of a tv station , both opportunity and real strength are actually very important .
well , as al - jazeera tv station has been able to develop into its current status , what do you think has it relied upon so that its competitiveness and influential power , even surpassed cnn and bbc during the iraq war ? the greatest feature of al - jazeera tv station is that it is a small station that competes with large ones and has become well - known through wars . that is , the reason why it can establish itself is that it first relied on the afghan war , and then the iraq war after the 9 / 11 .
uh-huh . uh-huh .
so , it made full use of these two opportunities .
in addition , as the iraq war occurred right in an arab country , everyone is very much concerned with what is going on in the war .
so , this provides it with a large viewership , making it instantly famous .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
besides , it has a lot of resources , including its exclusive coverage right in afghanistan as you mentioned just now .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
in addition , al - jazeera tv station is actually quite unique in the arab region .
for instance , a very tough conflict in this region is the conflict between palestine and israel .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
well , in general , arabs will not invite the israeli leader to make a speech on their tv .
however , for al - jazeera tv station , it could invite barak , the israeli prime minister at that time , to deliver a speech at al - jazeera tv station . this was unprecedented in the arab world .
right .
uh-huh .
well , this also gave it a very unique perspective .
uh-huh .
so , the reason why it is successful , to put it simply , i think , is that it mainly relies on its own very professional news team .
it has a very talented team , eh .
yeah .
in addition , it also looks at major events as they happen from the unique perspective of the arab region or arab world .
uh-huh .
i think that favorable opportunities and geographical conditions also helped because people involved in the afghan war and the taliban were mostly arabs .
uh-huh .
they were from arab countries . they spoke the arabic language . well , that was the opportunity .
in particular , it was the same with the , iraq war , which took place in iraq .
in the , iraq war , as far as i know , among foreign media teams dispatched to iraq for coverage , i should say , the one from qatar 's al - jazeera tv station was the most powerful .
uh-huh .
it had three reporting stations at that time , one group in the south in basra , well , one group in baghdad , and still another group in the north in mosul .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so it was basically covering the , um , iraq war from all perspectives .
so , it surely surpassed some western media in covering the iraq war in certain areas .
uh-huh .
we could say it owed its success to good opportunities , which it seized ;
yes .
favorable geographical conditions ; that is to say , it happens to be located geographically in the arab world ;
yeah .
and also harmonious human conditions ; that is to say , it has its own very rounded and talented team .
er , that is why it is highly influential and competitive .
however , as it is becoming more and more influential and competitive , it has also become a thorn in the us side .
well , today we should say we have just given an introduction of al - jazeera tv station .
well , next let 's learn about more .
what conflicts are there between al - jazeera tv station and the us ?
why has it become a thorn in the us side ?
since it gained instant fame during the afghan war , the style of al - jazeera tv station in pursuit of the freedom of the press and independence has gradually won widespread international attention .
however , at the same time , the conflict between al - jazeera tv station and the us has been increasing .
according to reports , bush , rumsfeld , and powell repeatedly expressed their strong displeasure with al - jazeera tv station directly to the qatari leaders , demanding its government to restrain it more firmly .
the us government thinks that radicals , anti-american and religious commentators have become frequent guests at al - jazeera tv station .
in particular , bin laden has chosen it as his exclusive information release agency , endowing it with a unique advantage .
all these made the us hate and fear al - jazeera tv station at the same time . officials of the bush administration called it osama 's tv station on different occasions because bin laden 's full name is osama bin laden .
during the iraq war , al - jazeera tv station not only broadcast bush 's and blair 's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward iraq , but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars .
the video camera scanned over the corpses of coalition troops killed by the iraqi military , and over that little tearful boy with bandages around his head , crying .
if you see the war on the us tv as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire , then from the footage by al - jazeera tv station , you see the war only as hell .
do you still remember , ah , during the afghan war and the iraq war , we could often see on screen the al - jazeera footage such as bin laden and some other al - qaeda leaders giving speeches .
ah , moreover , the footage that many other tv stations were using also basically came from al - jazeera tv station .
therefore , at that time americans , said that since al - jazeera tv station broadcast these activities of terrorists , it must be colluding with terrorists .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so , it was always thought that there seemed to be some subtle relationship between al - jazeera tv station and al - qaeda .
taciturn agreement .
taciturn agreement .
yeah .
taciturn agreement .
right , mr. wu , how do you look at this issue ?
this may have something to do with the good opportunities and favorable geographical conditions mentioned earlier .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
since , er , the taliban people were all arabs , they tried by various means to gain the information so as to expand their own influence .
this has been the consistent practice of al - jazeera station .
uh-huh .
well , the same goes with the iraq war .
they , eh , also speak arabic , right ? another arabic nationality .
uh-huh .
what they reported , eh , was very much welcomed and favored by arab viewers . uh-huh . that 's because what they have reported can not be found in the western media reports .
that 's why their fame grows .
that is to say , it indeed inspires a kind of patriotic or nationalistic sentiments among arab countries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
i think , this point is very important .
in other words , it also benefits from the hard work of al - jazeera tv station .
that is , it is from the perspective of arabs that it looks at the war or also looks at major events .
so , when it makes a report , its perspective , analysis , and its possible outcome or some process of its analysis are different from those of reports by the western mainstream media such as cnn and bbc .
well , it is exactly because of this , even if al - jazeera tv station may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations , simply because it reports the war using a different voice , it has become the target of attacks by the us or the west .
right .
well , regarding this incident , what kind of reaction did al - jazeera tv station have ?
we do n't have much information right now .
but when our correspondents went to have an interview at the al - jazeera tv station 's beijing office today , they asked their office administrator named ezzat , ah , the question why the us threatened to bomb al - jazeera tv station ?
he is also a china expert and speaks excellent chinese .
let 's hear what he said .
-- in the middle east region , in particular , currently , , some us officials , for instance , many democrat officials , they admitted that the us policies on iraq and the middle east , eh , region have many mistakes .
er , this point must be acknowledged .
however , up till now , er , the bush administration , they did not want to assume responsibility for what they have done there .
so , it wanted to blame its mistakes in this region on al - jazeera tv station .
second , it is because some things are in conflict with its interests .
however , when i report , i do n't report for the sake of making somebody happy or not making somebody unhappy .
this is not my principle , nor is my job . some of the footage we broadcast did not conform to its interests .
so it started to put this restrictive measure in retaliation . so , the issue is not that al - jazeera tv station is making anti-american reports .
in addition , the us government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in the middle east region and against the world peace .
as you know , we were , eh , reporting the war in fallujah .
our reporter also , eh , almost had an accident there as several shots were purposely , er , fired at him .
then , in the end , er , secretary rumsfeld also directly blamed al - jazeera tv station .
er , , er , most of what the reporter said , er , was groundless .
in the end , later , did we say anything later ? we stopped talking . we then showed viewers facts and let the images speak by themselves . we did not do anything at that time .
our reporters were forced not to make any commentaries or any reports . we simply showed people the footage about fallujah .
well , the facts may not conform to the interests of mr. bush .
uh-huh , uh-huh . in fact he mentioned a very important point of view here .
ah ,
uh-huh .
that is to say , this al - jazeera tv station , due to its unique perspective , is different from what is expected of it .
at al - jazeera tv station , there is , one famous saying , that is , if the whole world listens to cnn , or the whole world watches cnn , then whom does cnn watch or listen to ?
that is also an issue of the right of speech .
well , in fact , the us has long been suppressing al - jazeera tv station .
for instance , the al jazeera tv station 's office in afghanistan was bombed in 2001 .
yeah .
uh-huh .
well , in 2003 , the al - jazeera tv station 's office in baghdad was also bombed .
on april 8 , its reporting station in baghdad was bombed , and one reporter was killed .
yeah .
right .
in addition , currently one of its reporters is still detained by the us at the guantanamo military base .
right .
eh , it was said that a sudanese correspondent from al - jazeera tv station , er , was arrested in afghanistan and has been detained ever since at this , er , us military base at guantanamo .
right .
yeah .
we could say that the us has been suppressing al - jazeera tv station for quite a long time .
yeah .
well , through what ezzat said himself , he also thought he was innocent .
uh-huh .
he basically also blamed it on the us .
well , will al - jazeera tv station really sue us president bush ?
will us president bush have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified ?
would you please analyze how this incident will develop next .
i think that right now , it has actually entered into a certain judicial procedure in some sense .
uh-huh .
that is to say , the british judicial authority has already brought charges against these two officials , er , suspected of disclosing secret documents .
uh-huh .
well , now we have seen that the director of al - jazeera tv station has also flown to london to demand an explanation from blair .
uh-huh .
to bring up a lawsuit .
right ? that is , i think that right now it is more likely to stay for a while as a topic of public commentaries .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it will stay as a topic of public commentaries , because if the us indeed had such a plan , then , the freedom of speech it advocates will be again greatly discounted .
uh-huh .
we know that the us , like the west , they made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media .
this reminds me of the year 1999 . during the kosovo war , the us blew up the radio station of , the former yugoslavia .
uh-huh .
it indeed blew up this radio station of yugoslavia .
right .
then , later , the westerners themselves , including the us , admitted that the reason why it won the kosovo war was to a large extent that they won the other party in public opinion .
uh-huh .
it seems that this incident will again lead to a public opinion war . uh-huh .
after this incident was exposed , ah , al - jazeera , tv station issued a statement last week .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
the main idea of the statement was , eh , that al - jazeera tv station has always followed the principle of impartiality , neutrality , and balance in news coverage .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
for that purpose , it is now seriously investigating the news about the us plan to bomb the al - jazeera headquarters in reported by , ah , the british newspaper , and it hopes that the british government can explain this .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right , it seems that this incident , as it develops , will have a lot of things worthy of our attention .
however , as we are running out of time today , let 's end our discussion here .
thank you two very much for participating in our program .
thanks !
uh-huh .
all right , dear viewers , that 's all for today 's edition of focus today .

it takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected .
dear viewers , the china news program will end here . this is xu li .
thank you everyone for watching . coming up is the focus today program hosted by wang shilin . good-bye , dear viewers .
hello , dear viewers .
welcome to focus today . today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in beijing over the holiday .
before dawn on january 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of jingguang bridge , east third ring road , beijing municipality , resulting in the road caving in .
relevant departments from beijing municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .
the traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .
well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?
after the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?
in addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?
well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us .
one of the two honorable guests in the studio is professor zhou hanhua from the institute of law of the chinese academy of social sciences . hello .
next is yang yang , a host of beijing traffic radio station .
hello .
welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program . well , i especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?
ah , , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , i happened to find out through an sms when i was outside .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
it happened that i was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .
and then , the friend first sent me an sms , uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together .
after that , i received an sms from 1860 .
uh-huh , it was through an sms .
and you , yang yang ?
a friend happened to call me .
you were not at work that day ? no .
the station called me at noon and said something happened at jingguang bridge and that i had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .
uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .
right , right , right .
uh-huh .
well , like professor zhou , i also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone sms .
at that time , , it can be said that this sms was among the many , ha , sms containing new year wishes , like happy new year , received after the start of the new year .
uh-huh .
ah , actually i felt a lot of warmth when i received that sms .
although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , i think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .
yes , exceptionally .
yes , exceptionally .
well , what in fact was the content of that sms ? let 's take a look via this footage , ha .
i remember the sms was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of jingguang bridge at east third ring road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near chaoyang road , jingguang bridge , and east third ring road , and requesting cars to make a detour .
some car owners said that it was very good that the sms was sent .
furthermore , there was one last sentence in that sms thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .
ah , after the sms was sent , , i felt it seems to be the first time that beijing municipality , ah , used an sms to give notification at the time of a public emergency .
i do n't know , all of us are living in beijing , is this the first time , professor zhou ?
yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 .
uh-huh .
of course , in private life , people have used sms countless times to spread news .
yes .
other places in the country must have used this too .
uh-huh , uh-huh .
must have used this too .
actually , i remember receiving an sms like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in beijing to a rather large extent .
uh-huh .
however , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .
uh-huh .
ah , when an sms is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?
yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by beijing municipality , uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .
uh-huh .
for instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone sms .
in fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .
we usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .
yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the internet .
right .
it seemed that computers , ah , and the internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .
well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic ids , and such as , these electronic signatures . these are quite sophisticated forms .
uh-huh .
in particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone sms , are applied in e-government .
hence , i think this is , a test of e-government because , as i remember , during sars in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of sars , ah .
uh-huh .
they said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .
well , this time i think that a short sms like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .
uh-huh .
yes .
we drive often in beijing , ha , yang yang .
if people were not informed of such a traffic accident through sms on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?
yes .
ah , well , i think it would have been real paralysis . this is the most appropriate word to use .
furthermore , i think that when sms was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our china very well .
why is that so ?
this is because , it should be said that china is the country with the highest sms usage .
there are probably not as many chances to use sms in foreign countries compared with domestically , in china , ah .
so , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .
yes , i noticed that many friends , around me received it . it seems that almost everyone received this sms .
yes .
yes .
the effect was extremely good , ha .
so , how exactly did citizens react ? let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens . -- an sms .
i saw it was that jingguang bridge .
hey , i say , this is quite good , quite good .
have you received information like this before ?
no , no . this was the first time .
the first time ?
yes , yes .
well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ? quite fast .
really quite fast , ah .
so , i did not drive today . i set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .
do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?
ah , the response was quite fast .
in addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .
colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and sms .
i think this plan was quite speedy .
it seems that through this kind of sms , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .
well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .
let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .
well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .
well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the jingguang bridge at east third ring road .
all personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .
see , through this footage , we see , ah , this --
uh-huh .
okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock . that means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .
well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .
well , ah , yang yang , you work at traffic radio station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .
a special program . yes , a special program on this traffic .
so , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .
judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?
actually , concerning this , i think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in beijing .
previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in beijing .
that is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the jingguang bridge of the third ring road , it might cause the entire third ring road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .
uh-huh .
it might even impact traffic on the second ring road and fourth ring road .
well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .
well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from jingguang bridge to changhong bridge from the south all the way to guomao bridge , blocking the main and side roads .
well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .
hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .
however , actually after the entire day today , i came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .
uh-huh .
however , the affected area was not as large as expected .
moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .
right .
psychologically , people felt quite relieved .
because i know this situation .
right , like those whom we interviewed just now .
it was easy to handle once everyone understood .
yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , i set out today before the incident , and i did not drive after i was informed .
that person did not even drive .
right . actually , in this aspect , i think that citizens were really quite cooperative .
for instance , this evening , we , received an sms .
a friend said , i work on the 12th floor of the china world trade center at the guomao bridge , ah .
we were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .
later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the china world trade center .
right .
hey , he said this was quite a good idea .
actually , i think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .
yes , many , viewers not in beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .
ah , we can take a look later through an animation .
this road represents a main road on east third ring road , with problems on both the main and side roads .
furthermore , chaoyang road is an intersection .
uh-huh .
whether it is chaoyang road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of east third ring road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of east third ring road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .
well , chaoyang road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .
yes .
when people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .
yes , actually i think everyone can see that from the buses that cross jingguang bridge .
yes .
as buses that cross the third ring road are currently , right now affected by the jingguang bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .
uh-huh .
well , i think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .
if the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --
it is really like this , just look at the bus signs .
right .
have not seen so many buses .
right . its effect on people has been extremely extensive .
yes .
uh-huh .
well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?
our correspondent specially interviewed director meng xianlong , mr. meng xianlong , of the command center of the beijing municipal traffic administration .
let 's hear what director meng said .
um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .
in the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .
in this way , all vehicles going along east third ring road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .
east third ring road is a traffic artery in the east of beijing that links the north and the south .
in order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .
we set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along east second ring road , east fourth ring road , west dawang road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .
it can be said that measures were very promptly taken .
ah , today is the first workday after the new year holiday .
well , what exactly was the situation this morning ? we specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .
let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .
well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at east third ring road , ah , near guanghua bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of jingguang bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .
although the outdoor temperature in beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .
well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .
ah , it can be said , ah , yang yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .
uh-huh .
right , right .
, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?
actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone sms .
since we know that jingguang bridge is located in the cbd district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .
therefore , they sent sms saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .
well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning . we then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
this shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .
i think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .
on the other hand , i think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .
that is , they think that the government has tried its best .
well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .
uh-huh . as such , in this regard , i think people 's mentality can become very calm .
uh-huh .
well , professor zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?
yes .
in terms of citizens ' mentality .
yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .
that is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .
we know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .
time was lost .
well , yes , the state council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .
that is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .
in this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .
that is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .
i think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .
yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .
traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .
however , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .
yes .
yang yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?
right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground . they include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .
truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .
closely linked .
yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .
let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .
ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the beijing municipal construction commission , ah , the communication commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .
relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .
well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .
well , ah , professor zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?
yes .
this is also --
it is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .
yes , i think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .
how many groups of people will be sent ? many groups .
yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .
it is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .
uh-huh .
how can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .
for instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .
however , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by beijing municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of beijing municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .
hence , i think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .
uh-huh .
it was a very successful , er , response .
i think many good things can be summed up from this .
yes .
yang yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?
for instance , it is very cold during winter in beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .
er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .
well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of beijing .
well , , in this regard , the chaoyang district government did a very good job .
after it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .
it should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .
well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .
hence , over here , i think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households . i think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
professor zhou , actually for such a large scale city as beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .
yes .
i think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .
for instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .
perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .
this is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
it is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .
hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur . the critical thing is --
but the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .
yes .
yes .
yes , i think through a few incidents that happened in beijing municipality over recent years , such as sars , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at east third ring road this time , i think it can be seen that beijing municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .
right .
it can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .
um , well , i think , yang yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .
yes .
because you often have this kind of direct sms exchange with listeners .
it is because , we , beijing traffic radio station , has become a part of emergency planning in beijing .
well , beijing traffic radio station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .
well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by professor zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans . beijing municipality still had no emergency plan .
well , at that time , it happened that i was hosting the unblocked all the way program in the studio that evening .
well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .
ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .
it was not clear , it was very congested . you sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
you could find out other news only by telephone . the various methods and channels were extremely unclear . well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .
from our perspective as media , i think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .
yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .
yes .
it should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
ah , apart from this , professor zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?
right , i think this gave us many revelations , ah .
first , i think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .
this is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .
early warnings and forecasts .
yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .
uh-huh .
it is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .
uh-huh .
that is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .
uh-huh .
in this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .
uh-huh .
another thing i want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , i think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .
in fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .
for instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .
we have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .
that is to say , we have many corresponding systems .
however , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .
since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , i think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .
um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?
i think , in comparison to china , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .
their level of development is more advanced than ours .
although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , i think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .
for instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .
with a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?
how can a safe , assured system be established ?
well , we need to learn and manage this .
uh-huh .
for instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .
however , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .
well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .
well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?
we know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .
well , how will they undergo testing ? these also include some of our command and policy - making systems .
so , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , i think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .
that is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities . how can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?
the state council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called one plan , three systems .
uh-huh .
" one plan " refers to the contingency plan , and " three systems " refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
so , i think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws . yes .
well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in beijing .
traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now . well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .
well , yang yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?
i think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes . this is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .
therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .
uh-huh .
this is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone . there is also an issue with many of the pipes below .
yes , the pipes below .
right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --
moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .
yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .
but in the end , it requires time . hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .
just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline . the first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .
yes .
in addition , waste discharge is also very important .
waste discharged has currently blocked this up .
um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .
er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .
yes . at present , we should not have a problem with watching television . they are not broken .
it is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .
after that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section .
furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .
because they were exposed , the water pipes were not --
after that , yes , these were not damaged .
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .
um , there is no problem with water supply .
okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in beijing municipality .
at the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .
okay , thank you very much , professor zhou and yang yang , for coming to the studio to participate in our program .
thank you , both of you .
okay , dear viewers , that is all for today 's edition of focus today . thank you for watching . see you at the same time tomorrow .
hello . let 's turn our attention to the weather . today , we can use two words to summarize the weather in our country .
first , there will be a temperature drop over a large area , and next , there will be rainfall and snowfall in an extensive area as well .
we see that except for some areas of south china , southwest china , and northeast china , many other places will be experiencing temperature drops .
in addition , there will be snowfall in the area from northwest china to the huang - huai area through southern north china .
the east of southwest china , as well as the jiang - huai area and the area south of the yangtze river , will experience continuous rainfall .
however , southern north china and the huang - huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight , ah .
tomorrow during the day , snowfall in the jiang - huai area will stop , and there will also be less snow in northwest china .
in addition , there will be rain throughout almost the whole of south china .
it can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south tomorrow .
furthermore , temperatures tomorrow in many places south of the huai river will fall by between four and ten degrees .
okay , let 's check out the city weather forecasts .
beijing , overcast changing to sunny , 9 degrees below zero to 2 degrees below zero .
harbin , sunny , 26 degrees below zero to 16 degrees below zero .
shijiazhuang , overcast changing to mostly cloudy , 9 degrees below zero to 1 degree below zero .

a much better looking news night i might add as paula zahn sits in for anderson and aaron /.
they 're both off /-
look at that /.
is that a replacement /?
paula paula /.
thank you for your faith larry and thank you for your graciousness /.
and we 're going to get started here /.
good evening everybody /.
welcome to news night /.
as uh larry just told you i 'm paula zahn filling in for the two men anderson cooper and aaron brown /.
he lost his life long ago /.
but there 's still something modern science can give him back his identity /.
the mystery of the frozen airman continues /.
next stop the lab /.
and anger in the hood over a sign of the times /.
if fifty cent does n't have good sense then he needs to stop doing what he 's doing /.
the rap star 's new movie is one thing /.
but the billboards for it are another /.
residents of los angeles want them and their message moved /.
and the studio is caving /.
also tonight the rise and fall and rise and fall and rise and fall of martha stewart /.
how many ups and downs can one woman have /?
this is news night /.
first of all here 's a quick track of some of the stories we 're following tonight /.
president bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to help protect americans against the threat from bird flu /.
it includes stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million people /.
the president says there is no immediate threat but there is cause for concern /.
in washington tensions are high after an unsual senate session /.
democrats used a little used rule to force a special closed session /.
democrats say it was to force republican leaders to complete a long promised investigation into how bush administration officials handled pre-war intelligence on iraq /.
republicans for their part are calling it a political stunt /.
and defense secretary donald rumsfeld says more american troops could soon be heading to iraq /.
he says they will be needed temporarily to prevent an expected increase in insurgent attacks ahead of iraq 's parliamentary election in december /.
but we begin tonight with an ongoing mystery /.
who is that lone man discovered last month frozen in california 's sierra nevada mountains with just a few tantalizing clues to his identity /?
this we do know at this hour /.
the man died more than sixty years ago /.
he was in the military apparently a world war two airman /.
and while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains so did twenty - five other planes around the same time /.
thelma gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying to solve this mystery /.
an address book a plastic comb a vintage penny /.
you 're looking at the last things a young airman put into his pockets on the day he died clues to a world war two cold case that you 're about to see for the very first time /.
it is a mystery that begins high in the sierra nevada mountains at the bottom of a glacier /.
two weeks ago climbers discovered a frozen man face down in the snow still in his army air force uniform and an unopened silk parachute /.
after six decades the airman is exhumed from his icy tomb and thawed out /.
but he 's wearing no military dog tags or id /.
did this world war two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago /?
the search for clues takes us to honolulu hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.
the mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.
in this laboratory alone i 'm surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.
the investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.
and almost immediately clues begin to surface /.
dr. robert mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was caucasian and had fair hair /.
next though i 'm going to have to look at his clavicles /.
the airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.
this is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.
i think that uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that he would n't have felt anything /.
he would have died immediately /.
one two /-
another important clue /.
he has a significant number of uh fillings /.
like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.
root tips are closed /.
they 're sealed up which is more indicative of someone who would be at least twenty - one years old /.
and dr. andy henry notices something else /.
the airmen have straight teeth /.
so he had a nice smile good teeth /.
yes i would have to say that yes /.
then there are the material clues the things he had on him when he died that offer a snapshot into who he could have been /.
if there 's a badge or anything else that /-
we know he was wearing a world war two army air force uniform /.
remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.
and more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.
when i found these insignia i was happy to see them /.
and our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.
some of these dimes are in ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.
in his uniform breast pocket dr. paul emanovsky found this vintage schafer pen and three small leatherbound address books /.
the pages have been decomposing /.
but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?
and we 're going to put it in a spectral comparator /.
at first nothing /.
then like magic clues begin to emerge /.
uh you can see all these letters from the calendar sunday monday tuesday up at the top one nine four and two /.
nineteen forty - two /.
yeah /.
after hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.
and so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.
out of the thousands of unidentified world war two service members dr. mann says they 've narrowed it down to just ten /.
so what was it like to grow up there /?
in pleasant grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother glen munn whose plane went missing in the sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.
oh i just wanted you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here for burial and /-
we do n't know that though /.
we do n't /.
but that 's my wishes /.
and until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.
and in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.
thelma gutierrez cnn honolulu hawaii /.
and there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.
scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.
for an update we 're joined by dr. robert mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.
thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.
we understand since thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.
is that true /?
well hi paula /.
yes we have /.
uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.
and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.
and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.
so we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.
so how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /? well i think it 'll help quite a bit /.
um any time you 've got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /.
we have some soft tissue we can deal with /.
so we can look at the color of the hair /.
we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.
but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.
and that 's where we 're going to now /.
so in the interest of full disclosure what i know about forensics is basically what i 've learned on csi /.
and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential dna match with what you 've found in the ice /.
is it not that simple /?
well no no it 's not that simple /.
um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at /.
and what we want to do is we do n't want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.
what we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.
and when we look at this individual as we 've done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.
and what we 're able to tell from this individual is that he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.
and he 's caucasoid male /.
and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.
so the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who he is /? well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.
and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.
nobody knows for sure exactly when we 'll identify him /.
what it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.
if i were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.
well we 'll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.
know how hard you all are working in the lab there dr. mann /.
thank you for spending some time with us tonight /.
our pleasure /.
thank you paula /.
thank you /.
we 're going to turn now to some of the other stories in our world tonight /.
here 's erica hill from headline news /.
hi erica /.
hi paula /.
we start off with a tragic dispute after a traffic /.
a tragic death has now been settled in court /.
now the dispute came between divorced parents over where to bury their son who was killed in iraq /.
a california judge has now ruled army staff sergeant jason hendrix to remain buried next to his grandfather that is in oklahoma where his father lives /.
his mother claimed her son wanted to be buried in california where she lived /.
but the judge says her testimony was quote forced and contrived /.
austin texas republican congressman tom delay gets his way /.
the judge scheduled to preside over his trial was removed from the case today /.
delay 's attorneys heads off the recusal because they questioned the judge 's impartiality since he had contributed to democratic causes /.
delay is charged with money laundering and conspiracy /.
he has pleaded not guilty /.
in washington the federal reserve once again raising a key short term interest rate by a quarter percent /.
it is the twelfth such hike since june of last year /.
more could be on the way /.
in its statement the fed dismissed concerns that the economy has slowed down because of hurricane katrina /.
and in case you missed it the royals are here /.
today britain 's prince charles and his wife camilla laid flowers at the world trade center site in new york and then dedicated a nearby memorial to british victims of the nine eleven attack /.
it is the first stop on their eight day trip across the united states paula /.
and i 'm sure i 'll be hearing a little bit more about it all week /.
yeah erica i actually um bumped into them along with three hundred of their closest friends earlier tonight on their last stop of the day here in new york /.
and they were uh uh uh amazingly casual and accessible /.
we were all quite surprised /.
that 's good to hear /.
thanks erica /.
see you a little bit later on /.
and still to come on news night tonight the saddest post-katrina stories were those of the eldery who died in hospitals and nursing homes /.
now there are thirteen investigations into why and how such tragedies happened /.
and supermodels are n't the only ones to whom weight matters /.
jockies also may go too far to stay thin much too far /.
when at my worst i was heaving three or five to six seven times a day /.
starving to stay thin that and more still to come on news night /.
they happen to be the most vulnerable of hurricane victims the elderly many desperately ill living in nursing homes their fate in the hands of others /.
dozens died /.
there are at least thirteen investigations now underway /.
and at some nursing homes the failure to evacuate cost lives /.
in other cases it was the evacuation itself that proved fatal /.
here 's keith oppenheim /.
my mother was thelma wahl /.
she was ninety years old /.
she was a very good mother /.
she was at huntingdon because she needed care /.
priscilla scott is mourning /.
her ninety year old mother thelma wahl was a resident of the huntingdon place nursing home in chalmette outside new orleans /.
priscilla says thelma wahl had serious osteoperosis fractures in her vertebrae but says thelma was not on the verge of death /.
on sunday august twenty - eighth the day before hurricane katrina struck the nursing home decided to evacuate patients /.
they waited too late to make the decision /.
priscilla says her mother should have been transported by ambulance /.
instead she says her mother sat on a school bus for twelve hours to lafayette louisiana normally a three hour trip /.
she says police told her there was no air conditioning /.
police declined comment /.
the owner of the nursing home thelma wahl was being taken to tells us by the time the bus arrived thelma wahl was dead /.
i feel that uh the bus is what did it to her /.
she was alive when she left that nursing home /.
but she was not alive when she got to the lafayette area /.
cnn made repeated attempts to contact administrators or representatives of huntingdon place /.
but either we could not make contact or our calls were not returned /.
but staff for the louisiana attorney general 's office did speak to us by phone and confirmed that the matter of just what happened to thelma wahl when she was transported from this facility is under investigation /.
after dozens of patients died in the wake of hurricane katrina nursing homes have been under scrutiny /.
thirty - four patients were left behind at saint rita 's nursing home in new orleans when katrina hit /.
they all died in the flood /.
the owners were charged with negligent homicide /.
the county coroner says he urged saint rita 's to move its patients /.
they insisted several patients were too fragile to move /.
before hurricane rita a busload of nursing home residents were being evacuated from houston /.
but during the ride a fire from a back wheel accelerated because of oxygen canisters patients on board were using /.
twenty - three people died /.
federal officials are investigating /.
no charges have been filed /.
joe dodges executive director of the louisiana nursing home association says when it comes to evacuations elder care facilities are damned if they do and damned if they do n't /.
walk a mile in our shoes that 's all i have to say because anybody who works in a nursing home will very quickly learn that these are very fragile patients /.
we did the very best we could in these situations /.
we 've got /-
dodges says the reality is old sick patients are always in jeopardy when a hurricane strikes a dilemma made worse by massive traffic jams during pre-storm evacuations /.
i mean if they 're on a bus for nine or twelve hours there 's a good chance someone 's going to die unfortunately /.
certainly it 's a very very difficult question to answer should i evacuate /? jeff meitrod and steve riddyah write for the times picayune new orleans ' daily newspaper /.
they say nursing homes had to make tough calls /.
but last spring in a series of stories called state of neglect they reported that louisiana 's nursing homes are often poorly run and poorly regulated /.
nursing homes that kill residents nursing homes that um seriously injure patients um because of bad care /.
uh and the state does n't really do very much about it /. and so nursing home owners know that in a lot of cases it 's less expensive to break the rules and to hurt people than it is to provide the level of care that /-
huntington place was criticized in the articles and has had several law suits brought against it /.
but it had a good inspection record /.
priscilla scott says she is trying to contact the nursing home owners but has n't been able to find them /.
she feels even if they had to make a tough call they owe her a better explanation as to why her mother died /.
keith oppenheim cnn new orleans /.
it still is n't clear why huntington evacuated thelma wahl by bus rather than by ambulance /.
but officials have said there were not enough ambulances to take care of everyone in the region /.
tomorrow night i will have a special report on a struggle that affects more than ten million americans including one million men the struggle with eating disorders anorexia and bulimia /.
as i just said it 's not just women and girls who are affected /.
men too struggle with these disorders /.
and i interviewed one of the nation 's top jockies shane sellers about the battle he waged everyday to control his weight /.
in the morning i 'd get up and take a diet pill um drink a cup of coffee um and then head out to the race track and /-
with no food in your stomach /.
no food in my stomach no /.
and um you know you go and see the trainers and work your horses in the morning that you have to work /.
um by ten o'clock you 're finished uh /-
were you hungry at this point /?
oh i 'm starving you know /.
i mean i went to bed with nothing in my stomach either /.
maybe you know just a piece of ham or s- /-
you know just grab something to put in my stomach before i went to bed and head to the track and maybe lay down for an hour and then uh head to the hotbox for a couple hours four or five pounds of water /.
the hotbox is a sauna a fixture in almost every jockey locker room /.
the hotbox sweatbox /.
sellers would often spend two hours inside pooling or sweating off extra pounds /.
and are you miserable the whole time you 're in there /?
oh it 's horrible /.
you have to be very weak /.
weak /.
ca n't have nothing /.
yeah you 're already dehydrated you know /? so for more than twenty years you went through this process of basically not eating anything during the day sitting in the sauna a couple hours a day sweating two or three pounds off getting back on your horses training and maybe maybe having a piece of ham /.
and that 's all you had to sustain you /.
if i did eat anything sometime , when at my worst three or five to six seven times a day i was heaving /.
jockies call it heaving or flipping /.
doctors would call it bulimia /.
overcome by hunger pains sellers would eat massive amounts of food and then throw it up to make weight /.
he says a tour of a jockey locker room shows you just how easy and accepted it was /.
these are regular toilets /.
and this is what they call a heaving /.
this is where they heave /.
you know it 's a much different type of commode /.
i do n't know if it was especially made for that purpose /. but it 's sure not the same as the other /.
and that 's what we used it for /.
is it true that some of you got so efficient at flipping that you could actually do it without putting your finger down your throat /.
i was one /.
jockey shane sellers just one of the many people you 'll meet tomorrow night in walking the thin line /.
it is a special edition of paula zahn now that gets underway at eight pm eastern /.
still to come on news night tonight the senate shuts down the doors clears the gallery /.
was today 's rare closed session needed to gaurd national secrets /.
or was it a political forum /.
and the president wants billions to help fight a possible bird flu pandemic /.
sounds like a lot of money /.
but will it actually be enough /?
also tonight rap star fifty cent may be at the top of the charts /.
but one la neighborhood is n't buying it /.
we ca n't say how those who will be voting on samuel alito 's nomination to supreme court feel about him /.
but we can say something about how you feel tonight /. here are the results of the cnn usa today gallup poll released just minutes ago of those asked about the president 's choice judge alito to succeed justice sandra day o'connor /.
seventeen percent said he 's an excellent choice /.
twenty - six percent called him a good choice /.
twenty - two percent rated him only fair /.
seventeen percent thought he was a poor choice /.
questions about the facts or what were presented as facts that led the united states into the war in iraq spilled into open warfare today on the senate floor /.
democrats forced the senate into a rare closed door session /.
republican leader bill frist said the senate was hijacked /.
cnn 's ed henry was there /.
a democratic sneak attack that sent shock waves through the senate /.
mr. president enough time has gone by /.
i demand on behalf of the american people that we understand why these investigations are n't being conducted /.
democratic leader harry reed accused republicans of failing to probe allegations the white house manipulated intelligence to justify the war in iraq /.
and in accordance with rule twenty - one i now move that senate go into closed session /.
president i second the motion /.
an easy but rare maneuver with extraordinary consequences /.
the senate chamber was locked down , television cameras shut off , so law makers could go into secret session to debate /.
republican leader bill frist was enraged /.
not with the previous democratic leader or the current democratic leader have ever i been slapped in the face with such an affront to the leadership of this grand institution /.
there has been at least consideration for the other side of the aisle before a stunt /.
and this is a pure stunt /.
reed refused to back down demanding the republican led intelligence committee finish a long awaited report on whether the bush administration twisted intelligence /.
this investigation has been stymied stopped , obstructions thrown up every step of the way /.
that 's the real slap in the face /.
that 's the slap in the face /.
and today the american people are going to see a little bit of light /.
what 's really going on is democrats feel emboldened by the indictment of vice president cheney 's former chief of staff believing this is their chance to issue a broader indictment of the bush administration /.
we have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest /.
over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded /.
we are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight /.
and this republican led senate intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation /-
republicans insist they 're completing the investigation /.
and this is just a distraction /.
this is purely political /.
this is settling an old political score /.
democrats say they also want to signal they 're ready to stand up to the republican majority and may even filibuster the president 's latest supreme court pick samuel alito a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle /.
ed henry cnn capitol hill /.
so do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like /?
a debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come /.
turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned /.
you 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu /.
the most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from south asia to europe /.
and now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans /.
in fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time /.
today president bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic /.
now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs tamoflu and rolenzo which in some cases prevent flu infection /.
and we now turn to senior medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupto who has just gotten back from south asia where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty - two people about half of those who were struck with it /.
hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease /.
and dr. gupto now just joins us from the emory university hospital in atlanta /.
always good to see you doctor /.
so /-
thanks /.
i know you 've had a chance to study the plan the president put forth today /.
does it go far enough in your estimation /?
you know what 's sort of interesting paula /.
on one hand it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet /.
pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.
but a lot of people are talking about it /.
and i think that 's remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.
on the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.
the other thing paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of icus a lot of icus in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /.
the problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those icu rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic paula /.
uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where the president wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like tamaflu and rolenza /.
do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?
here 's the important thing about that /.
we do n't know for sure /.
a lot of people focusing a lot of energy on tamaflu and rolenza /.
these are antiviral drugs /.
they are not vaccines /.
they are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.
but we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.
the way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.
and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.
so it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work paula /.
dr. sanjay gupto thanks for the update /.
by the way are you catching a cold /?
a a little bit /.
you know i just got back /.
and the ninteen hour plane ride /.
not bird flu though /.
i can assure you that paula /.
chicken soup /.
that 's right /.
just what the doctor ordered /.
works all the time /.
yeah right /.
i made a free house call for you doctor /.
coming up on news night tonight , cooking a turkey is fine /.
appearing in one is n't /.
will her nielson do to martha stewart what her prison time did n't /?
rapper fifty cents or fitty cent as some of you say sells millions of records /.
but one neighborhood does n't like the sales pitch /.
they call him fitty cent /.
but he is worth millions /.
his music like the gold single pimp may come straight from violent inner city streets /.
but suburban kids from coast to coast love the heavy base beat /.
the music sells /.
but not everyone is buying the message /.
savela vargas reports /.
fitty cent 's film get rich or die trying has n't even hit theaters yet /.
but its marketing has already enraged people in south central los angeles /.
since two thousand there have been eight hundred homicides in this community /.
now who wants to uphold that standard /?
who wants to keep perpetrating that madness /?
the movie 's billboard shows the rapper in a crucifixion - like pose brandishing a microphone in one hand and a gun in the other /.
paramount you are doing damage to our community /.
you are doing an injustice to our community /.
and you committing violence in our community /.
and that includes fifty cent too /.
it must go /.
and go it did /.
a day after about twenty five people rallied in hyde park paramount pulled one sign down and since has pulled about half a dozen others near la area schools /.
i think what happens oftentimes people are so overwhelmed in communities particularly african american communities by say an image in this case hollywood /.
it just seems so big /.
it just seems so overwhelming /.
it 's almost like can we really fight city hall /?
whatever we 're going to do no matter how much outrage and anger that we express it 's not going to change anything /.
but in this case that was shown that that 's not the case /.
a paramount spokesman says the company is reviewing billboards in other locations /.
now similar complaints are coming from brooklyn new york /.
back in la the image hits too close to home /.
not too long ago we was over here /.
and a guy just pulled out a gun and was shooting right in front of my daughter /.
we did n't come back for a week cause i was scared and she was /.
so i mean that right there it enraged me /.
not a good message /.
no it 's already enough gang violence out here /.
we do n't need that /.
cynthia levas director of golden day preschool thinks the billboard touched a nerve because many children here are fitty cent fans /.
when it comes to abc they be like a b /.
and you have to wait for the other letters /.
but fitty cent song they can sing that word for word /.
rapper fitty cent whose real name is curtis jackson says it was ludicrous to single out his poster /.
you got to look at how often we put out action films and other films that utilize weapons as a marketing tool /.
we 'll find guns or weapons on the cover of films probably more often than we 'll find people 's faces /.
he thinks the controversy will lead the film to greater box office success /.
but to the members of this community the victory is knowing that somebody listened /.
man they heard us /.
they heard our voice /.
and i 'm glad /.
i mean i mean usually in this area nobody really cares /.
so for them to care about how we feel and how you know we raising our kids that meant a lot to all of us /.
so i 'm happy /.
savela vargas cnn los angeles /.

danger on the ground in iraq and under it /.
ied improvised explosive devices take a terrible toll /.
and prison barely dented her popularity /.
but can martha stewart survive her primetime ratings /?
everyday in iraq us soldiers work very hard to reassure local civilians train the iraqi army and stay alive /.
but with the increasing power of improvised explosive devices ieds staying alive takes a lot of training and time /.
eddie shrahmin is imbedded with american soldiers in northern bavil province /.
as the uh informants /-
come here strovell /.
listen up please /.
like the soldiers he commands lieutenant colonel ross brown suits up daily trying to rid his area of roadside bombs /.
whenever you roll out of the gate and you 're out there operating you never know if you 're going to hit one of these or not /.
the first stop today is route tampa some of the worst stretch of highway in what is called the triangle of death /.
salaam alakum /.
where these stall owners brown told are aware of impending attacks /.
did you know in advance that the ied was going to go off here /?
/.
tell him to look me in the eye /.
/.
tell me that again /.
/.
it is a fine line to walk routing out information without creating new enemies battling an insurgency that kills at will , that turns civilians into accomplices /.
i think they 're scared to death /.
i think they see us as temporary and they got to live with those people forever /.
finding friends locally seems the toughest part of brown 's strategy /.
but his next task proves just as difficult /.
here the lieutenant colonel has stopped at one of the firm bases one of the areas that iraqis are manning their own position /.
the commander on duty emerges out of uniform /.
and the lieutenant colonel struggles to find progress /.
they did n't do too much work yesterday /.
they did n't do too much work the day before /.
they have n't done too much work since they 've been here /.
/.
brown is unsure if this unit can survive an insurgent attack uncertainties shared by the us forces as well each soldier with his own way to cope /. hey morales you carry anything special with you on missions to help you out /? well i carry my wedding ring a bracelet my wife sent me /-
i carry a bible psalms ninety - one /.
a picture of an angel an archangel /.
i carry this little packet my kid gave me /.
see what my daughter /-
daddy i love you /.
i miss you /.
be safe /.
come home asap /?
is n't that cool /?
all right let 's go /.
overhead helicopters are responding to an ied attack that moments ago killed colonel william wood the highest ranking us officer to die in combat in iraq a personal friend of brown 's an added personal reason why tomorrow he 'll be suiting up again /.
eddie shrahmin cnn northern bavil province /.
and we turn our attention now to london where a memorial service was held today for the fifty - two victims of the bomb attacks in the city 's public transport systems back in july /.
queen elizabeth and prime minister tony blair attended as did relatives to those who died and emergency workers who responded to the terrorist attacks /.
andrew carey has the story of three firefighters who were first on the scene at one of the bombings /. a major incident in central london /-
four explosions ripping through the subway s- /- chaos on services with some passengers trapped underground /.
it began as any other day you know just uh doing eh normal checks /.
at nine o'clock we started our shift /.
and so the bells went /.
it was about a minute past nine when we got the shout for uh smoke issuing in allgate tube station /.
the explosion at allgate was the first of the four bombs to go off on july the seventh at eight fifty in the morning /.
but paul kelly steve sodbury and mel anderson of shadwell firestation 's blue watch had no idea what had happened as they got into the fire engine to answer the call /.
on the arrival at allgate we saw dozens of casualties outside the front sitting down /.
and it looked so serious that for one second i thought this must be like a training exercise /.
these people had flesh injuries /.
but they also had psychological injuries /.
they just needed reassurance /.
they just needed reassurance because a lot of them were scared /.
it always happens to someone else on the television a terrorist incident /.
as medical teams arrived at the scene steve paul and two other firefighters went into the station /.
this scene of walking down the platform and down the tracks with lines of injured people walking past you out the other way is /-
i 'll remember it forever i think /.
by the time they reached the second carriage they knew they were dealing with a bomb explosion /.
carnage /.
a man sitting down next door he had half his leg /.
um a person lying down /.
there was like a half a torso in front of the carriage as you go in /.
it sounds very harsh to say now /.
but when you 're down there and you 're dealing with it it kind of just happens /.
you go into autopilot /.
and you look /.
and you think i ca n't help that person /.
let 's move on to the next one /.
eight people including the bomber died at allgate /.
one hundred and twenty were injured /.
at the end of the day back home with their loved ones a time for the firefighters to reflect and some mixed emotions /.
to them it was their happiness to see me walking through the door /.
but i knew that somewhere someone 's daughter was n't coming home , their father was n't coming home /.
watching it on the news is completely different to looking in the eyes of a wounded person /.
as a fire brigade you 're there to rescue them /.
so it 'll always be a sense of regret as we did as much as we could but there was still a human cost and there 's nothing that we 'll ever be able to do about it /.
andrew carey cnn london /.
a producer from our london bureau /.
still to come the ups and downs of martha stewart and the british are coming ! the british are coming ! no wait /.
are n't they already here /?
but does anyone really care /?
and now we 're going to take a look at the trials and tribulations of martha stewart /.
you might have thought serving time in prison was tough /.
as it turns out , being on the outside might be even tougher /.
it seems like just yesterday martha stewart was sprung from prison and poised for her comeback /.
this is a country where we believe in second acts , we believe in redemption , we believe in confessional stories , we believe in the comeback , we 've /-
five months behind bars had n't dimmed martha 's image /.
if anything it was soaring /.
along with her company stock it doubled during that time /.
martha once again took the helm of her company and her magazine /.
she also landed a starring role in the spinoff of one of tv 's hottest reality shows the apprentice /.
martha the woman everyone loves to hate was loved /.
it 's really wonderful to be back /.
i 've missed you as you can imagine /.
but what a difference a tv show makes especialy when that show is a flop /.
i 'm looking for the apprentice /.
the apprentice martha stewart debuted in september /.
her ratings tanked /.
and her stock followed suit plunging about forty - seven percent since her release from prison in march /.
once again martha stewart is persona non grata /.
even her friend and fellow apprentice star donald trump made it clear that her show was not a good thing /.
he had this to say in a recent radio interview /.
i think there was confusion between martha 's apprentice and mine /.
and mine continues to do well /.
and the other has struggled very severely /.
i think it probably hurt mine /.
and i sort of predicted that it would /.
you 're fired /.
ouch smackdown from the donald /.
donald /?
martha stewart punched back in a recent fortune magazine interview saying she was actually told that she would be firing the donald /.
is the old martha back again /?
she has a track record of being associated unfortunately with the b word and not a little b but a capital b /.
can the comeback queen come back again /?
i think she can be saved /.
anybody can be saved /.
any organization can be saved /.
but it takes a lot of hard work /.
is n't that one of the reasons for our infatuation with martha /?
she 's the perennial story of celebrity redemption /.
she said this to fortune magazine i have learned that i really can not be destroyed /.
apparently martha stewart is betting on her own comeback as well /.
we 'll see /.
still to come on news night the prince and his brand new wife making their first trip to the us since their marriage /.
this time it 's not exactly a fairy tale /.
this week americans are getting a rare chance to treat royalty well like royalty /.
prince charles and his new wife camilla have jumped across the pond and are touring the united states making their first stop today in new york /.
it 's charles ' first opportunity to showcase his new wife /.
but few americans seem to care /.
here 's jeanie mowth /.
what a difference two decades make /.
charles and diana visited a jc penney 's on the prince 's last official us tour /.
twenty years later here 's the prince with his new wife attending a party at the museum of modern art along with yoko ono diane sawyer henry kissinger donald trump joan collins and even sting /.
but it still stings some diana fans to see those old shots of glamorous princess di dancing with john travolta at the white house /.
but when it comes to camilla gossip columnists can get pretty catty /.
we 're all welcoming the prince and the duchess or mistress of whatever she is this week /.
a lone protestor parked herself outside the un where charles would later visit /.
camilla you are no princess said her sign with a horse on it /.
the horse is basically camilla /.
we all know that she 's a horse /.
she does n't belong here /.
and she 'll never be able to take diana 's place ever /.
but at least the horse is pretty /.
the royals flew in amid headlines declaring their visit a royal bore /.
only ninteen per cent of americans polled said they were interested in the visit /.
eighty - one per cent said they were not /.
prince charles and camilla are in town /.
do you care /?
not a wit /.
royal watching is not for you /?
i have n't watched it yet /.
i loved princess diana /.
i do n't care for this new chick in town /.
sorry /.
the new chick and her prince started the day with a visit to ground zero /.
they then unveiled a memorial to british victims of nine eleven /.
everywhere they went there were curtsies and /-
well it has happened again /.
even years later the names still raise a chill paducah jonesborough columbine /.
tonight a new town another boy /.
but the terror is just the same /.
cnn 's david mattingly joins us now /.
david what 's happening /?
anderson about a little after two o'clock today a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun shot and killed an assistant prinicpal then badly wounded the principal and another assistant principal /.
and uh the suspect was taken into custody after he was subdued by staff here at the high school /.
he was taken to a hospital where he was treated for what appeared to be a gun shot wound to his own hand suggesting there might have been uh a struggle going on afterwards /.
but police here tonight are continuing to look for any bit of evidence that they can /.
as soon as this happened the school went into a lockdown /.
the students were not allowed to leave their classes /.
this went on for about two hours before they were finally let out and everyone was finally able to figure out what had happened here /.
so many people shocked and absolutely stunned by what happened /.
so many times we have heard today that i ca n't believe this happened in our small town /.
but this tragdey definitely has come to roost here after taking the life of a very popular assistant principal here anderson /.
uh this is jacksborough tennessee we 're talking about /.
how big a place is jacksboro /?
um not very big at all /.
in fact when i asked the sheriff exactly how many people were here he said he could n't really tell me that it 's just that he gave me the county at large but there were thirteen hundred students here at the school /.
this is the one big high school for this county /.
so not many people at all /.
everyone knew uh the people at this school particularly this administrator and assitant principal ken bruce /.
students tonight saying he was very well - liked very approachable the kind of teacher who would actually give you lunch money if you forgot to bring it with you that day /.
so they 're talking about him tonight /.
they 're going to be missing him very much in the future anderson /.
about a little after two o'clock today a fifteen year old student wielding a hand gun shot and killed an assistant principal then badly wounded the principal and another assistant principal /. and david do we know what time of day this happened /?
shortly after two o'clock today it happened near the office of this school /.
in fact some witnesses at the office say it happened just right there next to them while they were there trying to conduct some business at the school /.
uh police are still trying to figure out what led up to that , why the student was there at the office and what exactly transpired between him and the administrators before those shots were fired /.
all right appreciate that /.
i know you uh just got to the scene /.
uh it 's going to be a long night and a long couple of days as we 're trying to piece together uh the information exactly what occured in those terrible moments before the shooting /.
here 's where the story and the backstory really start coming together /.
it 's very much an involving process as david just said /.
the young man has spoked to the police but no one is saying what he said /.
there 's a closed crime scene out there tonight evidence still to be gathered people questioned statements taken /.
at some point the picture 's going to snap into focus tonight though we only have sketches /.
with us now from jacksboro tennesse ethan riggs who knows the suspect well and ethan 's cousin nathan lawson who was at the school today /.
uh guys i appreciate you being on the program tonight /.
you nathan you were at the school when it all unfolded /.
what did you see /?
well we could n't see anything because we were all in class /.
and i just heard about uh the student going into the office or around the office and shooting the prinicpal and the assitant principals that were there /.
and what happened /?
uh you were in class /.
i mean how did they alert people what happenend /?
well we were already in class /.
and mr. steele got on the intercom and told everyone that we were having a lockdown /.
and how long did the lockdown last for /?
uh an hour and half two hours /.
uh ethan how long have you known the alleged shooter /?
i should just point out to our viewers we 're not using the young man 's name /.
uh he 's underage /.
it 's policy and impolicy not to do that /.
um how long have you known him /?
well i knew him for a while back in elemetary school but not much uh from here for a while back /.
but back in elementary school he was an all - right person and hardly ever got into any trouble /.
uh were you surprised to hear that he might be involved in a shooting /?
yeah i was /.
nathan how about you /?
did you ever think your classmate was capable of killing /?
no not really /-
uh he 's been in some trouble before but nothing like this /. i would never think that he would do anything like this /.
do you know what kind of trouble he had been in before /?
well in middle school he got suspended for a year for stabbing mr. steele with a pencil /.
he stabbed somebody with a pencil /?
yeah the principal /.
the principal okay /.
uh now nathan or ethan i mean you know you hear these reports /.
teen shooters they 're often descibed as you know kids who have been picked on or bullied by peers /.
uh was he that type /?
was he a loner /?
do you know did he get picked on /?
well in elementary school he was never picked on /.
like i said he had friends just like anybody else /.
would n't say he was popular or anything /.
but everybody got along with him /.
well it 's got to be just a bizarre day for you for both of you and a tragic day for your school /.
and i appreciate both of you being with us to talk about what you know /.
thanks very much /.
i want to talk a little bit more now on why not why in this case because frankly we do n't know that and we do n't want to speculate , that 's unknowable but why in so many other cases because even though it is too soon to tell whether this one fits a pattern there is a pattern and we have seen it time and time again /.
bitter experience has taught us that /.
here 's cnn 's heidi collins /.
columbine springfield pearl red lake minnesota this past march and now jacksboro tennessee /.
it is a list that conjures up images of screaming children injured victims and gun - wielding kids /.
different towns with tragically similar stories /.
what makes these young men snap /.
and what qualities if any do school shooters share /?
according to the fbi there are dozens of risk factors when it comes to school violence /.
but there is no one definitive profile of this type of criminal /.
most often the perpetrator is a white male age eleven to eighteen who was described as feeling picked on or bullied by his peers /.
we allow boys to be angry and aggressive /.
but we do n't allow them to express fear and sadness and other more vulnerable emotions /.
so hence when they get rejected or they get disappointed they have a harder time dealing with that /.
and it often comes out in anger /.
most of the shooters like you see in this video of dylan clebold and eric harris from columbine high school had a fascination with firearms or violent video games /.
/.
and while there were signs or warnings about their intentions they were not taken seriously at the time /.
the sheriff 's department did n't respond to our um reported threats by eric harris against our son for thirteen months /.
columbine would not have happened if they had investigated that to begin with /.
classmates say clebold and harris who brought terror to littleton colorado in nineteen ninety - eight and jeff weiss the red lake minnesota teen who killed nine people and wounded seven before fatally shooting himself all wore dark trenchcoats and were fans of marilyn manson /.
kip kinkel who killed two students in springfield oregon was a fan of manson 's music as well /.
according to the fbi all of the shooters may have felt the desire to defend narcissitic views of themselves and had very low self - esteem /.
luke woodham killed two students in pearl mississippi /.
well i guess you all start remembering me now /.
i 'm probably going to get pretty famous /.
famous for two things that seem to unite all of these young men no one believed they were capable of committing such horrible acts and no one was able to stop them /.
heidi collins cnn new york /.
we hear that over and over again /.
i never expected they could do such a thing /.
still ahead tonight more late election returns more races that could affect you more questions about how this affects the president and his party /.
also ahead in rwanda a country rocked by genocide ten years ago let 's see how it 's affecting the animals still to this day /.
around the country and the world this is three sixty /.
uh you know no matter where you stand politically it is tough to dispute the president 's good fortune /.
though battered in the polls this is an off - year for house and senate races /.
there are a number of races however being decided tonight /.
and as they count the votes across the country we 'll be giving you the latest on those races which may have national overtones as well /.
joining us now is cnn 's john king and jeff greenfield /.
uh let 's start with john king from dc with breaking news on the election results /.
john what 's the latest /?
well anderson the democrats are celebrating in the two biggest races tonight /.
those are the races for the governorships in virginia and new jersey /.
cnn projecting that tim kaine currently the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of the state of virginia /.
tim kaine a democrat winning in virginia a state president bush carried a year ago /.
and in new jersey another democratic victory /.
john corzine currently a member of the united states senate will be the next governor of new jersey according to cnn projections /.
one republican victory tonight /.
that is in new york city /.
mayor michael bloomberg the associated press projects will be re-elected as the mayor of new york city /.
a democrat turned republican /.
so that a frustrating race for the democrats /.
but democrats will celebrate those two state - wide victories virginia of course the most significant /.
president bush carried that state a year ago /.
he campaigned for the republican candidate just last night an election eve appearance /.
democrats will certainly make the case that the president 's troubles are continuing in the state of virginia /.
i will say though anderson i think the bigger national question out of the state of virginia might be that this helps the current incumbant governor mark warner /.
he is leaving office and thinking about running for president /.
his party 's strength there tonight will only encourage that /.
jeff any surprises to you /?
no uh the most startling thing which we do n't often talk about is the sheer amount of money that these people have /.
mike bloomberg is a five billion dollar man who threw seventy million dollars into this campaign /.
there were ads in cantonese and russian /.
he won a landslide /.
i 'll cross the river /.
john corzine 's worth about three hundred million defeated doug forrester a piker only worth about fifty million dollars though it was a combined campaign of about fifty million dollars /.
mark warner who john king just talked about has a personal wealth of two hundred million /.
and later tonight when we go to california the gentleman named schwartzeneggar who has about a hundred million dollars threw millions into his big successful effort at governor /.
but can the democrats really crow about what 's going on in virginia and what 's going in new jersey /?
well they will /.
um and they won uh and in virginia particularly /.
virginia was one of the first southern states to go republican /.
i think nixon carried it in nineteen sixty /.
it is significant when a democrat succeeds a democrat not just because it gives mark warner talking points but it is a crimson red state /.
do we want to make too much of it /?
no we do n't /.
john king uh arnold schwartzeneggar 's not on the ballot /.
but eh some of his critics say he really with some of these ballot initiatives /.
uh when do the polls close there /?
the polls close eleven o'clock eastern out in california /.
and to follow up on the point jeff just made about perhaps not overstating the impact for the president i think one of the things we will watch closely tonight is that some of the polls are showing that the american people are a bit testy shall we say um not patient anymore with all of the politicians /.
and that of course would affect the republicans more because they are in power in washington controlling the presidency and the congress /.
whether they take it out on governor schwartzeneggar in california could be another test of that as well /.
jeff /.
one quick point /.
the election that mattered for next year has already happened that special election in the ohio congressional district with cincinatti a republican district /.
former iraqi war combat veteran i guess he is a present veteran paul hackett came within four points of beating the republican in a district that no democrat has come close to carrying /.
that 's the one that 's giving the republicans willies for next year /.
all right jeff we 'll join you later /.
john king as well thanks very much /.
still ahead on three sixty a family torn apart on whether to let their son die /.
a case that may be heading where terri schiavo 's did /.
a fifteen year old boy at the center of it all /.
and in a corner of the world where genocide claimed nearly a million lives a new struggle between man and beast /.
around the world and across america this is three sixty /.
in a moment a life and death struggle over a fifteen year old boy who is in a coma uh who is lying breathing on a ventilator /.
the fight is between two parents who are divorced over what to do about their son /.
but first a check of the day 's headlines /.
here 's cnn 's erica hill in atlanta /.
hey erica /.
hey anderson we begin tonight in jacksboro tennessee where police say a student opened fire on a principal and two assistant principals in an office in a high school /.
one of the assistant principals was killed , another critically wounded /.
in iraq the foreign military occupation of that country is authorized at least through december of two thousand six /.
that 's because today the un security council voted to extend the mandate that allows some one hundred fifty - seven thousand us troops twenty - two thousand troops from other countries to operate there /.
the iraq provisional government requested the extension /.
in australia supporters of alleged terror suspect with tv reporters shouting stay away /.
australian authorities say they prevented a terrorist attack through their undercover work /.
seventeen people were arrested /.
officials said they moved in because the alleged plot had passed the planning stage /.
meantime a very different crowd reaction in salem oregon where two couples in - laws who invested forty dollars in lottery tickets had their claim certified today in the second biggest payout in us lottery history /.
three hundred forty million smackers /.
talk about a little bit uh of love to share around the family there /.
but anderson sounds like they 're going to lead a very normal life /.
they 're saying may not even get that many more presents under the tree this christmas /.
wow man i hope so /.
you know hear all these horror stories about how people react /.
and let 's just hope they sock it away and save it up for their kids or something /.
i know /.
erica thanks /.
we 'll check in with you a little bit later /.
you know it 's hard to think of a more agonizing decision that a parent could face choosing whether to let a child die or to hold out hope no matter what the doctors and all the other experts say /.
usually these horrible decisions are made in private /.
sometimes unfortunately they divide an entire country /.
the sad case of terri schiavo not only tore her family apart /.
it really re-ignited a debate as thorny as it is heartbreaking /.
the case of jansen jones is just as complicated and equally heartbreaking /.
cnn 's rick sanchez from bountiful utah with more /.
rick /?
yeah thanks so much anderson /.
this is the new facility where uh jansen jones is going to be staying from now on /.
his father decided that he should be here /.
uh this is what we know about his case /.
he was probably unable to breathe accoding to his parents and experts who have talked to him for about twenty minutes /.
now we 've talked to medical experts about this situation /.
and they tell us if a fifteen year old goes without oxygen for fifteen to twenty minutes , what results is usually severe and irreparable brain damage /.
here now is jansen 's story /.
you 're not supposed to have a heart attack when you 're only fifteen years old /.
i 'll never forget the morning that uh i got the news /.
the news was grim /.
margaret 's little boy with the likeable smile and the dimple cheeks had experienced full cardiac arrest /.
what 's worse it happened on this dark street corner one morning while riding his bike to school /.
he was all alone no mom no dad no help until finally he was spotted by a paramedic on her way to work /.
when we found him he was um still on his bike /.
um and his head was um against cement /.
jansen jones was rushed by helicopter to the hospital /.
did you think he would be able to pull through /?
i had faith /.
but then doctors showed margaret her son 's mri test and explained to her what results when the brain is deprived of oxygen /.
does he blink /?
no /.
does he make any sounds /?
no /.
nothing /.
nothing /.
are you convinced that he is in fact brain - dead /?
yes i am /.
margaret made a decision after talking to hospital officials here at the university of utah that she would take her son off of life support /.
she made the decision though not based solely on science or even her own observations /.
she tells us she made the decision based on her christianity her faith /.
and you do n't think that god would want you to have your son continue in the condition he 's in now /?
no /.
you 're convinced of that /.
yes /.
but god is also the reason margaret 's ex-husband jansen 's father gives for his decision to keep the boy on life support /.
he needs to be given a chance to live /.
also a devout christian john jones has little faith in what doctors tell him /.
doctors have been wrong before and misdiagnosed /.
i do n't agree with him at all /.
in fact when asked you think letting him go is the christian thing to do , she says /-
yes i think so /.
while he says /-
i believe in a living god /.
and i believe that uh you can still perform miracles as you want to call them /.
two parents one god and one life or death decision that may end up being settled in a court of law /.
rick how could this wind up in the courts /?
well here in the state of utah because the father had custody of the child they 've been divorced now for uh three years he would be able to make the decision /.
however if the mother decides that she wants to take him to court to see if her decision is allowed all the folks in this uh state that i have talked to who 've dealt with matters like this in the past say that judges usually allow the evidence to be heard from both sides /.
that would mean anderson what you would have is another court battle as you alluded to earlier similar to the schiavo case /.
all right rick sanchez in bountiful /.
thanks very much rick /.
you know it 's been more than seven months now since terri schiavo 's life came to an end /.
she died march thirty - first thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed /.
up to that point we got to know schiavo 's parents and her husband fairly well as their fight played out all too publicly on television /.
since terri 's death they have n't been seen much on the national stage /.
but their battles go on /.
tonight in a new segment we 're calling memory lapse we take a look at what the family is doing right now /.
teri 's husband michael is back in the news making a splash in politics far from home by endorsing the candidacy of democrat tim kaine for governor of virginia in tonight 's election /.
michael schiavo spoke out against politicians intervening in family affairs /.
he 's also been busy writing about his side of the battle over his wife /.
he and author michael hirsch are colloborating on a book titled terri the truth /.
it 's scheduled to be released in march /.
and that will once again put him at odds with terri 's parents whose still untitled memoir will be released that same month /. the schindlers ' book will share their struggle to keep terri alive a story they 've been through speeches and public statements /.
last week at a convention in omaha nebraska bob and mary schindler called terri 's death quote judicial homicide and hinted that euthanasia advocates may have been behind it /.
the schindlers also have been fighting the right to die movement through the terri schindler schiavo foundation /.
no doubt when those books come out we 'll be hearing about this case for quite some time to come /.
still to come on three sixty , it 's unlike anything you 've ever seen before /.
animal expert jack hannah takes us to a place where people and wildlife try to co-exist a place where both share a horrific past /.
and later a new look at your sex life a new survey is out the most extensive they say in fifty years /.
see how you may compare to some others out there /.
stay with us /.
a little bit more than a decade ago in the central african nation of rwanda something unspeakable happened /.
genocide though the us refused to call it that at first /.
eight hundred thousand people at least women men and children were brutally killed hacked to death stabbed thrown into rivers /.
today the genocide 's effects are still haunting both the survivors and the wildlife in rwanda /.
you see many of those who fled some of them settled in an animal refuge /.
renown wildlife advocate jack hannah director of the columbus zoo recently went to rwanda to see how the people and animals are co-existing /.
rwanda this breathtakingly beautiful land is soaked in blood the people living with the pain of their history /.
akagera national park once a spectacular wildlife refuge is now a refuge to many rwandans who survived the genocide and returned to their native land trying to start life anew /.
there are so many people in rwanda now they 've taken over two - thirds of the national park /.
and because of that rwanda now faces a problem /.
what will happen to the wildlife /?
how will the animals co-exist with humans /?
that 's what jack hannah the renown wildlife advocate wanted to find out as he went in search of wild elephants /.
there 's said to be eighty elephants in akagera /.
but for hannah and his crew finding even one was not unlike looking for that proverbial needle in a haystack /.
now the elephant 's back that way , right /?
hannah hired a boat to take him to a fishing village where there had been reports of a male elephant /.
they search for hours and hours /.
and finally /-
oh yeah i see it /.
but even a wildlife expert like hannah was surprised to find such a mighty creature submerged in lake water /.
it was very unusual behavior /.
look at that /.
he 's like a submarine /.
he 's going to use his trunk /.
whoa look at that /.
look at him move tha- /-
he is going fast /.
that is fast /.
big elephant /.
an estimated eleven feet tall , weighing perhaps fourteen thousand pounds the mature bull elephant was as big and angry as any they'd 'd seen before /.
and he started to pursue them /.
that is fast /.
remember elephants can swim everybody /.
and they got like a periscope /.
i do n't know if he 's walking or swimming /.
but he 's moving /.
hannah and his crew beat it to shore and to safety not realizing that in april the us embassy in kigali had issued a warning to american tourists about a rogue elephant charging visitors /.
your trunk go like this /.
on shore hannah was greeted by local kids /.
trunk /.
that 's it /.
that 's it /.
and in exchange for his kindness they shared a little known secret about the rogue elephant /.
turns out this monster of the deep was in fact an old friend of the children 's /.
and to prove it they lured him in with sweet words and sweet potatoes /.
thank you so much /.
thank you /.
thank you /.
that 's something else /.
that 's all i can tell you /.
akagera national park may not be all that it once was /.
nor of course is rwanda /.
but jack hannah says that there is a sense of healing and as in the mighty steps of elephants there are small steps being made towards recovery /.
had you ever seen behavior like that in elephants /?
no not in a while /.
uh when i saw the kids doing it i went up there /.
and i said i ca n't believe this big bull elephant a wild bull elephant /.
but the kids had you know /-
animals know people /.
and he knew no harm in that village /.
and they actually were taking care of it /.
and of course when he went in the musk i guess he tipped over a jeep or two and you got to be careful when that happens /.
we 're going to take a quick break /.
and then we 'll be back with uh jack hannah /.
a lot more uh coming up tonight on three sixty /.
stay with us /.
before the break we went to africa with renown wildlife advocate jack hannah director of the columbus zoo /.
he took us to a region of rwanda where those who survived the genocide of eleven years ago or ten and a half years ago are living side by side with wildlife /.
we showed you the huge elephant he encountered /.
and that was n't all he saw /.
jack hannah joins me now once again to show us exclusive footage of the mountain gorillas he visited /.
uh we were just talking about rwanda /.
i 've been there a lot over the years uh and have visited these gorillas /.
it 's the most incredible animal viewing i think on the planet /.
at least for me /.
yeah not just the viewing /.
it 's the experience anderson of being there /.
it 's just people do n't realize they can all do it as well /.
uh this last year in tourism increased sixty - seven percent in rwanda /.
and the gorilla population under president kagame has increased seventeen percent /.
one of the only countries in africa where animals are really increasing as far as population /.
and i mean some of the footage that we 're showing now is footage that you shot /.
and it 's incredible /.
you and anyone can go /.
a tourist can go and as long as they you know do it respectfully can go and sit with these gorilas just as you are /.
exactly right /.
right there /.
one hour /.
and of course you 're not allowed to approach them /.
they approach you /.
and that 's what you see here /.
these animals uh uh approach you /.
now this is one actually that was uh uh taken uh out of the wild and brought to a veteranarian 's place right there below uh you know where the gorillas are /.
that 's a lowland gorilla is what you 're seeing there uh one that was brought /-
and of course we just ca n't put it back out in the wild yet /.
uh the mountain gorilla as you know are the ones with the much longer hair live up about eight thousand feet /.
it 's where you went to visit /.
yeah i went there on vacation this summer /.
and it 's just incredible /.
there they are right there /.
they 're climbing all around you /.
they literally brush by you at times /.
what are the similarities to humans /?
i mean everyone always says how you know much like humans they appear /.
well well the similarities are it 's a family structure /.
and you watch the four and three and four years old play with the little uh eight to ten week old babies you know when their mother might let them go away just a little bit /.
right /.
and you see the proctection /.
they 're not a king kong type of animal /.
and the neat thing about it is there will be a web camera up there /.
uh john dick has got the tower up there so people can click on it within a year from now and watch the gorillas in the wild /.
no kidding really /?
be unbelieveable /.
that 's amazing /.
unbelieveable /.
wow eh the genocide i mean it permeates everything still in rwanda /.
i mean kagame has done a remarkable job with the country /.
um i mean how has it impacted on the animals /?
well uh uh a lot of the refugees came back in /.
some of them got into the parks /.
but now what he 's done , he 's protected those parks where no one absolutely nobody 's allowed to go inside the park boundaries now /.
uh the gorillas are coming back seventeen percent /.
tourism is up /.
as i said lake akagera national park is incredible /.
they even now have the habituation of chimpanzees /.
i just was one of the first people to go there /.
and so you can go to one of the only countries in africa and see the chimpanzees in the wild as well as the gorillas /.
you also worked with a woman uh rosamond carr who runs an orphanage /.
and you have some video uh of what she has done /.
oh gosh /.
she 's been there uh for years and is a legend in that country /.
for about forty - five years /.
uh she 's a remarkable lady /.
yeah she really is /.
we 've given the columbus zoo and al- /-
with partners of conservation we 've raised almost one point four million dollars for the orphanage as well as the artisans women with the artisans that do the baskets and the beekeepers /.
so we 're uh teaching people how to have productive lives in rwanda /.
this is her right here /.
and these are the kids by the way in the old orphange /.
and now she 's moving them up to her home in the mountains about an hour out of kasenji as you well know on the border of the democratic republic of congo /.
and what we did , we brought all sorts of things for the orphans there incredible incredible children /.
and these are kids whose parents were killed in the genocide /.
exactly /.
and by the way it 's all one rwanda right now as we were talking /.
no tutsis and hutus anymore /.
president kagame said it 's all one rwanda , we all are together now /.
it 's interesting because you go there and people are offended if you ask are you hutu or are you tutsi /.
exactly /.
because eh they do n't want those divisions /.
no they do n't want those divisions /.
and yet they all live together /.
and you would think that they would have that division /.
but you sure do n't have it /.
you have a tremendous love there /.
and by the way it 's probably now the cleanest country i 've ever seen in africa /. i could not believe what i s- /-
and the road system is incredibile /.
they 're good /.
what 's amazing too is you go to see the gorillas and you start talking to the guides who are taking you up and you ask them did you lose anyone and they will just turn and without blinking an eye tell you you know all my family is gone /.
yeah we had a guide do the same exact thing /.
and we said where 's your family /.
and he said i lost my dad and then goes right along and talks to his buddy who might be a hutu or a tutsi /.
and so /-
but they never ever mention that uh whatsoever /.
but i think it 's the greatest turnaround of any country in the world in the last eh ten years /.
and the gorillas are coming back , are n't they /?
i mean they 're /- oh yeah seventeen percent increase /.
and of course rwanda has about three hundred and seventy , right /.
uganda has about another three hundred /.
so you 're talking about a species that is very very vital as far as their numbers are concerned /.
you know if somebody got a cold up there like the veterinary project 's doing a great job up there right now uh you would have a disaster up there /.
so that 's why people ca n't have colds if they go up and visit the gorillas that type of thing /.
uh jack it 's always good to see you /.
i 'm glad uh you spent so much time in rwanda /.
and i 'm glad you talk as fast as i do /.
oh yeah i do /.
i got a little cottage over there /.
so i 'm going to be spending a lot of time over there /.
well you 're doing great things for the country /.
appreciate it /.
thanks /.
thank you /.
thank you /.
uh we 've got a lot ahead tonight on three sixty /.
horrible case of deja vu /.
another deadly school shooting /.
this time in tennessee /.
we 're going to have the latest on this developing story /.
uh also why some are calling the riots in france that country 's katrina problems long in the making that the violence has now revealed /.
and a report card well on our collective sex lives /.
/. jack you want to stick around for this the biggest study since the kinsey report they say /.
so how much have we changed in our habits in the last fifty years /?
you actually can get your questions answered about this /-
you can call us at one eight seven seven six four eight thity - six thirty - nine that 's one eight seven seven six four eight thirty - six thirty - nine or email us by going to our website cnn dot com slash three sixty /.
we 'll put your questions to some experts /.
welcome back to the second hour of three sixty /.
we know that women are essential /.
but are men even necessary /?
i 'll talk to new york times columnist maureen dowd about her latest book /.
also the latest details in the fatal school shooting /.
second hour of three sixty starts now /.
should torture be banned during interrogations /?
the white house says the ban is n't necessary /.
but without it some fear the military will go too far /.
i 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat /.
plus let 's talk about sex /.
the biggest study on america 's collective sex life in fifty years /.
and you wo n't believe the results /.
we 're taking your calls /.
this is anderson cooper three sixty /.
live from the cnn studios in new york here 's anderson cooper /.
thanks very much for joining us /.
let 's look at some of the other stories that are making headlines right now /.
at this moment a fatal school shooting in uh jacksboro tennessee leaves an assistant principal dead /.
no students were injured /.
authorities are holding a fifteen year old in the attack /.
the school 's principal and a second assistant principal are hospitalized with serious wounds /.
another cia leak probe may be in the works /.
this time the question is who told the washington post that the cia is operating prisons in eastern europe /.
republican congressional leaders have asked for an investigation /.
to baghdad now /.
another defense attorney in saddam hussein 's trial is murdered /.
a second co-defendant 's lawyer was gunned down /.
the killings are raising questions about whether the trial will resume as scheduled on november twenty - eighth /.
indiana now /.
the mobile home park residents who survived sunday 's deadly tornado will be allowed back to the area tomorrow /.
authorities put the official death count at 22 people in two indiana counties /.
back to jacksboro tennessee now where tonight campbell county comprehensive high school is a crime scene the site of today 's deadly school shooting /.
cnn 's david mattingly joins us with the latest on the investigation /.
david /?
anderson some new information for you at this hour /.
we 're hearing from knoxville the principal gary seal and assistant principal jim pierce are both out of surgery at this hour /.
both of them are now listed in serious condition /.
these are the two survivors of this shooting /.
a third assistant principal ken bruce was killed as a fifteen year old student opened fire with a handgun near the school offices /.
that happened a little after two o'clock today /.
and as you might be able to see behind me with all the flashing blue lights the investigation still underway /.
we have also learned that at this hour investigators have questioned others as to where this young man was able to get a gun and how he was able to get it into the school questioning others to find out if others might have been somehow connected to this case /.
but at this point most of the investigation is going on inside the building collecting every possible piece of evidence that they can /.
the suspect is in custody at a juvenile detention facility /.
he was taken there after being treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to his hand /.
investigators are being very careful about how they say uh this all came about /.
uh they 're not willing at this point to put any sort of a b and c sequence together /.
uh there are some people who knew this young man who say that he was troubled /.
but authorities will not confirm what was going through his mind or what was happening as this shooting occurred /.
anderson /?
david we 've spoke uh in the last hour to a young man who knows uh this young man who 's now in custody who said that he had been suspended previously for a year for stabbing an assitant principal with a pen or a pencil /.
do you know anything more about that /?
uh authorities will not talk about that tonight /.
uh we 're hoping that they will shed more light on that tomorrow /.
but we are hearing that story from multiple students /.
we 're not sure if it 's all part of the rumors that go around after these type of incidents do occur /.
but there seems to be some certain credibility in the widespread belief that uh this student did have problems the year prior and had problems uh as he came back to this high school /.
and david we 're looking at pictures now of the suspect being put into a police car /.
i do n't know if you 've seen the pictures /.
is that blood on his shirt /?
that is blood on his shirt /.
again he was treated for what looked like a gunshot wound to his hand suggesting that he might have been wounded himself during whatever struggle that occurred after these shootings /.
authorities tell us that he had been subdued by the time the first responders arrived here so that he was subdued by staff here at the school /.
after all that happened the school was in lockdown /.
the students were locked in their classes for about two hours /.
they were released uh to some very anxious parents here outside the school grounds /.
the school is going to be closed for the rest of the week anderson /.
there will be counseling here going on for anyone who needs it /.
and that goes for not just the students but the staff here as well /.
all right david thanks good reporting /.
as david it is an active investigation and crime scene as you can see very much uh still an active crime scene /.
uh if we had to pick a single thing to underscore how completely life has changed in this country since nine eleven it might be the fact that there are now arguments serious ones not only against but also for torture /.
never was a debate about this subject before /.
now there certainly is /.
cnn 's tom forman has been investigating /.
if you could save the life of a soldier rescue the hostage children stop the next terrorist bomb by torturing a prisoner for information would you do it /?
i 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat /.
retired general spider marks a cnn consultant worked for us army intelligence teaching interrogation techniques /.
the kind of enemies we 're fighting have no sense of right or wrong /.
they will go to any depths to achieve their ends /.
do we have to go with them /?
we do n't need to go with them /.
we need to preclude them from going there /.
and that might include some use of torture in order to prevent it /.
polls have shown that more than sixty percent of americans think it can sometimes be justified /.
but here 's the catch /.
experts including general marks are convinced with the vast majority of prisoners it just does n't work /.
it does not give you credible accurate timely inactionable intelligence /.
mark jacobson a former defense department official outlines the troubles /.
you need to know a prisoner has critical information /.
the prisoner must be succeptable to torture /.
and oh by the way when people are tortured , when people endure physical pain they 're going to seek to stop that as quickly as possible /.
if i torture you you 're going to tell me exactly what i expect to hear /.
the white house under fire over reports of secret cia prisons overseas says torture is not allowed /.
but /-
we are going to do what is necessary to protect the american people /.
we are also going to do so in a way that adheres to our laws and to our values /.
uh we have made that very clear /.
the definition of torture is infliction of severe physical pain as a means of punishment or coersion /.
legal authorities around the world are arguing over what that means /.
some insist the abuses at that iraqi prison easily qualify along with sleep deprivation humiliation extreme fear /.
others say those things do n't even come close /.
the global jury is still out /.
and even experts are pondering a paradox /.
so in your experience and in your view torture as a policy should be against the law /.
true /.
and yet we might still have to use it /.
true /.
and wondering which truth about torture will stand in a dangerous world /.
tom forman cnn washington /.
well it 's interesting president bush has said categorically we do n't torture /.
he also says we 'll do whatever is necessary /.
so what exactly does that mean /?
we asked a couple law professors earlier this evening to discuss the issue with us /.
john yoo of university of california berkeley who served in the justice department from two thousand and one to two thousand and three /.
he 's also a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute /.
also joining us alan dershowitz professor of law at harvard the author of a great many books including the case for peace how the arab israeli conflict can be resolved /.
also involved in discussion was bill goodman at the center for contitutional rights /.
here 's some of the conversation /.
professor dershowitz under what circumstances do you think torture is justified /?
torture is never justified /.
and i hope we never have to use it in the united states /.
but if we ever had a ticking bomb terrorist who could under torture reveal the location of a bomb that would destroy hundreds of thousands of people i guarantee you we would use it /.
that 's an empirical judgement not a normative one /.
and if we would use it then we have to use it only with accountability /.
and that means that the president of the united states or the vice president or the secretary of defense or the chief justice has to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that are permitted to be used /.
no extreme measures without accountability that has to be the rule /.
bill goodman you believe that 's uh a slippery slope /.
i think it 's a very slippery slope /.
i think once you start to say well under these circumstances empirically you 're going to and you have to provide these kinds of measures if you do it then you 're basically that under certain circumstances it can happen it should happen and then it 's going happen under more than those exceptional circumstances /.
it 's going to start becoming the regular rather than the unusual /.
professor yoo let me bring you in here um /.
what do you think about professor dershowitz 's argument that torture under any circumstances is wrong uh and that he supports the mccain amendment uh but at the president 's direction uh under extraordinary circumstances /.
i agree with much of what alan says /.
i do think torture is wrong /.
it 's illegal /.
what the mccain amendment is just repeating is the geneva convention standard that already applies in iraq /.
what the problem with the mccain amendment is , that it prevents the cia to use interrogation methods would not be torture but would fall under this vaguer term cruel inhumane degrading treatment which is /.
but what is your definition of torture /?
i mean uh i understand you were one of the lawyers in the justice department early on who helped craft documents outlining you know what some called a before nine eleven approach and after nine eleven approach /.
and the definition of torture uh that i understand from what i 've read that you were advocating was a very narrow one /.
look /.
we can all have an argument where exactly that line is /.
and i think it means severe pain and suffering either physical or mental can not be imposed /.
that would be torture /.
see /. i would have a broader definition of torture /.
i would define it very broadly then prohibit it /.
but then if it 's felt necessary to use any of these measures short of torture water boarding extreme psychological measures if the president of the united states is prepared to put his credibility on the line and say the future of the nation is stake we must violate the law in this instance like we would if we had to shoot down a civilian airliner let the president take accountability /.
and that would broaden the definition of torture /.
it would n't have any of these escape valves that we now have and would place accountability squarely where it belongs not on the shoulders of sergeant england or some other low ranking official /.
right now you 're just being an apologist for torture /.
oh come on /.
stop throwing around words like that /.
uh let me please finish /.
i mean that 's just insulting to the intelligence of the audience /.
look /.
let me finish /.
you know that /?
let me talk /.
and then you can answer /.
yeah /.
okay /?
you know better than that /.
what 's your point /?
my point is this that torture is new in the american discourse in many ways /.
we have not seen the prevalence , we have not seen an outcropping of torture notwithstanding all of the wars in which we 've engaged until this current administration /.
totally false /.
totally false /.
it was rampant in the second world war /.
rampant /.
and please /. i mean but is n't it true that there has always been torture /?
always /.
there always has but not in the degree not in the level not in the amount that we have seen /.
much worse /.
much worse /.
and the fact is that by saying that we are going to allow certain circumstances under which we will apologize for torture /-
much worse in the vietnam war /.
much worse in the korean war /.
much worse /.
i ca n't talk without me /.
all right you 're saying it 's been much worse /.
much worse /.
professor yoo eh president bush says the us does not torture /.
do you believe that 's true /?
yeah i believe it 's not true , that if there is abuses like abu ghraib occuring they 're just illegal and ought to be punished /.
professor dershowitz does the us torture /?
of course it does /.
and it does with a wink and a nod from the president of the united states from the secretary of defense from the vice president /.
just the message he gave yesterday we do n't approve torture but we approve doing whatever is necessary to stop terrorism /.
and that sends a mixed message /.
bill let me uh tell you something that senator roberts has said about the mccain amendment /.
he says and i 'm paraphrasing that basically the element of surprise what the enemy does not know about what we 're going to do to them is a very powerful tool /.
and so you do n't want to specify /.
you do n't want to write out exactly what can and can not be done /.
that is truly apologism for torture /.
that 's saying that torture does work can work /.
and it 's never been proven to work /.
bill goodman professor yoo professor dershowitz thanks very much /.
thank you /.
still ahead on three sixty . it may be off - year elections but they 're being closely watched /.
the latest results and what they say about the future /.
also the crisis unfolding in france what the riots and the raids behind them have revealed . and why maureen dowd thinks women of her generation were sold a bill of goods /.
all the things we did that we thought would make us more fascinating like high - powered careers /. and we wanted that snappy hepburn tracy dialogue because actually a lot of guys find that draining /.
we 'll talk to her about that and a whole lot more /.
be right back /.
election returns are coming in from around the country /.
there are uh state and local races with nationally known faces and issues as well as a celebrity or two /.
with us tonight cnn 's john king and jeff greenfield /.
let 's start with breaking news and john king in dc /.
what 's the latest john /?
anderson more statements from the democrats celebrating tonight more events planned by the democrats tomorrow /.
they believe they have the upper hand in these off - year elections /.
the two biggest races the races for the governorships of virginia and new jersey /.
democrats winning in both of those states we can show you here /.
cnn projecting that tim kaine now the lieutenant governor will be the next governor of virginia winning quite handily fifty - two to forty - six percent over republican jerry kilgore /.
also in the state of new jersey john corzine the democrat with fifty - four percent of the vote right now beating doug forrester the republican just forty - three percent /.
ninety - one percent of the vote counted in new jersey /.
ninety - nine percent of the vote counted now in virginia /.
two democratic victories in the races for governor /.
republican michael bloomberg will win re-election in new york /.
republicans will celebrate that /.
that a source of frustration to democrats /.
how much does this mean nationally /?
that race in new jeresey was much more personally nasty about property taxes perhaps than about president bush or any national issues /.
the virginia race about the death penalty about other state issues as well traffic number one among them /.
but the democrats will certainly that the virginia race is proof that the republican base is demoralized /.
that will be studied anderson as we look at these off - year elections and how much they play into next year /.
many state ballot questions that are of some national import tonight /.
a anti-gas tax initiative in washington state /.
we wo n't get the results there until tomorrow /.
a split verdict if you will on the issue of gay rights /.
texas voters adopting a constituional amendment to finding marriage as between a man and woman /.
but supporters of gay rights winning a referendum in the state of maine /.
that is something to watch heading into next year as well because republicans think that helps increase turnout among conservatives /.
and ballots of course /.
uh the polls are still open in california /.
so we do n't know about the ballot initiatives there /.
is arnold schwarzenegger 's reputation on these ballots /?
yes they did /.
and they were not the first company that approached me /.
but i am not selling medicine or pharmaceuticals /.
i 'm sort of about selling a full body approach to wellness /.
um there 's a big gap between those that are mentally ill and the general population /.
something like eight to twenty years less life expectancy with mental illness /.
really /?
people are not able to care for themselves /.
they do n't make regular checkups with their doctor /.
they medicate with alcohol and too much food /.
and because of those lifestyle choices you know they 're dying sooner /.
so i really wanted to get out and address that and offer some common sense approaches /.
do you use medication too /?
i do use medication /.
do you name the drug you take /?
alright let 's go back linda /.
i do not name the drug /.
i do n't really feel that that 's responsible to name any drug /.
when was that first day problem /?
well looking back i feel that a lot of my life there was a problem /.
as a teenager you mean /?
as a teenager even as a younger girl i had some depression /.
but no one really noticed it was depression /.
nor did i know in those days that that 's what it was /.
but i did feel different from other people /.
um i was in hiding a lot of my childhood although i had a wonderful upbringing and a very normal middle class upbringing /.
where 'd you grow up /?
in maryland on the chesapeake bay /.
ah north west /.
salisbury maryland /.
what 'd your father do /?
my father was a doctor /.
oh /.
who died when i was five /.
oh /.
but he was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder /.
in those days they called it manic depression /.
but he had extreme mood swings and died in a car crash when i was five /.
and so it 's hard to separate you know what was the reality for me /.
was it loss of father that drove me into depression /?
and you know we can all look around and find situations that fuel a certain feeling in our lives /.
but i realize now looking back over my life that i was really just in hiding um comforted myself with food , i was a compulsive eater /.
overweight /?
by the time i was in high school i was a hundred and seventy pounds /.
and i was just very alone in life /.
did you get uh moody a lot /?
i was moody /.
but i think it was only when i got out of my childhood home and started having the freedom to be the wild girl and express all that was inside of me that i really got into trouble /.
were you a wild girl /?
i was a wild girl /.
i was a real alcoholic for the longest time /.
i messed with drugs /.
i mean i 've come through a lot of things /.
did you go to college /?
i was a chaotic mess even at the age of twenty two /.
i think that was probably the lowest of the low for me when i was twenty two years old and went into a therapist 's chair with such a broken heart such a broken life you know and a friend that had recently died just sort of pushed me over the edge /.
and you know it 's the best thing i ever did /.
i sought help for twenty years /.
i worked tirelessly to conquer my behaviors /.
you were in therapy for twenty years /?
for twenty years different therapies different body work acupuncture /.
i 've worked with psychiatrists therapists healers /.
no i mean i am a seeker /.
so i worked really hard to kind of curtail those behaviors /.
but i could not be in charge or in control of my behavior until i went on medicine when i got the proper diagnosis /.
and then i was able for the first time in my life to step back /.
did you go to college /?
i went to college for two years /.
what school /?
ah i went to washington college in chestertown maryland /.
did you have problems there /?
um i was an outsider even then /.
i lived off campus /.
never really felt like i belonged in the college drama department /.
i was always sort of separate /.
um and then when i realized that my real passion was for acting i took the rest of my money and my college fund and moved to new york and studied and maintained rather well in new york /.
when i got to los angeles at the age of twenty two all hell broke loose /.
even though you got acclaim and did well /.
so how do you explain /?
that 's a dichotomy /.
i mean some of us are luckier than others /.
what was your break /?
even though i say you know that i was under the you know terrible burden of mental illness i think there was a real survivor streak in me and a real fighter and a real fierceness /.
and maybe that 's what people saw and hired me for you know cause i was really just going to keep pushing until i got free of all of the things that were bothering me /. what was your first break in la /?
my first break was a movie for television that i did with mickey roarke /.
mickey roarke was just breaking big at the time /.
and i replaced an actress actually who was just in over her head /.
mickey i think was an intimidating presence /.
and they had hired a girl who had done very little had done a lot of stage work but just was n't prepared to come to work and face mickey roarke /. uh remember the greta rideout and john rideout story the first woman who sued her husband for rape /?
i played her in a film with mickey /.
when you hit it big with terminator and everything was going fantastic for you you were still bipolar , right /?
well very much /.
and somehow the bigger the life the bigger the illness /.
it just kept growing the illness my behavior /.
so you 'd get into a certain pattern of behavior /.
and now you 're dealing with a pattern of behavior as well as an emotional illness /.
so this did n't help it /?
no no i think it gave me a wonderful arena in which to act out all my rage /.
i 'd be like you 're really good at being mad /.
but uh for success it 's all about how you feel about yourself inside /.
and inside i was just a scared and out of control hurt little girl for most of my life /.
did marriages help /?
no um /.
you had two /?
as a matter of fact i would say /-
yes two marriages one to james cameron and before that to bruce abbot /.
i have a child with each /.
i would like to take this moment to say that i was n't married to peter horton which is sort of all over the websites that i 've been married three times so i look like /-
but that 's false information /.
i was never married to peter horton /.
how old are the children /?
um how old are the children /?
my son is sixteen /.
and my daughter is twelve /.
and how are they doing /?
they 're doing well /.
any signs of bipolar in them /?
no /.
but boy they have someone that 's watching them all the time for any signs /.
we have a household where we talk about our feelings and make sure that no one is afraid to speak of what 's going on /.
i just find it strange that in this world everyone is so easy to talk about the superficial you know and how people look and what they do to their faces but no one is really having the dialog of what 's going on inside of them /.
and i think that i hid my symptoms pretty well for most of my life /.
but there 's still a raging war going on /.
we 'll ask linda when it got its worst , how bad it got , what were some of the concepts she had to go through /.
we 'll be taking your calls at the bottom of the hour /.
tomorrow night rod stewart /.
we 'll repeat the roseanne barr interview sunday night and monday night /.
this is an eclectic show /.
colin powell robert downey jr. and sharon stone /.
way to make a living /.
we 'll be right back /.
we 're back with linda hamilton /.
were you comfortable because of the illness being frantic /?
actually i think that was a pretty ordinary place for me to go to /.
so it was n't hard for you to go nuts , right /?
i was frantic inside /.
no /.
and to just sort of let it get out there in a way that was you know safe /.
at its height how bad was it /?
what would you hallucinate /?
um it was not terrible hallucinations /.
at its height the biggest low was uh the birth of my second child and a post-partem depression that followed which was very much like a psychosis /.
i could n't leave the house without thinking that they were going to be chopped into bloody pieces /.
i mean i had visions /.
i could n't leave my house without feeling /-
you know at this point i had gone through thirteen nannies or something /.
and i just did not feel that my kids were going to be ok if i was not in the house protecting them /.
did you ever think you would harm them /?
that happens sometimes /.
um no i have not ever felt that /.
but i know people that have /.
and i praise god that that did n't happen to me /.
did you have hallucinations too /?
not hallucinations as you would call them but cyclical thoughts that repeated terrible sleep disturbances /.
months would go by where i would n't get a decent night 's sleep , where it would literally feel like i could n't sleep /.
i had anxiety attacks /.
how did your husbands deal with this /?
well um i was a challenge /.
i think jim said to me once i like who i leave in the morning but i do n't always know who i 'm going to come home to at night because depending on what had happened during the day if something had distressed me , a small thing had become a huge thing and i could n't let it go and i could n't forgive and i could n't get out of myself and i just could n't let go /.
he directed you , did he not /?
yes he did /.
was that hard or easy /?
well he directed me long before we fell in love and had a relationship /.
and it was actually a long time before because it was 1984 when we first met and did the first terminator /.
so i had known him more than ten - fifteen years before we got married /.
could you work while depressed like mike wallace /?
yes i could work /.
yes i think there was an element of real survivor in me that was very highly functioning during most of this /.
and even with the alcohol abuse i think most people in my life did not notice that i was putting away enormous amounts of alcohol /.
did n't notice it /?
did n't notice it /.
um it 's amazing how tricky we can be /.
um or a lot of people must think that they 're getting away with something /.
but everyone really does notice /.
but i tell you /.
there was no one in my life at that point saying hey you need help /.
suicidal thoughts /?
um more about not wanting to be alive , not knowing how to thrive , not knowing what hope was /.
it was a very bleak existence /.
but i never would have taken the action to kill myself um just cause i 'm a real nice girl and a pleaser and i could n't have done that to my family /.
someone said once when you 're really depressed good news and bad news are the same news /.
you could inherit five million dollars or lose five million dollars /.
it do n't change how you feel /.
true /?
true true /.
and no amount of counseling and therapy and taking my past apart helped /.
i would understand that i had lost my father , therefore i was creating one relationship after another of abandonment /.
and you know that for years going into it and still ca n't control the behavior /.
it was very frustrating /.
at a certain point i was just completely handicapped /.
i did not know /.
i said give me a behaviorist then /.
i 've got to change these behaviors /.
the rage /.
yeah what happened when you had a rage /?
i would throw jim 's stuff out of the house /.
so it would be waiting for him when he came home at night /.
this could be over a small thing /?
yes /.
um and i just would n't give in /.
if he would n't apologize i could n't go to any other place except i wish this had n't happened /.
and that 's no way to live a life /.
what was your love life like /?
well my two husbands were the sum of my love life /.
um and both of them were incredibly loving /.
my first husband i think was just especially unprepared for someone who had such extreme mood swings you know so much joy and the other side of that was so much sadness /.
and does it go away in a minute /?
it must be exhausting for anybody around to not know who you 're going to be next /.
in a minute we 'll ask linda what happened to bring it to a head , how she turned a corner /.
linda hamilton /.
want more information /.
you can go to www dot complete wellness approach dot com /.
we 'll ask how that works too /.
do n't go away /.
have a twin sister /?
i do have a twin sister /.
is she bipolar /?
i ca n't talk about that /.
it 's her mental illness or not /.
is she still acting /?
she 's not an actor /.
she 's a nurse /.
oh really /.
she doubled me in a couple moments there /.
yes she did me a favor /.
got a sense of what it 's like /.
are you close /?
she 's a dear heart /.
yes we are very /.
what was the turning point of you /?
did you get so low that /-
what happened that you got wellness /?
i lost two marriages /.
um and i had been misdiagnosed or sort of half diagnosed with depression years before /.
um i do n't even know that there was a real antidepressant in those days /.
nobody mentioned that as a possible for me /.
but i finally did go on medication for the depression /.
and then of course like it 's just an interesting phenomena that people that have mental illness will not stay on their medication /.
they start to feel a little relief /.
and then they /-
we 're not programmed to take pills if we start to feel good /.
we feel good /.
and all the sudden we do n't feel that we need the medication anymore /.
and that happens at least two times out of three with people on medicine /.
i first took myself off thinking that i was through the critical period /.
and then i went through a total tale spin chemically and really just could not get up off the couch /.
i had two young children /.
and i did not know how to get up at night to put them to bed /.
so who did you turn to /?
um my family doctor was a tremendous help /.
he had given me some medicine to have in my drawer if i ever decided i wanted to go that route /.
i decided not to go that route but to work with exercise and nutrition /.
and i was largely successful for a year and a half /.
but it was six hours of exercise a day /.
i mean it was so much /.
compulsive /.
yes another compulsion because those endorphins made me feel better /.
well let me see what i can do /.
i was so resistant and i think like a lot of us afraid that the best part of me is going to be dimmed and dulled and suddenly i would n't know how to act anymore /.
but you know when you really are a candidate for the medicine and need it there are n't any real side effects /.
you need it /.
and um /-
so what made you go back on regular /?
well when i realized that it was costing me too much to just keep myself in a normal place every day /.
what other people call normal i would have to climb there every single day /.
any difference between depression and bipolar /?
is there any depression /?
i mean are they the same /?
i mean any different /?
no they 're not the same at all /.
uh bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings severe mood swings /.
and it can um go through cycles where you are in the manic stage then in the depressed stage for months on end /.
is depression /.
it 's a high , right /?
could be manic /.
but when you 're manic you know you 're almost hearing voices /. it 's incredible /. and um it 's often misdiagnosed because nobody goes to their doctor and says hey i feel incredible , i can solve all of the world 's problems /.
give me five minutes and a team /.
and we 're th- you know /.
but the drugs have been amazing like lithium and others have been amazing /.
balance /.
alright what 's the complete wellness approach /? it 's an incredible feeling /.
but nobody goes complaining to their doctor about that /.
true /.
to just create that equalizer and balance is something i never knew about /. /.
the complete wellness approach is a campaign that was started by eli lily and company um in conjunction with the university of medicine and dentistry in new jersey /.
ah a team of health care professionals led by a wonderful woman named betty breeland has developed a treatment /.
um going around teaching teams to treat people with mental illnesses with the whole body /.
there 's a big gap that needs to be bridged /.
people are treated from here up or here down /.
and so because they are not being looked at for their overall health a lot of people are dying prematurely /.
so this is just a real basic common sense approach /.
more water more exercise free tips and resources to help people with mental illnesses um uh choose healthier lifestyles dealing with nutrition um so that if there are side effects from a drug that is working for them but there is a weight gain /.
you know that can be devastating for someone with um depression or a mental illness /.
but this is just a campaign to sort of help doctors caregivers um treat the whole person not just the mental illness /.
why do they live less /?
well um i would venture a guess that is um lack of energy to -- you know /.
they 're so busy dealing with their heads /.
i like to say about myself and most of my life that it was all about me and it was still loud and crowded /.
there was no time for me to see you know what my place in the world was and what else i might be doing for myself because it just took everything to get through the day /.
for want of a better word do you feel cured /?
i feel that i am managing my mental illness /.
still have it /?
yes i think that i need to remember that it is there um that there are certain things that i need to do /.
i really want to um stress that there 's no magic pill for everyone /.
that 's why i ca n't sell medication /. there 's no such thing as a pill that works the same for everyone /.
the pills have been an amazing story though /.
um for me yes /. but for me it was a combination of twenty years of hard work and looking um exercise /-
for me it is just necessary to exercise /.
i 've got this huge busy brain /.
i need to go and sweat for an hour and do my weights for a half an hour or an hour /.
not every day /.
it 's no longer the compulsion /.
but i just know that that helps me feel better /.
more water just water for sodas just simple approach /.
but we can get people living longer healthier lives yeah /.
and when you contact the website you get more information /?
um tools and tips about how to bring some better health into your life questionnaires that you can pull down that you can take to your doctor about your general health /.
and so it 's just about being your own advocate and um you know trying to collaborate in your whole body health /.
you said how your general practitioner helped you /.
a lot of them are not knowledgeable in this area , are they /? true /. are you dating /?
which is why you know if this information is out there /-
it 's the age of information /.
and we need to just get as informed as we can about what other things might help us live healthy lives /.
nope /.
you sound happy about that /.
you do n't want a relationship /?
i think i 'm over the urge right now /.
i 've got so much relationship with my children /.
i do n't want to parade men through their lives /.
i have two very whole relationships with my ex-husbands /. you still see them /?
all the time /. we are a tribe you know /. we have found our way /-
are they friendly your two ex-husbands /? to work on behalf of /-
completely /.
so /.
that 's great /.
if i 'm out of town and there is a crisis husband number two calls husband number one /.
and i feel that it is a tremendous victory that we have all been able to get together and be healthy /.
how about acting /?
there is that coming up i hope /.
i 'm um just getting ready to do a character arc in a new show for fx called beef /.
you were beauty and the beast /. and /-
i was /.
we 'll take a break and come back go to your phone calls /.
i was /.
for linda hamilton that website is www dot complete wellness approach dot com /.
do n't go away /.
that 's with ron pearlman and beauty and the beast /.
good show /.
why 'd you leave that /?
oh /.
pregnant with my son /.
ah just joined us it 's linda hamilton /.
going to go to your calls /.
she is a paid advocate for complete wellness a whole person treatment approach that considers both the emotional and physical health of persons living with severe and persistent mental illness /.
the complete wellness approach is sponsored by eli lilly in partnership with the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey /.
the website for complete information is www dot complete wellness approach that 's one word dot com /.
we 'll go to calls for linda /.
scottsdale arizona hello /.
first of all linda you look phenomenal /.
hey thank you /.
and i 'd like to get ms. hamilton 's take on tom cruise 's statement of zero medications towards uh any mental or physical illness /.
thank you larry /.
k /.
i think that it would be arrogant to say that something is bad for everyone /.
um i think that it would be very irresponsible to deprive a lot of people of the hopefulness of a treatment um any more than i could say that my medication works well for everyone /.
you know it is a very individualized thing mental health /.
and i think that the words that should be banned from this english language are you should do this or you should never do that /.
you know i think we need to remain flexible and allow you know people to deal with their own mental conditions with their doctors and it 's none of our business /.
right true true /.
well i am very careful with um you know toe the line /- i tend to go the other way and say that whatever you can find that works for you you should embrace and hold on to and just make it work /.
boulder colorado hello /.
hello hi first i want to say i really respect your coming forward to help others about this and i think that 's a wonderful admirable thing /.
i 'm wondering what advice you have for spouses of someone with a mental illness particularly someone who is n't currently diagnosed , how to avoid misdiagnosis , just what can i do to help my husband and make sure that he does n't go through what you went through and uh any advice /.
well i think it must be a very scary situation to be with someone you know needs help /.
i can tell you that the things that helped me most were the friends that looked at me and said we love you and we know that you can not help who you are being right now the way that you 're acting , that you can not control your behavior /.
but they um you know embraced me and let me know that they were beside me and behind me and that possibly i should just look a little further for some answers instead of jumping all over me and condemning me for my bad behavior /.
um you know i did have a group of loving and supportive friends who said we 're going to see you through this and you need some help and let 's keep looking /.
it 's hard though to be close to someone who is screaming at you /.
absolutely /.
or who is not talking or who is in a depressed state and locking the door to the bathroom and staying in there for fourteen hours /.
ah /.
i mean i have to tell you that when i married my first husband bruce i went into hiding for the first year /.
i just started reading books /.
i mean the man married me /.
and i went into hiding for a year /.
i still do n't know what that was about /.
but imagine being a newlywed and having a wife that just disappears in the bedroom reading science fiction fantasy novels for a year /.
you know um you ca n't really explain what a depression is or where it comes from to someone that does n't understand /.
but if you could offer him um the freedom and the kindness to go and talk to somebody and seek the help and keep seeking the help that will help him a lot /.
redwing minnesota hello /.
hi ah hi larry hi linda /.
hi /.
hi /.
and i just wanted to say you are such an encouragement /.
i am currently trying to find out the mood swings and the anger and the shoving people away /.
but you are such an encouragement /.
and i am so very glad you are out there in our face so to speak and letting us know that people will support us /.
and i 've got such a fantastic fantastic husband /.
he 's my hero /.
what 's your question /?
oh i 'm glad for you /.
i just um wanted to say how long approximately it took to find something /.
did you have to try several medications /?
you know it 's a little scary /.
but i 'm very encouraged by you /.
well yes /.
um i wish you the best /.
i just want you to know that i have such a compassionate heart for people that are going through this /.
and i think it 's important to know that you 're not alone , that there are millions of us and that we 're all sharing the burden with you right now /.
um i was lucky in that the first medication that i found worked for me /.
it was a huge fear of mine that it would n't work and that i 'd have to be a pin cushion and try this one /.
i mean the first time i talked to a pharmacologist and he tried to put me on this and said well if it does n't work , we 'll take this off and then we 'll put you on this i was like no thank you and left you know because i was so afraid that that would happen /. but you 'll be on it the rest of your life /?
but um i 'm getting better every year /.
i mean i 'm still getting better /.
you know i 've been on medication now for eight years /.
and every year is just richer and richer because i 'm really returning to who i was meant to be , who my parents raised /.
yes /.
you accept that /?
in the bipolar phase when the swing is high you must feel terrific /.
i accept that and um renounce it /.
totally terrific /.
and it could swing low in an hour /?
it can you know /.
um i used to say it would be like walking down a street and falling into a manhole cover you know an uncovered manhole and then you know just like disappearing /.
all of the sudden i would disappear /.
and then i could n't find my way back up /.
the smallest thing /.
back with more calls for linda hamilton /.
do n't go away /.
that was from a nineteen eighty - two film her first film acting with her first husband bruce abbot /.
ha ha /.
that was titled tag the assassination game /.
ha ha /.
i never heard of this movie /.
neither did anybody else /. what was it whoever tagged who first /?
oh ah right /.
tag you 're it /. yes it was actually based on a college game that was really um wildly famous at the time yeah /.
how old were you there /? dart gun /.
you 're like a little child look younger /.
kallabassas california hello /. how old was i /?
i was about twenty - five maybe mhm /.
hi um i thank you larry so much um for having linda on your show /.
um i 'm a therapist in kallabassas specializing in mood disorders /.
and linda i just want to tell you that um there is nothing better that you can do for individuals that are struggling um with the diagnosis /.
there is um a lot of shame /.
and when individuals like you take the time to do what you 're doing um being so authentic and open it just destigmatizes it /.
not only that but the information that you 're giving /.
i 'm learning from listening to you /.
um i 'm uh incredibly touched by what you have to say /.
and um you were talking about your children and how it is at home /.
and i just wondered if you had any more suggestions for parents who may have children that /-
you know sometimes they 're misdiagnosed with add /.
and i do n't want to get off the topic /.
but just anything that you could say to parents that might be struggling with children going through this process /.
well i think the best uh that anybody can do and i sort of offer this to anyone is to just start the dialog with your children um talk to them about their moods and how they really feel /.
you know you have to watch the behaviors too and see if they you know seem to be keeping something back /.
but just start the dialog /.
i guess because i grew up depressed you know i remind my children every day that there is absolutely nothing that ca n't be talked about and solved with the right team of people but they have to be willing to speak because i think the secret keeping and all of that shame compounds over the years and then you have such a huge amount to get through with someone /.
so we just encourage open dialog in our family so that we can um attack everything together and they feel supported no matter what comes up /.
since the gene is there do you watch your children /. and do you get a little worried at the first thing that looks wrong /?
that 's normal /.
uh yes i do /.
yes i do /.
it is normal /.
tacoma washington hello /.
yeah you 're on /.
yeah you 're on /.
yes linda um um i do n't know if i 'm on or not /.
ok /.
uh first of all i 'd like to thank you for stressing the fact that when you feel good you do n't take your medications /.
and uh i found that to be true /.
i had training in mental health and also worked in drugs and alcohol in a women 's prison and found that there are so many women in prison who have that same problem in terms of bipolar and were self medicating and they 're in prison for a great amount of time and when they are released then they go off the medication if they are on it /.
and it 's just so important for you to bring up these subjects /.
and it is so sad to see so many women /.
my question is is there any work being done to help those women who are in prison /?
um you know i 'm not qualified to answer that /.
i would hope so /.
um i 'll look into it /.
i know you will /.
ha ha uh ha /.
you use /-
but um you know there is just a huge general population out there that needs help /. and although i 'm not encouraging people to take medicine , if they are on a medicine that works for them rule number one is to stay on that medicine /.
you used alcohol /.
did you ever use other drugs /?
um yes all of them /.
um i mean what i 've been through /-
but yes i was a cocaine addict /.
you 've beat everything /.
you 've /-
you know i mean i do n't want to sound like i 'm bragging /.
but you know i /.
sorry mom and dad too /.
you beat everything /. ever tempted /?
are you ever tempted /? uh but /-
yeah /. but i 've done them all /. and you know i do n't know how i managed to get through my life /. i am so lucky that you know the powers that be were looking after me /.
no no it is a wonderful gift that i am no longer tempted /. again that 's www dot complete wellness approach dot com /.

hello /.
hi i 'm bipolar /.
and i 've been hospitalized /.
and i 've been through about every medication that there was /.
um and i 'm on medications now that work but have a lot of side effects /.
and i was just curious if you 'd had that same problem /.
what kind of side effects /? um side effects /.
do you want to be more specific /?
weight gain /?
mhm mhm /.
um well weight gain which i 've taken care of i 've got that under control but like um my thyroid /.
um my hormones have gone through the roof /.
i 'm thirty - two /.
and they tell me that now i 'm menopausal because of the lithium making my hormones go up so much um /.
but the lithium is what helps you , right /?
and /-
ah /.
it does /.
um that along with another drug are the main things that control the mania /.
um the depression is the hardest thing though /.
um the medication that i 'm on for depression is just /-
um i 've been through them all /.
we 're running close on time /.
what about side effects /?
what do you recommend /?
um /. and /- you know i would recommend to anybody going on a medicine that they learn of the side effects first so that they can combat them because nothing 's worse than finding success with a medicine and then gaining a lot of weight /.
so what you want to do is learn of the side effects early so that you can do certain things for yourself to combat them /.
um and that 's really between you and your doctor to try to find your way through um those side effects /.
i mean you know what a terrible thing to be menopausal /.
if that means no children in your future that could you know have a devastating effect /.
but you should know all these things going in and then just take them one at a time with your therapist and work on them trying to find that balance /.
thank you linda /.
what 's your new tv series coming up /?

ha ha ok /.
tomorrow night rod stewart /. monday night colin powell robert downey jr. sharon stone /.
anderson cooper off tonight /.
but that does n't matter nah because erin brown is here and there 's that fam- /.
tonight the legendary mike wallace /.
and this time he answers the questions on everything from the indictment on the cia leak investigation to the president 's new supreme court nominee /.
and he 'll take your phone calls too /.
mike 's next on larry king live /.
before we talk to mike wallace about his new book let 's check up on the supreme court appointment with senator sam brownbeck republican of kansas /.
he 's a member of the judiciary committee /.
he 'll be voting on the senator /.
he voted for confirming john roberts /.
senator chuck schumer is a democrat of new york member judiciary /.
senator schumer voted against the robert 's nomination /.
and in boston is david gergen white house advisor to presidents nixon ford reagen and clinton professor of public service at harvard 's jfk school and editor at large /.
us news and world report will start with david /.
it 's a safe bet that sam brownbeck is going to vote for him and charles schumer is going to vote against him /.
and the question would be why do n't they both wait until the hearing /?
ah because we 've just come through such a contentious period on harriet myerrs and i think that the conservatives really wanted a hard right conservative and now they 've got him /.
they 've all come out and forced a celebrated /-
pat robertson called it a grand slam home run /.
and just as predicated i believe the left is going to come out on the attack /.
i think we 're heading toward a donnybrook /.
it 's going to be really interesting to hear what these two senators have tonight to say about the prospects of a filibuster /.
senator brownbeck do n't the confirmation hearings count /?
or is it over for you /.
he 's got a yes vote /.
the confirmation hearings do count /.
and it 's not over for me /.
i want to see how this nominee performs /.
i want to see what he has to say /. i just heard his name this morning just started to look at his qualifications his background /.
i think he looks pretty good /.
but i ca n't give you an up or down yes or no now /. that 's part of the process of advise and consent to get more information /.
senator schumer same question for you /.
is it a down automatic /?
no not at all just as sam said /.
on this we agree /.
um we have to see who this nominee is /.
we have to study his record find out uh what he thinks /.
we 'll meet with him personally /.
and then there will be the hearing /.
so you do n't make up your mind /.
obviously people have inclinations /.
my guess is sam 's a little happier with the nomination than i am /.
but neither of us would state our position because we do n't have one /.
you ca n't be sure until you really meet the nominee and see what they 're like /.
uh david gergen if it got to a filibuster how harmful would that be to government /?
well if it gets to a filibuster and i think that 's a very close call tonight whether it will eventually get there or not and the republicans then have made it very clear that they would likely invoke the nuclear option /.
and that is to kill the filibuster and to kill filibusters in general /.
and then we 're going to have tribal warfare in washington /.
we may not get there larry /.
a lot depends /.
uh the hearings do matter /.
people have to look more closely at the record /.
but i think both senators are i think exactly right to say we 're going to wait and hold our positions /.
you can tell by the way the activists on both sides are lining up that this is going to be a donnybrook /.
senator brownbeck you said that bush picked the best person he could find when he nominated harriet myers /.
does that mean that litos is second best /?
well uh i do n't recall saying that /.
i 'm not sure where your producers came up with that particular statement /.
they came up with it /.
i did n't /.
well huh ok i 'm not sure that was probably attributable to me /.
i had a lot of questions about harriet myers a lot more about /.
there was a lot less of a record on her than there is on judge litos /.
this is one i think we 're going to know a lot more about /.
and i think this is good for the process /.
we should know a judicial philosophy /.
we should have outstanding candidates put forward /.
i think everyone agrees this is an outstanding legal mind /.
and now let 's look at the judicial philosophy /.
i think he probably is a little more conservative /.
he 's probably not as far to the right as ruth bader ginsburgh is to the left /.
uh but let 's take a look /.
and it 's going to take some time to see /.
speaking of that senator schumer did you want a woman /?
well all things being equal yes i would have preferred a woman /.
i believe in diversity /.
but uh the president made his choice /.
and sam and i do agree on one thing larry /.
and this is sort of interesting /.
we both agree that the nominee should state their judicial philosophy give us some idea of how he or if it were to be a she thinks on these issues /.
i think the days of the stealth nominee which harriet myers clearly was is over /.
you know supreme court justices have tremendous tremendous power over every one of our lives /.
and the only time you really get to question them see what they think is when the senate has its confirmation process /.
we agree that that ought to happen /.
it ought to happen in a dignified way /.
it ought to happen in thoughtful way /.
but it certainly ought to happen /.
he wo n't make the court if approved until january , right /?
well i think that 's true /.
and you know that 's one thing that does worry me /.
because of the importance of this nomination there should n't be a rush through the procedure /.
some were saying let 's get this done very quickly /.
that does a disservice /.
judge alito is fifty - five years old /.
he 's likely to be on the court for several decades having a huge effect not only on us but on our children maybe our grandchildren /.
and we ought to be careful and thoughtful above all /.
no rush here /.
should n't be /.
david gergen on this program bill clinton said that often judges disappoint the presidents who appoint them because it 's the first time in their life they have a job where they 're not appealed and they also see things differently /.
ah that 's true /.
i do not think that 's the case in this instance because judge alito does have a long record /.
he 's got fifteen years on the court of appeals /.
uh and the one thing we do know about him is that he 's had some forty - one dissents on that court almost always to the right of a court that has been fairly liberal /.
uh and i think he has a consistent philosophy /.
larry hmm the president deserves to be congratulated for now putting forward someone again who has experience and who is talented /.
there 's no question about that /.
he appears to be quite genial /.
i 'm sure he 'll do pretty well in the hearings /.
my sense is that this is ultimately going to come down to the question is the senate going to confirm someone who is going to be a reliable conservative and probably be voting consistently with scalia and thomas or will the democrats be able to block that /?
and that 's a very big important battle over the judicial philosophy that ought to guide the court /.
senator brownbeck could he be a reliable conservative and still vote to uphold roe vs. wade /?
well i think one could probably look at that /.
but i think that 's an unlikely way to consider it /.
roe vs. wade the right to an abortion that 's read into the constitution is not in the constitution /.
uh and there 's a number of commentators from the left and right that agree that this is not in the constitution /.
it should be debated /.
it should be dealt with by legislators across the country /.
so i think he could read it that way /.
but it seems to me unlikely on somebody that would be more of a strict constructionist on the constitution /.
but he could uphold just on precedent , could he not /?
because he has said in the past that he favors precedent /.
i think almost every judge and justice favors precedent the role of starry decises that once a law is settled it 's settled /.
you know you look in our history /.
we 've had a number of cases in the supreme court that have been overturned by later courts /.
and thank goodness they did /.
brown versus board of education is in my home state of kansas /.
it overruled earlier laws that said segregation was ok /.
thankfully the court overturned those prior decisions /.
chuck schumer do you expect a battle /?
well honestly let me just say i would have hoped that we could have avoided a battle /.
do you honestly expect it /?
i would have hoped that the president would choose a real consensus nominee who would have much broader support /.
but i think what happened here is not a single senator for instance said that uh harriet myers ' nomination should be withdrawn /.
sam may have been on the edge /.
but i do n't think he ever said it /.
it was only these very extreme groups that said it /.
and the president went along with them /.
and you know i got to tell you this larry /.
i ca n't tell you what will happen with judge alito /.
i think it 's very close as david gergen said /.
but any president who seeks to govern whether it 's court appointments or anything else from the extremes democrats from the far left extreme republicans from the far right extreme it does n't serve the country well /.
and it ends up not serving themselves well /.
david gergen you have a prediction /.
or too early to tell /?
too early to tell /.
watch what some of the more moderate democrats do /.
watch what olympia snow susan colins and lincoln chaffey do on the republican side /.
those are going to be the swing votes /.
and it 's just way too early to tell /.
uh i think he 's reliably conservative /.
i think the issue becomes as the country gets to know what some of the individual decisions are whether the country is going to welcome this or not /.
i think it 's just too early to tell /.
i think it 's going to be a fight for both sides /.
thank you senators brownback and schumer and david gergen /.
tomorrow night ambassador joseph wilson /.
former president jimmy carter on wednesday /.
and senator john mccaine on thursday /.
and mike wallace is next /.
do n't go away /.
it 's always a great pleasure to welcome him /.
he 's with us on my birthday /.
he shared a lot of my life /.
and i love him /.
and he 's my favorite personality of all time /.
he 's mike wallace /. corresponding too /-
yeah you are /.
oh larry larry larry /.
for cbs news sixty minutes since its premiere in nineteen sixty eight /.
he was there from the get - go /.
he 's earned numerous awards including three duponts and three peabodies /.
and he 's got a terrific new memoir out including a dvd from clips from some of his most favorite interviews /.
the book is between you and me /.
there you see its cover /.
a terrific read /.
before we get to the book a couple comments on matters of note /.
mike what 's your read on samuel alito /?
you had two very articulate guests on just ahead of me /.
i do n't know much about the man /.
do you /?
nope /.
he looks like an amiable fellow /.
but really i just do n't know /.
and i gather that he does not like to be called scalito as in scalia /.
for whatever reason i do n't know /.
you do know by the way on the subject of roe and wade and so forth that his mother said oh no he 's definitely against abortion /.
hmm /.
he 's a nice catholic boy /.
and he does n't believe in abortions /.
now what 's your read on the libby indictment /?
well that 's sad /.
it 's sad /.
and what it does is it brings the vice president into play /.
you know something /?
there 's been very little talk lately uh about dick cheney /.
uh he 's kept his own counsel /.
he 's been very quiet about it /.
who knows what he told scooter libby /.
uh and i believe i saw it today on cnn that there is a great group of anti dick cheney people now that has grown in this country and that they do n't like the fact that he 's so unaccountable /.
you do n't see him on the air /.
he does n't answer questions /.
um who knows /?
anyway what do you make of news people being involved /?
tim russet may testify /.
june miller goes to jail /.
well look /.
you know something /?
we get more and more deeply involved in the things that we cover /.
we have a tendency to do it /.
you do it /.
people talk to you off the record /.
you have confidential sources all the time all kinds of people who talk to you /.
so uh have you been subpoenaed /?
no /.
have you ever been subpoenaed in a like similar case where someone said something to you that you may have reported or not reported /?
yes and we tried like the dickens to stay away from it /.
pardon me /.
on the westmoreland case when we were on trial for libel in the amount of a hundred and twenty million dollars and uh we had done an hour and a half show called /-
what the dickens you know something /.
this head is getting a little bit older /.
do you have trouble with your memory /?
yes !
you do /?
the older we get the harder it is /.
it is /.
it 's a fact /.
how about your hearing /?
harder but not as hard as memory though /.
memory is tough /.
and your glasses your eyes /?
they 're not terribly worse /.
but i 've worn glasses /-
see mike /.
you 're the guest ok /?
alright /.
so you went to court over westmorland /.
in fact you told us in the past that added to your depression /.
yeah that 's true /.
that 's what started the depression for the first time /.
i did n't realize what was happening /.
but to sit in a cold and drafty federal court room being called thief liar cheat etc by the /-
the uh plaintiff had first crack at me /.
and to sit there and listen to that kind of thing /.
believe me /.
all of the sudden i could n't sleep /.
i began to believe that maybe i was guilty /.
ha it really was funny /.
alright tell me about this unusual book a collection of memories and interviews a great memoir that also has a dvd /.
give me the history of the book /.
well first of all had you read it /- i mean level with me /.
i told you /.
i told you off the air i 've read it /.
i did n't hear the dvd yet though /.
you did n't hear the dvd /?
no /.
you know something /?
first of all did you like the book /?
i said i love the book /. it 's more than interesting /. find it interesting /?
really /?
well look at your career /.
look at the people you 've talked to /.
how could it not be interesting /?
the wonderful is that uh over the years /-
can you imagine back in nineteen fifty - seven being able to talk to eleanor roosevelt /?
and do you remember a man by the name of um here we go westbrooke peggler /?
ah used to read him and hate him all the time /.
read him and hated him /.
that 's correct /.
well i quoted to her in this interview back in nineteen hundred and fifty seven i was on abc at the time /.
and what he had said about her /.
and what a vicious unpleasant lying etc etc etc /.
and she enjoyed it so much /.
talk about a soft answer turning away red /.
i hope you have that maybe available there , that you have n't seen it /.
no i have n't seen it /.
i 've read it of course /.
yeah i know /.
uh i do n't know if you 're going to be able to play any of these things or not /.
there was um /-
what i used to do larry was occasionally make speeches as you know cause you 're making them all the time /.
and you show up /.
and you want to do a new speech something new give the audience something to chew on /.
but that gets to be a pain in the neck after a while /.
so /.
and it 's a very lucrative way to get from here to there /.
in any case what i used to do was set up a big screen in the hall /.
and then i would lead into something from uh you know the people that i had had before /.
great idea /.
and maybe do five different people in the course of an hour questions and so forth /.
well um it really was good /.
the people at the uh publisher heard about it saw it and said hey somebody 's got a hell of a book /.
boy were they right /.
let me get a break /.
we 'll come right back /.
as we go to break the book is between you and me /.
and here are some clips from the dvd /.
watch /.
and that 's definitely how it started /.
she 's a great mutual friend /.
and she 's a terrific lady /.
that was tough though , was n't it /?
that was tough /.
and you were the guy who straightened it out for me /.
in fact we 'll show the audience how we did that /.
watch how we straightened it out /.
and i called her the next morning /.
and we patched the whole thing up /.
i know /.
well we both adore her /.
we both adore her very well and admire her immensely /.
she 's such a special lady /.
why did n't we read her well years ago /?
how do you mean /?
i mean in the office /.
she had that fire lady kind of image in washington /.
oh well he listened to her /.
her husband listened to her /.
and she got involved in politics more than we know /.
and when she wanted to get rid of donald reegan /.
remember when they used to live in that little branch house /?
yeah /.
i got to tell you /-
have you talked to her lately /?
uh about a month ago was the last time /.
i hope i 'll call her tomorrow and we 'll have dinner /.
give her my love /.
uh the fact of the matter is that uh she 's been having some trouble with her back /.
yeah i know /.
and she fell /.
yeah she fell and /-
well she 's an adorable woman /.
in any case /-
oh are we going to hear this now /?
no you 're not scaring me though there 's something you know we do n't know mike /?
what are you talking about /?
i mean about nancy /.
like you seem troubled /.
well no not troubled /.
look /.
she 's not a child anymore /.
and you i know feel the same way about her /.
she 's one of my favorite people on the planet /.
i know it /.
i know /.
mhm /.
now let 's get a break and come back with more /.
we 'll take calls too for mike wallace /.
the book is between you and me with the dvd /.
and that rhymes /.
and we 'll be right back /.
great moment in the book /.
that 's clint hill the secret service man when the kennedy assassination /-
what was that like for you /?
oh look /.
the anguish in that man 's heart /.
if we could see a little bit more of that i 'd be grateful /.
he believed that he was responsible for jfk dying /.
and i forget exactly how we got to talk to him /.
i believe it was seventy - five /.
yeah it was /.
and all of the sudden he began to /-
i mean listen to some of this /.
we do n't have more of it /.
but it 's a /-
and that /-
how much of it 's on the dvd /?
it 's about three minutes long larry /.
uh he really believed that he was responsible /.
he had a nervous breakdown and so forth /.
mmm /.
had it on the air /.
happily happily /.
huh /?
looks like he had it on the air /.
that 's correct /.
he was feeling that way /.
the book by the way is between you and me /.
the dvd comes with it /.
incredible with this incredible career that you have never interviewed george w. bush /.
i 've never met him /.
how come /?
never met him /?
when he was governor of texas i went down there to do a piece on um tort reform /.
and rove made up his mind that uh we were on the wrong side of that issue /.
and i did n't know him then he said mr. wallace you 're not going to talk to the governor /.
we know that your mind is made up /.
so we 're not going to let you talk to him /.
ok so we did the piece anyway /.
uh what happened then was when he came to the white house i figured well come on /.
the time has come /.
i mean i 've talked to every president since abe lincoln and every first lady since martha washington /.
uh reminds me from time to time /.
but seriously uh he just said forget it /.
you 're not going to talk to him /.
and i have never met forget talked to george w. bush /.
did rove give you a reason /?
after /.
forget the tort reform and governor /.
did he give you a reason when he was president why you could n't interview him /?
karl rove does n't like me ha which of course makes /-
because /?
who the dickens knows /?
who knows /?
i have no idea why /.
well you know that this is the tightest white house going as far as uh really talking candidly is concerned uh and the most secretive if you will /.
both the president and the vice president they do n't like the press /.
and they particularly do n't like people who might ask uh interesting questions or abrasive questions or whatever /.
people do n't know this /.
but we did this in interview a long time ago in miami /.
you were offered the job of press secretary by richard nixon /.
indeed i was /.
and you know something /?
i was offered the job as press secretary to richard nixon /.
and we got along like a /.
and i 'll tell you who i really got along with was patricia nixon /.
really /?
oh she was a lovely woman /.
and i travelled with him because he was thought to be a loser so he was happy to you know have me come along with him and the kids julie and tricia and pat nixon /.
and uh she was obviously a bruised woman because of the way that that whole watergate thing was coming down /.
and um that 's one person i really really wanted to do an interview with /.
but she was scared /.
she would n't do it /.
probably the least known first lady /.
that 's correct /.
and a lovely lovely woman /.
you know it was gloria steinam i believe that called her plastic pat /.
yeah /.
the least plastic individual that i 've ever met /.
we 're going to go to calls for mike wallace and take a break /.
and uh when we come back the book is between you and me /.
and here is mr. wallace with mr. nixon /.
what a life /.
wallace wallace wallace mike wallace /.
the book is between you and me with a dvd accompanying it /.
terrific read /.
toronto canada /.
we got to some calls /.
hello /.
hi there mike /?
yeah /.
uh first of all i just wanted to say that uh uh when i first came to canada here i got my political education watching those cbs broadcasts /.
ah /.
with uh walter cronkite and charles uh kerald and eric severide /.
um it was a great broadcast /.
course /.
i got to tell you when i um joined that group cronkite severide kerald and so forth that was like being admitted to the mother church /.
ha ha /.
what 's the question sir /?
ok actually i had this question before you started uh talking about uh karl rove /.
uh you had mentioned uh that you find it rather uh odd i guess the silence of dick cheney or maybe not so odd but he has been silent /.
but i find it uh not only bizarre but uh just unfathomable how george bush has been silent about karl rove /.
he does n't talk about him much , does he mike /?
he does n't talk about him at all /.
does n't get asked about him /.
we know that it was rove who helped to make him a governor and who helped to make him president /.
and uh would n't it be wonderful to find out more about what rove had to do with all of the stuff that we 've been reading about /?
well we know he had something to do /.
he 's named in the indictment /.
but he 's not indicted /.
that 's correct /.
yeah /.
bakersfield california hello /.
hello between you and me you gentlemen continue to make a major contribution to the citizens of this country /.
so i 'd like the two brains that i see in front of me to answer this question to which i 've been unable to find an answer /.
if we truly even for a moment believed that there were weapons of mass destruction why did we send in ground forces /?
thank you /.
you mean rather than what /?
if we believe there were weapons of mass destruction why would we send in ground forces /?
oh i see /.
why would we put them at peril /?
you know something /?
uh listen that 's a good question /.
very good huh uh /.
and what they did was as you remember /-
and i was astonished when i saw that they /-
you remember shock and awe /?
yeah /.
the united states attacking iraq and telling the world that we were going to shock and awe the world with the attack that we were going to make on /-
i mean and it was george tennet was it not who said it 's a slam dunk /.
yep /.
that there were weapons of mass destruction there /.
that 's a good question did we put our boys male and girls and women at peril /.
mhm /.
hello hello jay georgia hello /.
ah thank you larry /.
and mike i loved your book /.
it was great /.
and toward the end of the book you said secretary putin of russia had asked you to come over and interview him /. had you done that /?
uh and i 'd like to know about it /.
thank you so much /.
yeah /.
i did interview putin yes /.
on the sixtieth anniversary of the uh end of world war two he asked me to come on over and interview him /.
and it was carried uh in a lot of places /.
but i tell you something /.
putin to my way of thinking who calls himself a democrat /-
he 's not our kind of democrat /.
but i have admiration for him /.
i think he 's an honorable man /.
well he 's done a very good job for russia /.
and he 'll be fifty five at the end of his second term /.
and he said he 's not going to run for another term because it would be destabilizing not going to ask to change the constitution /.
i asked him almost as a joke uh uh i tell you what why do n't you go into journalism /?
money is good /.
age does n't make a heck of a lot of difference ha ha /.
he looked at me like i was crazy /.
but who knows /.
did n't you find him as i found him easy to be around /?
putin /?
yeah /.
oh absolutely /.
very good idiomatic english /.
he spoke on camera in russian /.
but uh i admire the man /.
me too /.
we 'll take a break and be back with more of mike wallace /.
this is a great book between you and me /.
it 's hard to forecast things in life /.
this is going to be a major best seller /.
do n't go away /.
the prophetic malcolm x /.
topeka kansas with mike wallace /.
the book between you and me /.
hello /.
good evening /.
hi /.
i 'd like to ask mr. wallace if he 's ever turned down an inter- /-

and you said no /?
if so i do n't remember /.
no i do n't think so /.

from nbc news in washington this is meet the press with jim russert /.
our issues this sunday the war in iraq tensions with iran and the future of this woman our guest the secretary of state condoleezza rice /.
then will there be a white house staff shake - up /?
and what is at stake in the two thousand six midterm elections /?
insight and analysis from david broder of the washington post elisabeth bumiller white house correspondent for the new york times charlie cook of the national journal and john harwood of the wall street journal and cnbc /.
but first as we begin the fourth year of the war in iraq we are joined by the secretary of state /.
welcome back madame secretary /.
good morning /.
nice to be with you tim /.
very disturbing headlines in the papers yesterday the russians helping iraq /.
and this is how it was captured in the paper /.
russian officials collected intelligence on us troop movements and attack plans from inside the american military command leading the two thousand and three invasion of iraq and passed that information on to iraqi leader saddam hussein according to a us military study /.
the intelligence report which the study said were provided to hussein through the russian ambassador in baghdad during the height of the us assault warned accurately that american formations intended to bypass iraqi cities on their thrust towards baghdad /.
the reports provided some specific numbers on us troop units ' locations according to iraqi documents dated march and april oh three and later captured by the united states /.
have you told the russians what is going on /?
well we 're trying first to make sure we understand fully what the documents say /.
uh these are documents that were found uh in iraqi stores /.
and obviously tim we would take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done uh maybe to the detriment of american forces /.
and so uh we will certainly raise it with the russian government /.
we want to uh take a real hard look at the documents and then raise it with the russian government /.
but these are us documents a us report /.
yes /.
you believe the report /.
oh i certainly think there is uh a lot to this report /.
but we really have n't had a chance to look at the documents in uh detail /.
intend to do that and then to raise it with the russian government /.
i would hope the russian government will take it seriously /.
will there be an investigation as to who leaked the information to the russians /?
well we 'll just have to see /.
i do n't want to get ahead of us /.
but obviously we take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done at the beginning of the war /.
that would be a quite serious charge /.
could it have been deliberate misinformation /?
i do n't know /.
i think we really have to take a look at the documents /.
we 're finding thousands and thousands and thousands of documents /.
and uh we 're going to find some important and uh surprising things in these documents /.
i think we have to step back take a hard look at the documents /.
but we will raise it with the russian government /.
when we first went into iraq we had some unexpected encounters with fedayeen /.
and we lost uh dozens of american men that russians may have been responsible for american deaths /.
well i do n't want to try hypothetically to know what impact this might have had /.
i think the first thing we need to do is take a good hard look at the documents /.
and then we definitely want to raise it with the russian government /.
and again i would hope that the russian government uh would take it seriously and give us a serious answer on what they find /.
back in june of two thousand one the president said he looked vladimir putin in the eye /.
he got a sense of his soul found him to be very straightforward and very trustworthy /.
does the president still believe that president putin is straightforward and trustworthy /?
i really do think that the russians have generally done what they said they would do /.
they said they were going to oppose the iraq war and they did /.
and they told us that from the very beginning /.
uh so i do n't have an argument there /.
and i do n't want to jump to the conclusion that this was something that was ordered out of the kremlin /.
we have to look at the documents /.
we have to go to the russian government /.
but i would hope that the russian government would take seriously uh any suggestion uh that they may have passed uh data to the iraqis uh at the advent of the war /.
but the russian ambassador is the source /.
how could putin not have known /.
and how could it be straightforward and honest for the russians to help saddam hussein /?
tim we have to get to the bottom of the facts of this /.
we will most certainly raise it with the russian government /.
i 've said several times it 's a serious matter /.
but uh i do n't want to jump out ahead and start making accusations about what uh the russians may or may not have known /.
this is something in a relationship that we have with the russians that really is candid and where we do talk about difficult things all the time , where i think we 'll be able to talk about this and talk about it uh honestly /.
why wo n't the russians help us get sanctions in the united nations against iran and try to stop them from developing nuclear weapons /?
well we 're not yet at the stage where we 're seeking sanctions /.
uh what we 're doing now is uh we 're seeking a presidential statement that would make clear to iran the international community 's determination that it live up to the obligations that everyone thinks iran has /.
we 're working through it /.
uh we have the same strategy here /.
we have the same uh view of the problem /.
the russians do not want a nuclear weapon in iran either /.
it 's been very clear in everything that they have tried to do in the way that they set up the civil nuclear cooporation with bushehr in what they offered the iranians that the russians also do not believe that there should be enrichment and reprocessing capability on iranian soil /.
and uh enrichment and reprocessing capability is the core here /.
if you 're able to enrich and reprocess then the ability to build a bomb is there /.
and so we and the russians uh the chinese and certainly the europeans have the same view of what is to be prevented /.
uh yes we 've had some tactical differences on how to get there /.
but uh i talked with my russian counterpart uh on friday /.
we agreed that our people would go back and work very hard this weekend and we 'll see where we are on monday /.
um we 're considering whether it might be a good idea to um after we have a presidential statement uh get ministers together again uh with the the p five the permanent five of the security council plus germany uh to talk about charting a course forward because everybody takes very seriously iran 's intransigence and iran 's unwillingness uh to do what the international community is uh determined that it will do /.
it is the policy of our government that iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon /.
tim iran can not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon /.
that is the view of the international community not just the united states /.
this article is in the new york times /.
the reality is that most of us think the iranians are probably going to get a weapon or the technology to make one sooner or later an administration official acknowledged a few weeks ago refusing to talk on the record because such an admission amounts to a concession that dragging iran in front of the united nations security council may prove an exercise in futility /.
the optomists around here about the white house just hope we can delay the day by ten or twenty years and that by that time we 'll have a different relationship with a different iranian government /.
that seems like a much different policy /.
well since i do n't know who this anonymous person is i ca n't tell you what relationship they may have to the policy /.
i 'll tell you who does n't think that /.
i do n't believe uh that /.
i do n't believe that the president believes that because we 're doing everything that we can to uh send a strong signal to the iranians that they have no choice /.
if they wish to be a part of the international community they have no choice but to give up ambitions that could lead to the technologies that would lead to a nuclear weapon /.
uh if the international community stays really solid here iran can not stand the kind of isolation from the international community that for instance north korea endures almost by choice /.
we really do have a chance to solve this diplomatically /.
but tim i would be the first to say we ca n't afford to waste time /.
that 's why we need our people in new york to really work toward this first phase /.
we need to see if that has an effect on the iranians /.
and if it does not have an effect on the iranians we need to move to the next phase /.
which is /?
the next phase is uh to look to uh further uh options in the security council /.
for instance perhaps the chapter seven resolution /.
which is /?
chapter seven resolution essentially gives uh the un or the security council the ability to compel a state to act /.
uh it can um say that there would be consequences if actions are not taken /.
including military /?
well uh no one ever takes anything off the table /.
but i believe we 're a long way uh from that /.
we have the possibilities of financial measures that could be taken uh bans against travel /.
there are a lot of uh options once you 're in the security council /.
that 's why it was very important to get this uh iranian dossier to the security council and why the diplomacy that we 've been working over the last uh couple of years to get the europeans and the united states on the same page and to now bring the russians and the chinese along uh has been so important /.
do you believe if the president chose to embark on military action with iran he would go to congress for authorization first /?
i 'm not going to speculate on that /.
the president uh is uh clear that he keeps all of his options on the table /.
but tim i think speculating about how we might uh set up military action is n't helpful at a time when we really are concentrating on the diplomacy /.
but i want to be very clear /.
but you would n't go to congress /?
well eh tim of course the uh administration went to congress uh the last time /.
and i would just uh ask people to look at the history of how this president uh has acted /.
he has uh taken congress as a full partner in these matters /.
but i 'm not going to get into a discussion of what the president may or may not do uh constitutionally /.
let me turn back to iraq /.
the war now in its fourth year /.
and these are the grim statistics /.
us troops killed two thousand three hundred and sixteen . wounded injured seventeen thousand two hundred seventy - one /.
iraqis killed an estimated number is thirty thousand /.
hundred and thirty thousand american troops on the ground /.
when you were planning the war some three and a half years ago did you have any idea that three years into the war those are the numbers that you would be confronting /?
well i certainly thought that it would be difficult /.
um i do n't think anyone um knew precisely what we would be facing in terms of numbers /.
and look /.
every one of those deaths is uh mourned by people in the administration uh because these are families that have lost um husbands and wives and daughters and sons /.
um but we also know that nothing of value is ever won without sacrifice /.
we 're in iraq because the um united states of america faces a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war /.
and we have to have a different kind of middle east if we 're ever going to resolve the problems of an ideology of hatred that was so great that people flew airplanes into buildings /.
saddam hussein 's iraq was a threat /.
now that the /-
but saddam was not related to flying airplanes into buildings /.
no /.
and we have never said that saddam /-
uh saddam was not related to the events of september eleventh /.
but if you really believe that the only thing that happened on september eleventh was people flew airplanes into buildings i think you have a very narrow view of what we faced on september eleventh /.
we faced um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout the middle east that had to be dealt with /.
saddam hussein was a part of that old middle east /.
the new iraq will be a part of a new middle east /.
and we will all be safer /.
but madame secretary weapons of mass destruction was the primary rationale given to go into iraq /.
lisa myers of nbc news broke a story last week that the iraqi foreign minister mister sabri became a spy for the french and the cia /.
and this is how it was reported /.
saddam hussein 's last foreign minister naji sabri paid spy for +french intelligence later turned him over to the cia to supply information about iraq its chemical biological nuclear weapon program more than six months before the war began in march of oh three according {to} former intelligence officials /.
the sources said he provided information {the?} iraqi dictator had ambitions for a nuclear program but it was not active and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled although research was under way /.
that 's a far cry from what the american people were told /.
of course tim this was a single source among multiple sources /.
and the problem was that saddam hussein was unwilling after multiple resolutions in the security council to account for his uh weapons programs /.
uh we all remember that the accounting of the un uh weapons inspection mission that was supposed to uh look into its weapons program could not account for large stockpiles /.
we all thought that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction /.
he certainly had a a very healthy appetite for them /.
and he had used them before both against his own people and against his neighbors /.
he was a threat /.
this was someone shooting at our aircraft as they flew the no - fly zone /.
he 'd invaded his neighbors /.
but the point is that now that he 's gone iraq has an opportunity to be a different iraq in a different kind of middle east /.
i know it 's hard /.
and i know that the numbers that you 've put up are difficult to see /.
and i know that the violence on tv is difficult /.
but i would ask people uh to look at the perspective here of what is really going on in iraq /.
uh under the specter of this violence you have iraqis now sunni shia kurds and others determined to form a government of national unity /.
that 's extraordinary in iraq 's history where they 've always settled their differences by violence not by politics /.
and when they succeed in that uh they are going to have the basis for a very uh different kind of iraq /.
and i think they 're going to succeed /.
but people are being asked to take your judgement on this as we sit here this morning and refer to previous judgements the administration made /.
weapons of mass destruction there were none /.
we would be greeted as liberators /.
this is three years later /.
that it would not take hundreds of thousands of american troops to occupy iraq /.
tommy franks according to the book cobra two said we 'd be down to thirty thousand troops in november of oh three /.
the cost of the war the budget director of the white house said it 'd be fifty billion dollars /.
it 's now over three hundred and fifty billion dollars /.
each judgement has proven to be wrong /.
the judgement that has not proven to be wrong uh tim is that the region is changing in fundemental ways and the region is better without saddam hussein /.
yes it is true that uh everyone thought he had weapons of mass destruction /.
he did not /.
it is by the way the case that the iraqis are delighted to be rid of him /.
and uh most iraqis in fact uh are willing and uh want to keep coalition forces there until they can uh take care of this themselves /.
but we do have to keep things in historical perspective /.
these people are doing something that is quite unknown in the middle east /.
and one has to ask what was the alternative /?
was the alternative to leave saddam hussein in power uh continuing to threaten his neighbors continuing with his uh windfall profits from the oil for food scandal continuing to repress uh his people and build mass graves uh continuing to uh use those oil for food profits to again build the infrastructure for his weapons of mass destruction /?
but many will say he was contained by the no - fly zone /.
ah i do not think that he was in a box /.
he was in a box /.
the oil for food program alone shows that the billions of dollars that he was collecting /-
he was not just going to build palaces /.
this was someone who had an insatiable appetite uh to dominate his region /.
now without saddam hussein you can look across the region and see that uh a lot is changing thanks to the president 's democracy uh promotion and the hard work of people in those countries /.
you have syrian forces out of lebanon /.
you have uh saddam hussein out of uh iraq /.
the people of the middle east are taking on authoritarian governments across the middle east /.
kuwait has given women the right to vote /.
i 'd be the first to say that these big historical changes are turbulent and they 're difficult /.
but the notion that somehow there was a placid middle east , that if we just left it alone , if we 'd just not invaded iraq , if we had just not overthrown dictators , if we {had?} just not challenged syrian power in lebanon everything would be just fine uh is simply not true /.
it was that middle east the malignancy of the middle east that we quote unquote disturbed that led directly to the september eleventh event /.
the president said this week that whether there 'll be troops in iraq for the unforeseeable future will be determined by the next president meaning we 're going to have troops in iraq at least through january of oh nine /.
oh the president was asked this question in a particular way /.
and he answered that uh some american troops may well be there for the next president /.
but i would just point to what uh the president has said continually which is that american forces are going to come down uh commensurate with the need as iraqi forces stand up /.
and they are indeed standing up /.
general casey has talked about a significant reduction of american forces over the next year /.
and that significant reduction is because iraqi forces are taking and holding territory now because during this most recent uptick of sectarian violence the iraqi army uh uh behaved very very well /.
so iraqi forces are getting better /.
american forces are ceding territory /.
and i think it 's entirely uh probable that we will see a significant draw - down of american forces over the uh next year /.
that 's what general casey believes /.
was /-
this year /.
it 's all dependent on events on the ground /.
but as general casey has said we see the progress with iraqi forces /.
we see the progress of the political process /.
and uh there 's every reason to believe that american forces can start to draw down /.
is the insurgency in its last throes /?
well the insurgency uh politicially is certainly in danger because {of?} the sunnis who stood outside of the political process /.
but in terms of violence is it in its last throes /?
well the insurgency is still able uh to pull off violence and kill innocent children or kill an innocent school teacher /.
yes they are able to do that /.
and they might be able to do that for some time /.
but what they 've not been able to do is to disrupt the political process /.
what they 've not been able to do is to set iraqis uh one against another in the political process /.
they 've not been able to stop three elections /.
they 're not able to stop formation of uh the government /.
uh a few violent people can always uh grab headlines and can always kill innocent people /.
it 's more than a few /.
well it 's a few in terms of the population of iraqis /.
but it could not exist without being enabled by the population /.
well the population is less and less enabling every day /.
there are reports that zarqawi and al - qaeda meet stiff resistance indeed violent resistance from iraqi tribes /.
sunnis are now a part of the political process /.
and i know that people wonder when will the government formation finish /.
uh it seems to be dragging on after the election /.
but i would just note i read the other day someone said well they 're dividing up the spoils of the offices /.
that 's not what they 're doing in this process /.
they are writing a government program on which the national unity will govern /.
they are writing the rules by which they will govern /.
and they 're determining who will take key positions /.
so this is uh an extraordinary matter an extraordinary scene with iraqis sunni and shia and kurds all working together toward a unity government /.
let me turn to afghanistan /.
there 's a story moving on the wires that the afghan court has just dismissed the charges against this gentleman who had converted to christianity /.
are you aware that was going to happen /?
i ca n't confirm uh that particular report uh tim /.
i know that the afghans are working on it /.
they 've been very aware um of the issue and of the concerns about the issue /.
this is a young democracy that is uh working with a constitution that uh like many constitutions when they 're first born uh the conflicts have to be worked out /.
we have our own history of conflicts that had to be worked out after a new constitution /.
and so um the afghans are working on it /.
but america has stood solidly for religious freedom uh as the bedrock uh of uh democracy /.
and um we 'll see /.
but i ca n't confirm that specifically /.
should american christian missionaries be encouraged to go to afghanistan /?
well i think that afghans are uh pleased to get uh the help that they can get /.
we need to be respectful of afghan sovereignty /.
including christian missionaries /.
we have to be respectful of afghan sovereignty and tim respectful of the fact that this is a country that is coming out of twenty - five years of civil war a country that 's going to have to find its own way and a country that is going through one of the most difficult uh debates that any society goes through /.
and that is the proper role of religion in uh the politics of the state /.
it 's a debate by the way that all of us went through at some point in our history /.
but madame secretary we talk all the time about spreading democracy /.
and your own state department report on human rights abuses eh says that christianity is punishable by death that christian missionaries are not welcome that women can not get a passport or leave the country without permission of a man /.
this is a far cry from the responsibilities and rights given to most people who live in a democracy /.
it 's also a far cry from the taliban /.
this is a country that has come an enormous way in four years where yes the uh issues of the constitution are going to be debated in this very traditional society that is trying now to move to a modern political system /.
i would just ask people to remember how hard this was for us /.
tim i am i hate to say fifty one years old /.
but it 's in my lifetime that uh black americans were guaranteed the right to vote /.
who are we to be uh uh eh so insistent that people must do this overnight /?
we 're working with the afghan government /.
they 're moving in a democratic fashion /.
it 's going to be hard /.
but when something arises uh as with mister rahman it is the obligation of the international community and the united states and there has been support across europe for this that the afghans be reminded that in their own constitution they have enshrined the universal declaration on human rights which guarantees certain religious freedoms /.
we did n't have that constitution with the taliban to work with /.
so christians should be able to worship /?
people should be able to convert to christianity in afghanistan /.
of course tim /.
eh the universal declaration of human rights is clear on this /.
but i would have to say that afghans are going to have to work through some of the difficulties and contradictions /.
but it ca n't be done on a case by case business /.
it has to be ensured /.
they will have to work through court cases as we have to interpret the +constitution /.
they will have to work through individual cases /.
and i 'm quite certain that the evolution of afghan democracy is going in the right direction /.
but i would just remind people that four years ago the taliban was executing people wantonly in uh stadiums for playing music /.
this is a country that has come a very very long way /.
and women were not being educated uh at all /.
it was punishable to educate women /.
this is a place that has come a long long way /.
let 's support them in uh their quest to become a modern democracy /.
you mentioned you 're fifty one /.
and i 'm curious if it 's time for a career change /.
we 've discussed uh uh future options for you on this program /.
here was the headline all across the paper /.
nfl commisioner paul tagliabue step down in july /.
and here 's our conversations in two thousand one two three and four on this subject /.
in your next life you want to be commisioner of the nfl /?
right /.
i think the nfl is really a terrific institution /.
and i 'd love to be associated with it one day /.
another first /?
uh tim i 'm going off to be commisioner of nfl /.
remember /?
i think paul tagliabue 's doing a fine job as nfl commisioner /.
but um i look forward to uh the day that he decides to retire /.
and uh i very much think that the the best job in america 's got to be nfl commisioner /.
you just announced your candidacy /.
i still think the best job in america may be nfl commisioner /.
it 's a little too soon for me /.
i 've got lots to do as secretary of state /.
and i think my ship came in /.
it 's going to have to leave the port without me /.
so you 're not interested /?
no not interested /.
now fred barns a reporter uh uh has close ties to the eh sources to the white house wrote this in the wall street journal the other day /.
a third time for bush the president 's most spectacular move would be to annoint a presidential successor /.
this would require vice president cheney to resign /.
his replacement /?
condoleezza rice who mister bush regards highly /.
we 've got a great vice president of the united states in uh vice president cheney /.
uh he is uh doing a fantastic job for the president and uh for the country /.
um he is really one of the strongest uh supporters that uh i 've drawn on from time to time /.
and uh he 's doing a great job /.
i think i 'd better try to be secretary of st- /-
you just gave a whole list of things i have to work on as secretary of state /.
but if the president came to you and said dick cheney 's going to resign i want you to be my vice president because i want you to run in two thousand eight you would n't say no /.
tim ah i think we 've been through this conversation about two thousand and eight /.
i 'm not going to do that /.
that 's not what i want to do with my life /.
laura bush said you 'd make an excellent president and i do n't think we can talk her into running /.
uh well i really appreciate that the first lady who i admire very much uh thinks that /.
but the last part of that 's right /.
will not happen /.
i do n't think it 's going to happen /.
madame secretary as always we thank you for sharing your views /.
thank you very much /.
coming next , david broder elisabeth bumiller charlie cook john harwood interpret the washington political landscape tackle the issue of immigration and look at the midterm elections in two thousand six /.
right here on meet the press /.
the politics of immigration iraq and the midterm congressional elections /.
david broder elisabeth bumiller charlie cook john harwood a round table after this station break /.
and we are back /.
welcome all /.
immigration /.
look at these scenes and these pictures from los angeles /.
five hundred thousand people according to police estimates turned out to protest some of the immigration reforms that are being discussed debated perhaps legislated in washington /. david broder how big of a political issue is immigration /.
and what are the potential pitfalls for politicians as they try to navigate the issue /?
it started as a border issue in uh states that have common boundaries with mexico particularly /.
uh it has now become a national issue /.
talking to republican governor of minnesota it 's a big issue in his state /.
suburban illinois districts now find large hispanic populations /.
it has become a much tougher issue for politicians of both parties but particularly i think for republicans /.
the polling we have seen with the wall street journal nbc eighty - eight percent say it 's a serious problem /.
sixty - two percent say that illegal immigrants should not be allowed to become citizens /.
and sixty percent say that we should n't even give them guest worker status to come here temporarily /.
elisabeth bumiller you wrote a piece in the new york times quote bush is facing a difficult path on immigration talking about the joint pressures on president bush from the business community we need these people to work because americans wo n't do the jobs and the conservative community saying illegal immigrants get them out /.
what does he do /?
he 's trying to uh thread the needle and walk a very fine line between both of these groups /.
i mean inches he 's a former governor of a border state /.
so this is very close to his political experience /.
in the early days of this debate in two thousand four he was giving very emotional speeches about america the land of immigrants /.
and he was proposing what many republicans said was a very generous guest worker program /.
um he has pulled back a lot now ah under onslaught from conservatives /.
and now he 's emphasizing the border security part of his plan /.
he 's trying to do both /.
as we know there 's a lot of different proposals on the hill right now /.
we 'll see some of them next week /.
um the white house is hanging back waiting to see what comes out of the smoke /.
and then we 'll weigh in /.
charlie cook it appears that the american people have very firm views about immigration and that the president and other politicians are kind of trying to nuance the issue /.
is that possible /?
well it 's a funny issue /.
if you ask me what 's the most important problem facing the country it 's a small single digit issue /.
but then once you raise it boy emotions run high /.
and it 's hard to split the baby /.
and i can see where the president 's trying to go the let 's build a wall or build a barrier stop illegal immigration /.
but for the people we have we got to mainstream them and keep this workforce going because that 's important for agribusiness and business /.
is that politically acceptable to conservatives /?
eh it 's not acceptable to anybody /.
but it 's the only way i think /-
i mean they 're going to have to figure out a way to split the baby because one way or the other is just not going to work /.
john /?
well let 's do n't forget tim democrats are also split on this issue /.
lot of african - americans are not very sympathetic with the cause of the guest worker program /.
uh the white house elisabeth mentioned trying to thread the needle one of the things they were looking at is trying to push the final resolution of this until after the midterm election /.
that also could happen on some budget issues as well as a way of trying to make some sort of common cause between moderate democrats and moderate republicans /.
you know in two thousand florida florida florida /.
two thousand four ohio ohio ohio /.
you look at two thousand eight that electoral college map /.
and you look at states like new mexico and arizona and colorado some real potential swing states /.
and this issue could be very decisive as we play it through /.
well let 's do n't forget one other thing tim /.
this was raised in the virginia governor 's race last year by the republican candidate who went after some of these job centers that attract illegal immigrants /. did n't work for him /.
so sometimes the emotion of the issue does n't always prevail /.
let me turn to iraq the big discussion in our country about iraq the way the issue is being covered by the media /.
uh vice president cheney last sunday made these comments /.
there 's a constant sort of perception if you will that is created because what 's newsworthy is the car bomb in baghdad it 's not all the work that went on that day in fifteen other provinces in terms of making progress towards rebuilding iraq /.
secretary of defense rumsfeld weighed in /.
the terrorists seem to recognize that they 're losing in iraq /.
i believe that history will show that to be the case /.
fortunately history is not made up of daily headlines blogs on the websites or the latest sensational attack /.
and then this wednesday president bush went to a town meeting in west virginia of his supporters /.
and here 's one of the questions that was asked /.
and i ask you this from the bottom of my heart for a solution to this because it seems that our major media networks do n't want to portray the good . they just want to focus /-
okay hold on a second /.
they just want to focus on another car bomb /.
or they just want to focus on some more bloodshed /.
does that issue work that it 's the mainstream media that 's distorting the good news that 's coming out of iraq /?
i think it helps with the republican base /.
but i do n't think it helps with swing voters at all /.
first of all it 's the nature of news /.
i mean on the evening news at night a car that is n't in a wreck is n't in the news /.
a house that does n't burn a building that does n't burn a killing that does n't take place /.
news is the aberration is the change from normalcy /.
secondly uh eighty journalists so far have been killed over there /.
um i mean i mean getting out there and looking around wandering around iraq looking for good news sounds to me like a good way to get killed /.
and then the third thing is that i do n't know if they really want to try to sell this because people do n't think uh that everything 's fine /.
i think this is just an extenuation of holding the banner that says mission accomplished /.
the people do n't think it 's well /.
they can see that it 's not going well /.
and what happens in fifteen provinces does n't matter /.
if they think that this thing is just really going to hell in a handbasket um i mean you know that 's that /.
david broder /?
the ombudsman at the post deborah howell has a very thoughtful analysis of this question in the paper today which i would refer people to /.
i think the answer is that when there is this level of violence and turmoil in a country that has to be the heart of the story that the press is telling /.
the other parts of it do get told /.
but they do not dominate the news /.
and they ca n't dominate the news given the realities of that country /.
nor should they dominate the news /.
it 's a very weak argument /.
when you have as charlie said journalists over there who can not move around the country to report because they know that they 're in danger of being killed at any moment that tells you about the state of security in the country /.
it 's not good /.
the white house /?
the other thing that 's interesting what you did n't show was the president 's response to her /.
i was there that day /.
and he was very very careful not to jump on her bandwagon /.
in fact uh i mean obviously he did n't have to /.
she did it for him /.
but the point is he said look , wait a minute /.
you know um i understand your frustration /.
but um we have a free press in this country /.
we ca n't tell them what to do /.
he pulled back somewhat from her comment /.
and i think you 're right charlie that they know they ca n't sell this and when they 've tried in the past it has backfired on them /.
but the president also said do n't be afraid to go to blogs and find out some more information /.
yes i mean i mean these are gradations here in white house response /.
but is the white house convinced that in order to secure the base of the republican party for the president it does n't hurt to go after the media a little bit /?
of course not /.
they do it all the time /.
uh and they complain all the time about what we do /.
but i have noticed this past week scott mcclellan saying the white house press secretary you know we 're not blaming the media for the war in iraq /.
he said that a couple times this week /.
and so again they 're being a little more careful here than usual /.
and did you really fall asleep in that press pool /.
or was that a cheap shot by the president /?
that 's completely inaccurate /.
i wo n't say i have n't nodded off in previous speeches but not that one /.
there is a difference +between meditation and sleep /.
uh david broder let me turn to the rebellion that i sense with some house members uh particularly in the republican party when you go talk to them privately /.
you captured it in your column this way /.
the conflict over the dubai ports world brought to the surface deep - seated resentments from the capitol end of pennsylvania avenue toward the people around the president and surprisingly toward bush himself /.
the harmony that had prevailed during most of bush 's tenure the deference that a republican controlled congress has generally shown to his wishes disappeared /.
even the normal circumspection with which congressional republicans treat the white house withered in the heat of this dispute /.
and then this /.
congressman tom davis of virginia a committee chairman told the post this is probably the worst administration ever in getting congress ' opinion on anything /.
ouch /.
well you had heard this kind of comment all of us had privately from republicans on the hill /.
but the fact that somebody like tom davis former chairman of the republican congressional campaign committee is saying it publicly on the record uh gives you a measure of the sort of fall - off of any sense of either loyalty or intimidation whatever you want to call it to the white house /.
uh they uh feel that they 're on their own and that the president is going to take care of his business but they 're going to take care of their own /.
one of the things being talked about elisabeth bumiller is the staff shake - up at the white house /.
this is how you reported it /.
republicans outside the white house say that had pushed mister bush uh not to replace karl rove the chief uh political operator deputy uh chief of staff but rather to bring in someone at the same level or above perhaps as minister without portfolio /.
one republican said mister bush should view it as replacing a top - notch pitcher struggling in the later innings of a baseball game rather than as a vote of no - confidence in a friend /.
so who 's the reliever /?
well there 's lots of names that they /-
you 've heard them as well as i have /.
ed gillespie uh you know bill paxon /.
there 's lots of names /.
um the question is are they going to do it /.
and right now there 's a lot of talk at the white house /.
there 's no indication that the president has signed on to this idea /.
karl rove has told people that he thinks that bringing somebody in without a clear line of authority is a mistake /.
and uh the bottom line is is this going to help with the war in iraq /? you know you know we 're not talking about changing policies here /.
we 're you know changing you know some personnel /.
so that 's /-
it 's unclear if anything 's going to happen /.
john /?
well chances are pretty good something will happen /.
the president of course did n't rule out the idea of bringing someone on /.
bill paxon 's a possibility /.
vin weber 's also a possibility /.
and i think over time you could see some changes in the white house staff as well /.
when you look at sort of the big three or the biggest names in the white house andy card karl rove dan bartlett you could see some change over time /.
andy card probably the most likely to leave at some point /.
he 's almost uh already the longest serving chief of staff ever /.
you could see some change there /.
on the verge of dethroning sherman adams of dwight eisenhower fame /.
you bet /.
uh let me turn to the midterm elections where all these things +invariably lead /.
here 's our latest numbers in the wall street journal poll right track wrong track /.
united states headed in the right direction twenty - six percent /.
one of four /.
sixty - two percent say wrong track /.
and the so called generic question who do you want to control congress /.
republicans thirty - seven percent /.
fifty percent now a majority say the democrats /.
but as always charlie cook is warning of us to go slow /.
and here 's his latest column from the national journal /.
despite national political trends indicating that the gop is in serious trouble a race by race micro-analysis suggests that democrats can not easily seize control of the house or senate this fall /.
in the senate democrats need a net gain of six seats /.
democrats need to win in tennessee where bill frist is retiring have to run the table by defeating all the most vulnerable republicans while holding all of their own seats including in minnesota where their incumbent is retiring and in washington state where senator maria cantwell faces a very strong challenger /.
they also need to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in maryland and vermont as well as fourteen other incumbents /.
although not impossible in a favorable political climate this is a very tall order /.
and here are the vulnerable states according to the cook report /.
uh vulnerable senators conrad burns in montana lincoln chafee rhode island mike dewine ohio santorum in pennsylvania jim talent missouri and the tennessee seat /.
charlie what do you see in the senate /?
you know when you look at this election from the big picture the national numbers boy just looks horrible /.
and it looks like gosh republicans will be lucky if they hold onto anything /. and then you do the race by race like this /.
now the thing is the first three or four for democrats probably are n't that hard /.
but when you get to the fifth and sixth seats you get to winning in ohio and talking about the tennessee open seat /.
gosh that 's hard /.
i mean it 's going to take a real real real strong wind up their backs /.
and it 's the kind of thing where there 's structural barriers /.
i mean eighty - five percent of all incumbent senators get reelected /. and you 've got to knock out five of them /?
now it can happen /.
but it 's hard /.
and it 's kind of like having uh structural barriers that are out there that are protecting the republican majorities /.
and if this is a category one two or three hurricane those barriers are strong enough /.
but if it 's a four or five they 're not /.
and the question is how tall will it be /.
and tim some of those races can change overnight in a hurry /.
conrad burns has now got a primary challenge from a significant republican /.
there 's some talk among republicans that maybe conrad burns would find something else to do maybe in the bush administration /.
that could change in a hurry /.
charlie you also say this about the house /.
in the house where democrats need a net gain of fifteen seats only about three dozen are truly in play today /.
so it 's tough /.
and you have to get an inside straight /.
right there 're basically twenty - four republican seats that today are vulnerable /.
democrats have to win fifteen out of twenty - four and hold on to their eleven the toughest ones /.
and again they can do it /.
if there were more republican retirements in tough districts , if uh /-
but redistricting and the incumbency advantages that have built over the years just make pulling this kind of win hard unless it 's a category four or five /.
well in nineteen ninety - four you talked about micro-changes thirty to thirty - five seats in the house /.
and the tsunami came /.
republicans won fifty - two seats uh electing newt gingrich speaker of the house /.
newt gingrich has now weighed in david broder and said that the democrats ' slogan in two thousand six should be had enough /.
and he thinks that would work /.
what a helper gingrich is /.
uh i think the democrats ' real slogan may very well be would n't you like to have somebody watching the store because the sense that i get from talking to voters is that they are not ready to entrust the government to the democrats but they 're not really comfortable with the way the republicans have been running things /.
and the simple idea of having a little oversight uh little checks and balances back in the system is potentially a really powerful argument for democrats /.
elisabeth bumiller when the white house hears little oversight checks and balances to them it means hearings with subpoena power /.
and they do n't like that /.
that 's right /.
no no /.
and you know karl rove has told people he 's optomistic they can hang on to both houses um uh if /-
but he also has said yes it can happen the way charlie cook says /.
and you know you 're going to see the pre- /-
the president 's out a lot these days campaigning already raising money for candidates /.
and uh he 's out in all these big states /.
because the last thing the white house wants is investigation into weapons of mass destruction and to prison abuse and to religious rights in afghanistan /.
drop the issue /.
and there 's a hearing /.
i mean that 's the last two years of the bush presidency then /.
and they know that /.
that 's true tim /.
but let 's keep in mind first of all keeping republican majority is not the top priority for this white house /.
winning the war in iraq is the top priority /.
and secondly it might not be the worst thing to happen to george w bush if democrats had a weak majority /.
you could see some deals cut especially on entitlement programs the last two years if democrats try to resolve a problem before they hope they get a president in two thousand nine /.
david is it enough for the democrats to say we 're not the republicans period /.
or do they have to come forward with a specific proposal to deal with these problems including iraq /?
well if they 're going to be responsible they need some policy /.
and the great void on the democratic side is nobody can tell you today what their policy is about iraq about entitlements or about any of the other challenges facing the country /.
whether they need that politically somebody else is smart enough to decide /.
but if they 're going to be a responsible party they need to talk about policy /.
do they need to do it /?
see i would argue that minority parties do n't have to be responsible /.
that 's the one good thing going for them /.
and when they try to be responsible they 're just going to dig themselves into a hole /.
i mean your job is to throw rocks /.
once you start offering alternatives then suddenly you 're playing defense as well /.
i think democrats would be crazy from a political standpoint to offer up proposals /.
that movie cool hand luke sometimes nothing 's a real cool hand /.
exactly /.
elisabeth afghanistan a very thorny issue for this president uh who is uh very open about his christianity /.
and now we have the situation where it appears this gentleman who converted to christianity in afghanistan has been spared the death penalty /.
but it 's an ongoing issue as secretary rice seemed to indicate as that democracy in afghanistan goes through some serious growing pains dealing with religious rights women 's rights civil rights human rights /.
right well this is what happens when you call for democracy in problematic parts of the world /.
we saw this in the elections in the palestinian territories obviously /.
what do you do when you call for democracy and the wrong party wins in your view /?
this was also going on in afghanistan /.
um the president was ver- /-
you know you saw him this week saying this was deeply troubling /.
um it would be interesting to know what was going on behind the scenes and what kind of pressure was put on afghanistan our good ally /.
um obviously uh uh it looks like they got out of this one for now /.
john uh harwood secretary rice openly talking about american troop withdrawals /.
how much are politicans expecting to have significant troop withdrawals before the midterm elections /?
i think republicans are definitely expecting it and that could change the political environment /.
that 's one of the biggest drivers of this wrong track sentiment that we 've been talking about this morning /.
uh but eh as uh uh david discussed democrats do n't exactly have a clear voice /.
they 're going to try to finesse it this week and have an event drawing together all factions of the party criticizing bush and calling for some sort of transition without specifying exactly how it 's going to take place trying to have an umbrella under which those who want to withdraw troops quickly and those who want to go more slowly can all rally behind /.
is n't that the republicans ' hope david that by october enough troops have come home the president can then give a speech that says you see /.
we 're making progress /.
stay the course /.
do n't take a chance by going on with these other guys and doing something dangerous /.
if that happens the republicans would benefit /.
and the country would benefit /.
and uh let 's just hope that it 's possible /.
charlie cook politically will that be enough to deal with people 's anxieties concerns about iraq /?
that would help a lot /.
i mean your nbc wall street journal polls show that iraq was just a wet blanket over the administration /.
it was weighing everything down /.
and these republican members one of them told us he comes in for the tuesday uh house republican conference lunch and he can tell who 's just gotten a poll back that they have this shell - shocked look on their face /.
somebody else said ashen /.
one other member said suddenly they start going into fundraising frenzies because they 're getting polls back in their individual districts that are starting to reflect those national numbers that look so horrible for them /.
it 's march madness for congressional republicans too tim /.
i 'll tell you that /.
speaking of march madness you 're a duke man /.
who do you like now /?
boy i 'm rooting for george mason /.
that 's the uh underdog pick right now /.
the patriots /.
charlie /?

i 'm from shreveport louisianna /.

georgetown 's out /.
so i 'm for lsu /.

i 'm better than that /.

elisabeth bumiller john harwood david broder charlie cook we 'll be right back /.
do n't forget /.
you can now watch the entire hour of meet the press whenever wherever you want /.
our meet the press webcast posted each sunday at one pm eastern on our website mtp dot msnbc dot com /.
that 's all for today /.
we 'll be back next week /.
if it 's sunday it 's meet the press /.
do you ever watch dateline nbc /?
yes /.
have you ever seen our stories on computer predators /?
yes /.
this is one of them /.
um , this is the first time i 've seen you , and i 've always wanted to ask you a question .
ah .
usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads .
oh .
oh ! i had n't thought about that .
actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n't it ?
do you have to shave it every day ?
right , yes .
um , when i 've slept so much i ca n't wake up , i just shave my head and i 'm awake .
and do you need to polish it somehow ?
then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?
oh , after i shave it i rub on a little oil .
is it cold in the winter ?
pretty cold .
do you wear a hat ?
in the winter ?
it forces me to wear a hat .
that 's a question i 've always wanted to ask .
um , i 'm sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying director ye daying who has shot such and such , they ca n't avoid the cliche , they always have to say " i 'd like to introduce marshall ye ting 's grandson . "
your father , ye zhengming , was marshall ye ting 's second child . right .
oh !
but today we 're telling ye daying 's story .
let 's start with when you were young .
when you were young you were very naughty .
ye daying was born in changchun in 1958 .
although by that time his grandfather ye ting had been dead for 12 years , the ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed communist household .
the next year the entire family transferred to beijing , and ye daying spent his childhood there .
he and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .
one , two , three , four .
ducks were the most precious asset in our village .
the village mayor gave them all to me .
the mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ; he had me check to see that there were none missing .
but i never did count them all carefully .
77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 did you see ?
are there 86 of them ?
yes . ye daying 's mother , an qi , was an educated woman who worked at the changchun film studio .
and his father , ye zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .
because after the wannan incident ye zhengming and his father ye ting were imprisoned for two years in a kuomnintang prison .
but then , and for the same reasons , just after the cultural revolution started , ye zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .
that year ye daying was just eight years old .
his family 's sudden misfortune left the young ye daying with very disturbing memories .
he changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .
from that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .
ye daying just corrected us ; he said that ye ting should not be called marshal ye ting but rather general ye ting .
right , right , right , general ye ting .
why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?
um , he died in '46 .
that marshal , afterward , after liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --
ok , we 'll call him general ye ting .
mm .
because ,
very naughty ?
to what extent were you naughty then ?
in fact i was a very well - behaved child . but i was , forced into it , , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive .
what do you mean forced into it ?
during the cultural revolution , , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .
so the kids then did n't want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing .
mm .
so you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,
why was that ? was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such .
right .
so it was because of that sort of thing ?
right , the majority of it was like that .
mm .
mm .
because you had to face them alone , ok , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .
you had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .
so that was , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand .
mm .
were you tough ?
mm .
very tough .
tough enough to --
because , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , , how could you manage .
you were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal .
mm .
, i remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --
those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .
i did n't dare defend myself , so i just had to endure it for quite a while .
mm .
finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , and i got angry , so angry that i rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel . where did the shovel come from ?
from digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right . mm . so you picked up the shovel and rushed them .
did you crack somebody 's head open ?
mm , anyhow , yes , i cracked their head open , it was very tragic .
all of a sudden nobody was making a sound .
very --
once i fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .
how many of them did you take out ?
i hit one of them and that was enough .
nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody 's father ?
they did , and there was a huge fuss . mm .
because when i was little , having a big fight like that .
mm .
anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years i changed school , and that 's how it had to be .
mm .
i remember one time -- mm , also , when i was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , down with ye zhengming , he was yelling at me , and i had to fight them .
mm .
after the fight i went home , and my father was standing far away .
, the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters down with ye zhengming , , the slogan .
mm .
i got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when i think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .
mm .
back then i felt , looking at him standing so far away --
i walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n't understand anything .
at the time i felt like i had a grievance .
and i felt , i was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and i was fighting them . in fact that 's the way kids think .
mm .
you think , you bastard .
what you say does n't count .
you come after me and i 'll take you down .
you come down , and i 'll take you down .
if you have balls , you come on down .
come on down .
come down .
come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .
i say you take a whack .
whack .
i 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?
, you 've already handed him over .
i sent someone .
ok , ok , i sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .
come on , take a whack at me .
take a whack at me . your dad knows who broke the window .
take a whack .
take a whack .
take a whack .
are n't you willing to be friends with us ?
yes , i am .
he says he 's willing .
did you hear ? he says he 's willing .
ok , that 's all right , let 's go play .
this is a movie directed by ye , called there 's a place called wangjiazhan .
wangjiazhuang , right .
this is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .
right . right .
which child is you .
is this child you , or is that child you ?
actually we should be accurate ; this child 's experiences ,
so this child ,
um , right , right , right , because once , i
my father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see . mm .
they denounced my father , so i was very indignant ,
they let a lot of people expose my father ,
mm . then the day after i took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that i 'd hack the guy up .
a kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .
oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .
then i was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up .
but i had already said it .
what did you say ?
said i have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child .
but , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n't understand this .
if you do this , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?
in fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .
i could not lose the face this way , , so then i ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself .
was it all ruined ? the door --
i slashed it twice .
um , was n't there any consequence ?
mm , there was no consequence , , i just let the adults reason with me .
mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .
it , had a great influence on me .
including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you .
more or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .
mm . mm .
, the reason i like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .
mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in beijing .
what year was it that you moved to shanghai ? how old were you at that time ?
, in '69 i was 11 years old .
mm .
mm , well .
in '69 at the age of 11 you went from beijing to shanghai .
mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed .
mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .
i went there every day and then they suspended classes , , so i could n't go to school , could n't go to class .
mm .
so , later i remember there was -- mm . a guy in the engineering team , and he brought quotations from chairman mao and said to me , he said , now take this , now take these quotations from chairman mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
a lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?
right , but the problem --
because , i had never studied well ,
in 1966 the great cultural revolution came , and at that time ye daying 's family moved from beijing to shanghai to live .
his father ye zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .
and the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of ye daying 's life .
he was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .
when you got to shanghai the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?
after i got to shanghai , , settling into , , that ,
all that time , from '69 to '76 , i graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .
mm .
at that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?
right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .
what kind of people were in your class ?
um .
anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .
mm .
all of them , and every day i went there , and the classes were suspended , , so they did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class .
mm .
so , afterward , i remember there was mm . a guy in the engineering team , and he brought quotations from chairman mao and said to me , he said , now take this , now take these quotations from chairman mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
lots of fun .
mm .
so i was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .
in fact it was n't that we did n't study , i think it was ,
this class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life i think about this ,
mm . that period was both a happy and a fun time . because i was a good egg .
in this i go against the grain . um , the thing is , , they 're all the same .
if you 're bad , you do what you want , and so , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free .
plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free .
i think that --
um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n't all necessarily bad kids .
mm . they just were n't like normal kids .
, it was like a brotherhood .
ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .
mm , we helped each other .
very sincere , very sincere and good .
when he was in that class , ye daying received patient teaching every day .
at that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .
this girl became the only light in ye daying 's dark life for several years .
in those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?
um .
when i was a school kid , for example , um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , i liked her .
mm .
i always felt , um , she can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .
and then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .
mm .
it was ,
so already you could -- go see a movie ; i thought ,
that was it , that was it .
you just want to go see the movie , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --
so you went to the movies with this girl ?
yes .
do you still remember what movies you saw ?
the flower girl .
i still remember that now .
mm .
she cried as hard as she could .
so seeing the flower girl was the equivalent of seeing titanic now .
oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .
yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .
at the time i thought i would n't cry .
but the people all around were crying , and i thought if i did n't cry it would look bad .
so then you cried .
so then i thought , i should let my emotions go .
um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?
, now i remember that she was very pretty , mm .
mm .
she was a very good student .
ha ha , this --
how was it she liked you ?
at that time we did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,
gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye .
, so , when we were in class , for example you ,
i remember how it happened , yes .
um . when we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .
mm .
mm .
so then , we 'd each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . and throw spitballs .
i threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .
the result was that she turned her head to look .
and she looked at you angrily .
i thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .
i thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling . mm .
that 's how it was , i should say .
it was like that ?
mm .
many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and i was still going to see her .
mm .
the --
, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .
you graduated from middle school in '73 .
'74 . mm .
graduated from midle school in '74 .
mm , that female schoolmate went to the shanghai suburbs to live and work .
right , right , yes .
ye daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?
mm , when i started it was a technical school .
then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .
mm .
mm .
41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .
it was a lot of money .
in 1976 , there were two happy events in the ye family .
the first was that his father , ye zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .
the second event was that ye daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .
with the turn for the better in his father 's political circumstances , ye daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .
in 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of ye daying 's age were thrilled .
however , at this time ye daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .
you thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?
oh my , in fact , '78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .
mm .
mm .
up to then , um , i had never thought about the future .
mm .
i thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -lrb- factory -rrb- worker .
in society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .
um , in '78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .
at that time , in '78 , i was 20 .
a lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?
right , but the problem was , , because , i had never done well in school .
so right off i felt that i was finished , --
those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .
mm .
so i was hopeless , right off i was feeling down .
very clearly a --
if you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you 'd get .
i did n't take the exams , i did n't have the nerve , i did n't try , so --
, the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .
mm .
mm , i had n't thought , , that i would work in the movie . mm .
, um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend 's house .
mm .
so then i --
one day she sent me to deliver it , and so i picked it up and read it , and once i read it , oh ! the directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and i thought wow ! this is just the ticket .
let 's run off to try and see .
i thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , i want to be a director .
no , i did n't , no .
it was just because there was no english exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .
right , it was very simple .
mm .
one more thing , because in '78 , the beijing film institute was recruiting students in shanghai --
right .
so , ye daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n't pass the exams .
his mother , an qi , had never thought that ye daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the beijing film institute .
but ye daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .
although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left ye daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do .
the next year , 21 - year - old ye daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the xi'an film studio .
being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .
at that time you especially admired directors , right ?
mm , because after i got to the xi'an film studio , um , i discovered i had the shakes when i got on stage .
mm .
mm . now , here chatting with you , i feel , um , it does n't matter .
even today , in front of the lens , i 'm a nervous wreck .
mm , very tense .
did you act then ?
of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .
i thought , this is definitely not working .
just getting on stage gave you the shakes .
then , , no , it was n't my thing , this , i could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,
um , it was in '80 that i went to the xi'an film studio ,
mm .
at that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .
and i 'm not that kind of person , so i could n't get my bearings .
so then at the same time when i saw that teng wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .
mm . mm .
that projecting force of his , i thought wow , , that 's really good .
he could really project .
because ultimately , there , i gradually realized this .
mm . and i would be in the audience and see him directing on site . mm .
mm , i could see how they worked .
in fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , i thought it was really a bunch of fluff , i thought , that 's really fun , that 's really interesting .
i thought who was stubborn , then i wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n't mean i knew anything about that profession .
so no one ever came looking for you to do a play ? at that time --
mm , no one ever came looking -- .
they looked , but it was always just for an extra .
, you did n't even have any lines .
mm . that xi'an incident thing , i played an extra once .
there was a guy playing zhang xueliang , and i played his secretary going in to report to him , and i did it a few times but i was always in the wrong place . what were your lines supposed to be ?
it was " reporting , a telegram " that sort of thing . so you --
so i had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .
so after i gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .
so the old director , cheng yin , um , mm .
he would say , this is an qi 's son , why is he like that ?
do you remember how many takes you did ?
oh , a lot . i think it was something like ten plus times .
it was too , i 'd walk badly and turn like that .
, i attended that class for half a year , um , um and then i got sick .
um , i got , , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .
your whole body was paralyzed ?
right .
your whole body was paralyzed ?
right . i was paralyzed for ten months . so you could n't move at all . i could n't move at all .
when it started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then it started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly i could n't move .
what 's the scientific name of the disease ?
it 's called guillain - barre syndrome .
it 's named after a foreigner .
mm .
ahem , if naming it somewhat common , it 's , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , it goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then it turns into myasthenia .
and how did you get better , later ?
hormones .
you took hormones .
um , , every day i had a transfusion .
mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .
mm .
very fat . i 'm so fat now , but compared to then it 's much better , in fact . at that time how fat were you ?
yah .
getting so fat , it was this , if i looked down i could see my own cheeks , so i thought i was really fat .
what do you mean ?
if i just look down , my cheeks are right here .
but after they finished with the hormones , i gradually got better .
mm .
the flesh all atrophied , um .
if you look at when i was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --
later , based on that , it all evaporated .
i 've heard it said that that wang shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --
sometimes , oh , right .
mm . get some fun . get some fun .
the language in that , the part wang zhiwen played , the disease he got is about the same as your disease , is n't it ?
right , right , right , right .
so sometimes , oh , it was me and wang shuo , together , it was , um , in '89 .
mm , together , um , wrote a -- .
aye , the script i wanted , the novel he wrote , um , that piece we created together .
mm .
therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , , more or less that story , as background .
mm .
then after i went back to beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , i saw wang shuo for the first time
then , when i saw him for the first time , wang shuo was holding a book in his arms , a book , that was floating on the sea , that novel he wrote , it was a sample . mm .
gave it to me , and i took it back to school to read .
i read it and wow , that day , i thought he would be able --
our generation could really find ourselves , i mean --
um , in the end i knew we --
why we studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one 's own kind of thing is the most accurate person
ye daying had already read wang shuo 's novel love the hard way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on him .
he sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .
later he was introduced by a friend , and ye daying met the author of the novel , wang shuo , at the film institute .
that was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .
how many plays did you collaborate on ?
in june of 2004 , the shanxi yongji peasants association was formally established ; it now has 3,800 members .
accordingly , this is the first peasant organization to be legally registered and designated a peasant association since the founding of the prc . its president is zheng bing .
she says that two years before that they were already calling themselves a peasant association .
at the time the association was just set up , it ran into an issue . it really tested the association 's ability to deal with problems .
the school built a classroom building and put a lock on the gate door .
they invested more than 400,000 ; although they were poor , several hundred family heads made a ruckus .
the secretary telephoned , can our association get involved and resolve this matter .
i myself put up 1,000 yuan , and with 19 people we put together 10,000 yuan , and we went to negotiate with the contractor .
in the end , the contractor came around and let the kids go into the classrooms to attend classes .
the entire problem was resolved smoothly , and it greatly increased the prestige of the peasant association in the eyes of the local villagers .
but why did a peasant organization get involved in a matter that should have been resolved by the village party committee ?
will peasant associations become a direction of organized rural development ?
with these questions in mind , this reporter came to yongji in shanxi to get the scoop .
in fact i 'd heard about zheng bing 's aggressive approach early on .
but when i saw her , i felt she was someone who really wanted to be low key .
the minute i met her , she told me that what she did was terribly ordinary , and basically was n't worth our looking into .
and she spoke about her family , her husband and child , and she looked concerned and haggard .
and she would often sigh .
but when the subject of the peasants association comes up , and when talked about how she was organizing peasants and helping them improve the quality -lrb- of their lives -rrb- , zheng bing 's face lights up with a dazzling smile .
if you go 13 kilometers west of yongji in shanxi , you come to zhaizi village .
the yongji peasants association has its headquarters at the entrance to zhaizi village .
previously , zheng bing and her husband ran a chemical fertilizer store here .
now , they have donated the fertilizer store to the peasants association .
back in '97 , why did you think of giving technical training to the peasants ?
it was kind of by accident .
um , at the time , my husband ran , uh , the zhaizi technical center , on the banks of the yellow river , which provided farmer 's financial services to the peasants .
while i was helping my husband , i discovered that the peasants were investing the money to buy fertilizer in a very haphazard way .
also , many of those peasants who came into the store to buy fertilizer , they 'd come into the store , and they really did n't have a clue , and they 'd think , so - and - so is buying that , so i 'll buy that , and they basically did n't know , they did n't go and choose something based on what their own land needed .
was it easy to get teachers to come to the village to give classes ?
the first time , in fact , the first time was unimaginable .
at the time , the attendance on that day , it was n't something like that .
the first time , organizing the first time , , at the time that zhaizi technical center was seven or eight li from our village , and it was on the banks of the yellow river !
at the time i was afraid to ask the teacher to come because the peasants might not come to hear him , so at the time i ran from village to village , i went around organizing .
i spent two months running around to the ten villages that surround our village .
um , and at each village , i would go around trying to find out who had the most technology awareness .
then i 'd go to them face to face and say , we 're planning to hold a technical training ; would you be willing to come ?
finally , from the ten villages , i chose 80 women .
then i got them to bring peasants from surrounding area altogether .
were there people who could not get in to the class ?
more than 400 people came to the class that day .
so i went to ten villages , but it was n't just the 80 people , they all brought people from the surrounding area .
the class went on from just after 10 in the morning until five in the afternoon .
hey , when that class was over , many of the peasants had a lot of feedback .
hey , , the class went great .
this class earned zheng bing more than she had expected .
nearby villagers all heard about this terrific person who dug deep into her own pockets to provide an agricultural seminar for everybody . and they all loved coming to the technical services center to buy things .
the next year , this shop of zheng bing 's took in more than 60,000 yuan .
furthermore , this center of hers became an agricultural technology exchange center for the surrounding area .
whenever villagers would run into some agricultural production issue , they all liked to come here to look for answers . how many times since the end of '98 have you held similar training sessions ?
since december of '98 , each year we 've held four to six training sessions .
do you still need to provide the money for them ?
um , not necessarily . starting in '99 , because in '98 , for that one training session , i spent 1,300 yuan .
and that year , the income i counted was 4,000 yuan .
therefore if we did a training session four times a year we were n't earning as much as we had to spend .
then , in '99 , i went to our agricultural bureau , and to our municipal women 's association , because most of the people attending the training sessions were women .
when i went to our agricultural bureau , i thought , huh , the agricultural bureau has all those technical personnel , they ought to provide services to the peasants .
so , starting in '99 , the municipal women 's association was very supportive of us , and they liaised for us in getting teachers from the agricultural bureau and the water conservancy bureau .
if we invited technicians from our yongji city , it 's free of charge .
starting with the technical training , the yongji peasant cooperative organization began to take shape .
aside from attening the classes , the peasants began to make demands of zheng bing , asking her to undertake some projects .
zheng bing thereupon set up a poultry - raising project , serving as guarantor for it ; she helped the peasants take out a loan from a credit union for 150,000 to participate in this project .
did you ever think what you 'd do if they could't pay off this 150,000 yuan when it came due ?
um , at the time , i did n't think about it ; probably because i was so positive about it .
but then it actually failed , alas !
a year later , it , failed , nobody paid back the money , and the credit union came after us .
but i did n't feel any regret , i looked for the reasons .
how could it have failed ?
so the 150,000 yuan , the head of the credit union wanted to take me to court , he said , i should pay it back , and i said what i was responsible for i would take care of .
if nobody wanted to pay it back , i would gradually pay it off .
but i could n't pay it all back in one year .
then i telephoned him : given my actual circumstances , if i pay it back in six years , is that ok ?
the head of the credit union said it was n't ok , , he wanted to take me to court , he wanted to shut down , uh , my store , and even confiscate my home .
in a farming village , 150,000 yuan is no small sum .
this burdensome debt took zheng bing 's breath away .
her husband 's not understanding and blaming her added to zheng bing 's psychological burden .
with this enormous , difficult - to - bear pressure on her , she did not understand how a good thing could turn out this way , and zheng bing left home .
but because zheng bing was the guarantor , the credit union still took zheng bing to court .
but then how was it that the credit union let you go ? they did n't shut down your shop again or require you to mortgage the shop .
at the time they filed a lawsuit against me , and the lawyer also came !
after the lawyer came , he explained these things to me , he said , the credit union has already filed suit against you .
i said , well then i still can not help with it .
the lawyer asked me , from a to z , what happened ? so i explained it all faithfully .
after i explained it , the lawyer looked all astonished .
he said , i 'll go see the credit union , and -lrb- ask them -rrb- not to file a lawsuit .
so the lawyer sorted it all out .
so after the lawyer arranged it all , the head of the credit union said , finally we 've reached an agreement , and you can pay it back over six years .
so as of right now , i still have 65,000 yuan to pay .
so next year when the time expires , will you be able to pay off this 65,000 yuan ?
65,000 yuan from the start , , if i do n't provide any more services to the peasants , i can pay it off .
but the peasants need lots of services .
ho !
there 's no way to stop it .
so , i discussed it with the credit union .
they 'll defer the interest for each year .
each year i 'll give them the interest .
then they can push the six years back again .
but it 's good that they can understand and agree to do it this way .
yow ! do n't shoot , do n't shoot -lrb- the film of -rrb- me , i do n't cry .
originally i was thinking i 'd help the peasants to raise their incomes , but because of that i took on a debt of 150,000 yuan , and i got taken to court .
in 1999 zheng bing quit her job as a teacher .
however , in running the fertilizer store , she often gave credit to poor peasants , which made her to have 110,000 yuan of credit could not be collected .
zheng bing thought of a way to resolve this problem , but she absolutely never imagined that because of it she would nearly end up in prison .
selling to them on credit like that , were n't you concerned that you would n't be able to get the money back in the future ?
ho ! if i could not collect on that big amount , i was thinking how will i be able to give the peasants credit to solve the peasants ' real problems ?
and how could i keep this from having a negative impact ?
i discovered that peasants are not entirely having no money .
so then , i was thinking , could n't the peasants join up with us in this fertilizer store by becoming shareholders ?
given the seasonal nature of peasant income , they 'd have to invest about 50 yuan each time .
so then , in practice , i let the peasants invest 50 yuan for each mu of land , invest , 50 yuan .
then , after you 've become a shareholder , you can come at any time to get fertilizer .
then , at the end of the year , , we 'll settle up the differences .
and the amount you invested , if you 've invested , then we 'll take your money and buy fertilizer , sell fertilizer .
that is , the peasants bring in their own , and our store will take the peasants ' money and run , the fertilizer store .
and was n't there anyone who said to you that this approach may have been considered an illegal way of raising capital ?
yes , and i thought , this village , how come good things are so difficult to do ?
the first year i did uh , eight ; in our village i did 20 households .
it had no impact .
by the second year , i began to really deal with everybody , and they all knew , and i made it public .
good grief ! at first , , that credit union , good grief ! that service , everywhere they were saying zheng bing is raising capital illegally .
look , she 's cheating you out of your money !
if she could cheat you out of several tens of thousands and then she could leave the country !
these things really shook up our government .
our people 's bank , our association , they all came .
after they all came , they said to me , zheng bing , we need to investigate your business .
i said , why do you need to investigate ?
they said , we hear that you 're raising capital illegally .
because there , leaders of different sectors from our city , they all came here to us .
when they said illegally raising capital , i was startled .
i said , if it 's raising capital illegally , i 'll shut down right away , i wo n't do it anymore .
an accusation of raising capital illegally is not a small matter . the bank investigated the matter ,
later it was persuaded and prevented by the city of yongji . therefore zheng bing , fed up with scare , even though she was convinced that she should give up , she was really unwilling .
after thorough consideration , zheng bing made a surprising decision ; she donated the fertilizer store , with all of the profits going to pay the activity expenses of the peasant association .
essentially this fertilizer store enabled your family to earn money ; why did you want to give it away ?
because at the time everybody had become a shareholder , and once they had , it was everybody 's business .
you ca n't take everybody 's business and run it as your own , to make money for yourself .
so at the time i told my husband about this , and my husband , he did n't agree .
then do n't let everybody become a shareholder .
do n't let them become shareholders , then we 'll , be able to loan the money and get the business going .
oh ! but i felt , the peasants , they need this kind of service .
who would have guessed that my husband would be strongly opposed . i worked with him again and again .
finally , he agreed .
since then , no one is saying anymore that she is raising capital illegally .
bing zheng , who sacrificed her own profits , gradually got the peasant association working better and better .
and a thing that came next made the villagers not only see that zheng bing had a spirit of sacrifice , but her organizing skills also could instill confidence in people .
in organizing the village women , how did the dancing part come about ?
i said why could n't it be , like the women in the city , dancing in the summer .
they said what ? how can we be compared to the city ?
i said , why ca n't we be compared to the city ?
that day i went , to the women 's association , the women 's association gave us that , our yongji , invited teachers from the chunlei kindergarten .
wow !
that first time , the first afternoon , we first got together 20 - some women in our village to dance .
that afternoon we basically did n't dance a step ,
we laughed all afternoon .
laughed at what ?
they were embarrassed ! hah !
, how can we dance !
because at the time , in the courtyard of our home , the teacher was , extremely conscientious , and they were all laughing hard .
the whole afternoon , we did n't learn a single step .
but i saw that they were so , that kind , excited , and i felt , maybe this is the beginning of a new life .
so i persisted .
i persisted for a month .
just imagine , 80 % of our village , that is 120 women joined in .
after a series of women 's activities , the spirit of villagers in zhaizi village had changed .
on lunar january 1 , 2003 , zheng bing organized a large get - together in which the men participated .
there was a women 's stage performance , and the men held a chess tournament .
after that , it became popular among the villagers to call it the peasants ' association .
but in the end dancing and playing chess do n't achieve any real benefits for the villagers .
not long after , zheng bing and the key members of the peasants ' association did something that allowed the villagers to see the direct advantages of the peasants ' association .
when was the village construction council established ? why did you want to set up this body ?
our village had a reputation locally as having messy , messy lanes .
yikes ! after it rained , it was really tough to walk , so we went to the village committee .
at the time our village had a secretary who doubled as village head .
we went to see him .
we spoke to him three times , and they 'd always say no .
the reason they said no was , our village committee had no money .
we considered the village committee 's hardship ,
and the villagers discussed it collectively .
they decided to set up a village construction council , to focus on fixing up the lanes .
indeed , why were you confident that you could handle the matters that the village committee was n't able to ?
because we all discussed things together , very intensely .
because , first of all , these lanes are a matter of concern to all of us .
and if we do it ourselves , why should n't we be able to get it done ? but the fact is that you yourselves selected the village construction council .
yes .
and it 's an autonomous institution , might it not clash with the village committee ?
there were no clashes .
for the selection , we did the selection ; if our village committee wanted to do this , it had this objective difficulty .
and now this village construction council of ours , there 's nobody who has anything against it .
so there 's none of this feeling of dependency .
so it 's possible to convince every family , every household to mobilize .
because , it 's everybody agreed .
in the end , it was actually very difficult to get this thing done , to complete it .
according to a yongji official , the reason the zhaizi village peasant association has had such a big impact , one major reason is the paralysis of the village committee .
many of the things that the village committee was originally supposed to do the peasants ' association now does .
the peasants have seen that the association has safeguarded for the peasants ' interests at crucial times .
zhaizi village has a total of 263 households .
the number of households that became members of the association went from over a hundred before the lanes were fixed to more than 200 .
on june 7 of last year , the yongji peasants ' association was formally registered at the civil administration bureau of yongji city .
its legal representative is zheng bing .
in november 2004 , the first business operated by the peasants ' association after it was registered , the zhaizi village paint plant , was set up and went into production .
in the shareholding issue , zheng bing and the association members ran into a succession of problems .
for construction capital , they adopted the member shareholding approach , with a total of 300 shares at 300 yuan per share .
zheng bing 's idea was that each member household could hold a maximum of three shares .
if they could n't sell that number of shares , they 'd let the members of the board of directors and its chairman buy shares .
but they could not exceed five shares and ten shares , respectively .
i heard many people say you made an arbitrary decision , with regard to the paint plant shareholding decision .
some people wanted to hold controlling shares , but you strongly disagreed .
and you absolutely did n't want to hear other people 's opinions .
yes .
, as we were organizing , , the paint plant , right away , at the meeting , they proposed , i want to hold controlling shares .
i said what we 're running is , a cooperative paint plant .
it 's not a joint - stock company , the paint plant , because we had already announced that information in advance . so then we began squabbling at the meeting .
you ca n't do it this way ,
that way is too arbitrary .
i said , first you go home and study up on what the coop system is all about , then come back and we 'll talk .
if you think you really want to hold a controlling share , i suggest you set up a plant on paper .
your aim in holding a controlling share , is n't it to use everybody 's capital to serve your own interests ?
but a short time later , everyone again clashed with zheng bing .
there are twelve households in the village that were categorized as retarded or disabled and extremely poor households . zheng bing proposed giving one share to these households , with the capital coming from the association 's expenditures .
the 20 - plus directors and the chairman split up into seven groups to discuss the matter of giving shares to these twelve households ; not one person supported zheng bing 's idea .
but when zheng bing persisted , everyone finally agreed .
just now you repeatedly used a word , quality .
what quality is it that you 're referring to ?
every month we give the association members a report .
as we began this year , we put out a report , and , it presented a goal , to become the number one village in china within ten years .
the association is now experimenting in zhaizi village .
of course , some people ask you , this number one , what does that imply ?
i say , two things .
first , we want our villagers ' whole concept of the legal system to be the first in all of china .
second , , we want the overall cultural quality of our villagers to be number one .
we are all set to be number one in these two areas .
this is the 10 - year goal we have established for ourselves .
but if we want to achieve these two number one's_ , it 's not just that you can say it and that 's it .
you have to constantly overcome your own traditional , conservative kinds of thinking and antiquated concepts .
you have to constantly challenge yourself .
so this quality thing , it really has a lot of meaning to it .
now that she has quit her teaching job , donated away her own family store , and with the development of the peasant association , the biggest issue for her now is still that of money .
the peasants ' association does n't collect any membership dues ; the six technical service centers that belong to it give the members a two - yuan discount on each sack of fertilizer .
they also let members buy on credit and pay it off at harvest time .
so how much of your family 's own money have you contributed ?
if you really total it up , my family has paid out more than 200,000 .
for the peasants ' association , and organizing the peasants , you invested 200,000 - plus , such a huge sum , does n't that pain you ?
it does n't pain me ; i feel it 's very worthwhile .

children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city .
these are called left - behind children .
the parents are also forced to work in the city . in fact , they have no alternatives but to make such a decision .
there are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in china , thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children .
i want to tell them that i miss them a lot .
day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect .
i think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .
visit the children more often whenever possible .
-lsb- -rsb-
in september 2005 , a study report titled " concern for left - behind children " had drawn wide public attention .
while the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .
ye jingzhong is the assistant dean of the college of humanities and development at china agricultural university , and team leader of the left - behind children task force .
in the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western china , including shaanxi , ningxia , hebei , and beijing .
why did you pick the central and western parts of china , and not the south , to conduct this study ?
first of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .
they are not in a position to bring their children to the city .
when we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city .
, its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .
therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .
according to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in china now ?
this group should be the biggest in number .
um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .
nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .
many people quote a figure of 150 million .
let 's think about it this way .
if we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city . of course , families of these married people will usually have children .
moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .
so you can imagine . i believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million . it , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .
of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations . i believe the number of this group should be particularly large .
according to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .
the next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . while those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively .
according to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ? different types of custody have different impacts on their life .
no doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .
the impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .
there is no major problem in the children 's material life .
of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .
the one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .
skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .
there is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .
these three types create the biggest and the most impact .
if we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody .
first , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation . this is indisputable .
this type of family is not as good as the others . we had an example of a child in shaanxi province . um , there was a family ! this family had an older brother and a younger sister .
both parents wanted to go to the city to work . the father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too .
what happened to these two children ?
the grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !
as a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study .
after they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .
she went to visit them . when she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , " i really do n't want to stay here . i want to go home . "
later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .
um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school .
um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .
when she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings .
she then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .
the situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?
the situation that i just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common . why is it so ?
you said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .
it is true . it is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children . however , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different . they are influenced by their own habits .
for instance , there was a child who was sick .
um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in shaanxi .
they did not even know what it was made of . it was a local method . um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect .
instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect .
, they raised this point themselves . another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .
" her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .
so , all i can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . "
they also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .
after all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce . now it was down to the two grandparents .
no doubt , they could not help .
in the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .
farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school . originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education .
however , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .
during this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children .
this pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .
you have seen many kinds of left - behind children . was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ? , um , there was a child in ningxia whose name was yao zhengang .
this child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school . what impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents . he felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back .
he said that he was sick one time . his father worked in guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home .
after his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away .
after he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .
he just carried him like that without saying a word . when the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .
when yao zhengang told us what happened , he said , " my father had never bought me so many tasty foods before .
on that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . "
i thought about this at that time . after i heard this incident , i particularly understood what was in the mind of yao zhengang 's father . he might have felt especially guilty toward his child .
what he felt was that " i go out to work and leave my child home . " he said that his child had also said , " when he was at home , he always encouraged me . "
he would say , " no problem . you work hard and get a better grade next time , " when i had low grades .
if he could receive many , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes .
he does not want to go to school now .
however , in his example , i could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time .
i think that he felt very guilty toward his child . therefore , i can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative . they are forced into making such decisions .
um , there was also this child .
there was a child , a girl in xixiang county , shaanxi province .
um , when i asked , " what do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? " she did not answer .
she went home to get a small box .
there was a small finger inside the box .
this was a very terrifying incident . what was the small finger all about ?
what happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her .
they had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .
when she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .
her grandparents said , " we ca n't help . we ca n't keep an eye on her all the time . "
, before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .
he had told her not to do that before . however , i said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control . that was why she turned this way .

this is ruangang village , bocang town , yi county , hebei province .
among the 303 households in the village , one - third of the families have people who work in the city .
more than half of the children in the village are left - behind children .
most of the children 's parents are in the southern part of the country .
many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money , so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two .
life is so vast . life is an ocean wherever life exists .
it has been six years since 14 - year - old jiang beiwen was sent by his parents to live with his maternal grandfather in ruangang village .
his parents rely on selling rice in guangzhou to support their child 's education .
they live a very hard life . little beiwen has not seen them once in the past six years . oh , i see so many children here who can turn for comfort in their parents ' arms !
ah , i envy them .
so , i also , want to be able to turn to comfort in my parents ' arms .
i was at school the time i missed my mother the most . uh huh . we had a market ! oh , every day , there were parents who bought things for their oh , sons and daughters .
i also wish that my parents could buy me things . i envied them very much . that was when i missed my mother the most .
this is jiang beiwen 's favorite photo . it was taken with his father six years ago , before he sent him to live with his maternal grandfather .
he was only eight years old at that time .
the only connection that little beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .
in his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable .
how often can your mother call you ?
uh , once a week !
what do you talk about ?
i will talk about my studies and life .
my schoolwork was not quite good when i first came !
my mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .
she said that i was losing honor for not doing well at school ! then i cried and after that , my mother cried , too .
since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .
while for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .
the survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents ' workplace .
8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children .
21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month .
since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?
our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .
however , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .
what could they talk about in three minutes ?
i think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .
of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .
what did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?
what touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned .
as for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school .
whether they were good and how their schoolwork was . second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that .
uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange .
we know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange . however , the parents may not have realized this .
for instance , the child has stopped talking . he stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .
the parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately . of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?
in many cases , it was because they worried about the charge . , many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone .
however , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home . it was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .
second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call .
some children told me , " i secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home . " the children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange . do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?
um , um , we conducted a survey on this question . we were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home . how could that be possible ?
how could that be possible ?
we interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .
why would n't the children know what they did ?
first , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .
however , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .
thus , i believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job . why do they do that ?
it is because they are afraid that their children will worry .
second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind .
maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .
they , do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child 's mind .
at noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home .
jiang beiwen has to make lunch for himself . this happens to him very often .
he could look after himself since he was nine . what work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?
uh , i will do the dishes after i finish eating .
if it is sunday when i am free , i will , also do some farm work .
what kind of work ?
uh , i will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , i will help do some work .
do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?
uh huh , i do .
it was especially tasty .
now , the most i want to know is , my parents ' health .
why do you want to know about that ?
it is because i care about my parents very much .
i think about their work because i know that they work in the city because of me , so i care about them a lot .
they will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .
i believe it is also because of me , so i care about their health a lot .
because of you , why is it because of you ?
because if they did n't have me , i think they uh , would be a lot more , relaxed when they worked .
then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? or go to the city with them ?
in regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .
however , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .
however , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .
we also asked them why they did not want to go to the city . this was also very surprising to us .
they said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .
they were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .
second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city .
their parents have to send money home , among other things .
if they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents .
if we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .
as for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .
as for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?
i believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .
all parents , i can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children .
however , with the reality that they have to face , i believe that they can not solve this problem .
of course , we know what the reality is .
first , their families are rather poor to begin with . only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city . they have to make money to support the family . they will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .
nonetheless , i believe there are also many other reasons . they also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .
they have to find a place to live . all these are problems that they need to resolve . the problems they face are too many . if the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .
since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need . many parents are unable to bring their children with them . what would you tell your parents if you could see them now ? i want to tell them that i miss them very much .
judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?
it is hard to tell from the surface .
why is it so ? for these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city .
for example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .
in this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .
however , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .
they had very strange um , um , temperaments . they did not like to speak .
there was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .
um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .
he was very good at school .
however , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination .
after that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed .
um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange .
um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him .
they said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him .
um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .
however , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development .
this situation indeed exists . after all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete . i believe love is especially important . children need love from the time they are small .
we have to understand our chinese saying , " the child is father to the man . "
what it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life . only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future . this is the case . therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .
um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home . perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .
under this situation , i believe , i am not sure , um , i am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .
will they believe there is love in society or not ?
will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it . they have never completely experienced it .
thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , i think this is , something that i do not want to imagine .
despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .
according to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life .
58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .
are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ? do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ? they thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face .
they were condemned to this reality .
no doubt , i think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration . why do n't they ? i believe people are all the same .
if they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood .
they can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed .
for example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in shaanxi province .
many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings . once there was a flood .
, these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home ! this happened in the rural area . these two children were looking after the home .
their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .
their father called later to see if they were fine .
the family told him that they were fine .
he did not come back after that .
he did not come back to check if everything was fine .
i believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .
after the handover : taiwan - macau relations in the new millennium
last year , nearly one million travelers from taiwan passed through macau airport , heading for mainland china or visiting macau itself , and accounting for 80 % of passengers using the airport .
around 1,000 of macau 's civil servants have studied in taiwan , and every year some 30,000 people travel from macau to taiwan for business or work , along with more than 400 students . but against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the prc about how " macau 's ' one country two systems ' arrangement sets an example for solving the taiwan problem , " these figures , along with the taiwan - macau exchanges that they represent , have been willfully neglected by macau 's mainstream media .
macau and taiwan : so near and yet so far .
what are the connections that bind these two places , and what are the opportunities for new developments in the wake of the 1999 handover ?
on december 19 , 1999 , the eve of macau 's transfer of sovereignty , the china times in taiwan published a survey on the taiwanese public 's views about macau 's return to chinese control .
according to the survey , 31 % of people in taiwan were n't even aware that macau was about to be handed back to china , while 53 % answered that they did n't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for macau 's development .
but when asked whether the " one country two systems " formula , as used for hong kong and macau , was acceptable for taiwan , 59 % responded " no , " while 27 % said that they did n't know .
as these results clearly indicate , the people of taiwan still know little about macau , in spite of existing exchanges , and more than half of them flatly reject beijing 's " one country two systems " formula - so readily taken up in macau - as a solution to the taiwan question .
conveniently connected it takes just an hour and a half to fly from taiwan to macau . as macau university professor wong hon keong says , " you can get there and back in a day .
you catch the first flight to macau in the morning , stop at the westin for a coffee and to talk business , head to one of the outlying islands in the afternoon for a round of golf , take a stroll downtown , and return to taiwan that evening . " but in spite of the convenience for travelers , ties between the two places have been practically invisible for several decades . what path will the relationship follow now that macau has returned to china ? as you pass through the offices of the macau government 's directorate of administration you notice the relative youth of the staff , most of whom seem to be in their thirties .
rosa tam , who heads the recruitment and selection division of the directorate 's human resources department , introduces many of her colleagues with the remark that he or she " studied in taiwan too . "
tam herself graduated from the department of educational psychology at national taiwan normal university in 1985 , and joined macau 's department of education in 1987 , before eventually moving to the directorate of administration and rising to the post of division chief in just 11 years .
tam is just one of the many macau civil servants who have studied for degrees in taiwan .
the macau government 's directorate for administration says that around 200 macau civil servants have academic qualifications from taiwan , but according to taiwan 's representative office in the territory , the figure is closer to 1,000 .
this may not represent a very large share of macau 's 17,000 civil servants , but given that many of those who graduated in taiwan hold senior ranks , it adds something of a " taiwan flavor " to the government of the macau sar -lrb- special administrative region -rrb- . in contrast , taiwan alumni are noticeable by their absence from the sar government in hong kong .
at present , the most senior government official to have studied in taiwan is ou wenlong , who graduated in mechanical engineering at national taiwan university -lrb- ntu -rrb- .
ou is macau 's secretary for transportation and public works , and has been appointed by chief executive edmund ho as one of the sar government 's five administration secretaries .
amid all the hype surrounding macau 's incorporation under the " one country two systems " formula , the sensitive issue of the " taiwan connection " within the macau government is little discussed .
as the clearest example of this connection , ou wenlong is one official that many journalists from taiwan have tried to get an interview with , but their requests have all been turned down on the grounds that the secretary is " too busy . "
he did nevertheless find time to do an interview with hong kong 's phoenix tv , during which he discoursed freely on the subject of macau 's development .
sinorama applied , in line with official procedure , for a press pass to the handover ceremony , but the application was eventually rejected as " unapproved by the security department . " on the eve of the handover , the signboard of the taipei trade and tourism office in macau was quietly taken down , after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty .
office director william li was subsequently reprimanded by the mainland affairs council for his handling of the affair . none of the above was problems at the time of hong kong 's handover in 1997 , which goes to show how cautious the macau sar government is regarding taiwan . when senior macau officials are asked about having studied in taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in macau , lisbon , or mainland china .
" it 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips tan zhiqiang , hong kong and macau bureau chief for the china times , who was born and raised in macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " the question of macau 's sovereignty . "
the more senior a government official is , the more defensive he is likely to be on the subject of his studies in taiwan . " it does n't matter where you studied and where you graduated , " says chen mingying , a senior official in the macau government 's news department .
competence and professionalism are what the government requires from its personnel . another graduate of a taiwan institution declares bluntly that he only spent four years in taiwan getting his degree , and the place had virtually no effect on him at all .
nevertheless , there has been a steady stream of students from macau to taiwan ever since 1955 .
according to statistics from the overseas chinese affairs commission , around 6,000 have come in the past ten years , and professor wong hon keong of macau university 's macau research center says that 30 % of middle school graduates in the territory have sat the overseas enrolment test for college in taiwan .
around 600 candidates passed the test last year , and there are on average 1,600 - 2,000 students from macau at university in taiwan at any one time .
" semi-liberated area "
perhaps the reason for the apparent lack of attachment to taiwan among the many returned taiwan alumni can be traced to historical factors .
in 1966 , macau was convulsed by rioting in which several people were shot and killed by portuguese security forces . the enclave 's left - wing groups , which were closely allied with beijing , took advantage of the situation to get kmt organizations in macau shut down and their people expelled . ever since , macau has been regarded in certain circles in taiwan as a " semi-liberated area . "
but if macau 's pro-beijing forces are that strong , how come so many students come to taiwan to get their degrees ?
" there are historical reasons for this too , " says ou jinrong , former president of macau 's taiwan alumni association and a member both of the macau sar 's first selection committee , and its preparatory committee . prior to the 1980s , macau lacked its own colleges , and students had to go overseas for higher education .
also , colleges on the mainland did n't start enrolling overseas students until the mid-1980s , while it was difficult to gain admission to university in hong kong . under these circumstances , taiwanese universities , which actively recruited abroad , were a natural choice for many macau students .
" in terms of the return you get on your investment , taking your degree in taiwan is well worth it , " says wang yun , acting head of the sanitation and environment division of macau 's urban administration office , who graduated in civil engineering from national cheng kung university -lrb- ncku -rrb- in tainan .
taiwan 's universities have good teachers and decent facilities , says wang , and students from macau can learn much in taiwan that will benefit them in their careers . unlike the colonial administration in hong kong , the government of macau under the portuguese recognized academic credentials issued by taiwanese institutions .
it was only in the mid-1980s , once the timetable for the handover of hong kong and macau had been agreed , that the government began to localize the civil service in preparation for the transition to " macau people running macau . "
a number of graduates who had returned from taiwan to work in the private sector then shifted to government jobs , and have come to form an influential part of the administration . " little prawns grow into big lobsters if there are no fish in the sea , " smiles leong kam chun , who graduated in business administration from ntu in 1973 . compared with the many macau students who went to the mainland to study from the mid-1980s onwards , those who graduated in taiwan returned and joined the civil service earlier , and seem to have made faster progress in their careers .
" there 's no denying that taiwan universities have given us a good education , " smiles leong hong sai , secretary of macau 's taiwan universities alumni association .
in addition to the government officials who studied in taiwan , many returned graduates have become influential in macau through their success in the private sector .
leong kam chun , for instance , one of the territory 's first group of professional accountants , has also served on the legislative council and is a member of the macau sar selection committee .
leong man io , current president of the taiwan universities alumni association , who graduated in civil engineering from ncku , is one of macau 's most prominent civil engineers .
he has supervised several major projects such as landscaping macau 's maritime museum and setting up venues for the handover events . unlike neighboring hong kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . everything seemed smooth and orderly .
but the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming sar administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order . the three " localizations " - of civil administration , the law , and official language - have become a focus of public discussion . concern has been expressed that responsibility has been passed to local administrators too late , and that they are too young and inexperienced - statistics from the department of civil service reveal that 61 % of government officials are 40 or under - to deal effectively with problems facing the newly established sar .
leong kam chun says : " hong kong began nurturing local administrative talent in the mid-1970s , whereas macau only started doing so ten years later , in the mid-1980s .
" several problems have already begun to emerge , such as the question of " legal localization . "
gary mei , executive director of the sino - latino foundation of macau , points out that during their four centuries in macau the portuguese never attempted to build up the portuguese language ability of the local people .
few chinese have ever mastered portuguese , and there are not many people who understand both western law and the chinese language . this presents enormous difficulties for the localization into chinese of macau 's mass of colonial era laws .
due to the chronic dearth of qualified personnel among macau 's judiciary , much of the work of legal localization depends on experts from the mainland . but according to gary mei , " the socialist law that they are used to on the mainland is out of synch with the capitalist - type law of macau , in terms both of attitude and spirit . " but legal professionals who have studied in taiwan , where legal concepts are closer to those that hold in macau , can play an important role in this localization process .
communication bridge
from taiwan 's perspective , how can these taiwan alumni benefit the taiwan - macau relationship ?
as one of the alumni explains , this is an issue that does n't need to be addressed too directly : with a network of personal connections , the right kind of communication follows naturally .
ou jinrong frankly notes that yue meizhen , former vice-director of the taiwan affairs section of the hong kong branch of xinhua agency , once encouraged the alumni to " do more to be a bridge between the two sides . "
and in april , taiwan 's mainland affairs council invited members of the taiwan universities alumni association on a visit back to taiwan , " to hear our views on taiwan - macau relations , " says leong hong sai .
wong hon keong , deputy director of the macau research center at macau university , says that the presence of these taiwan alumni in macau " makes it easier for the taiwanese to get things done , " and he feels that this is an asset for taiwan in terms of developing relations with macau .
william li , director of the taipei economic and cultural center in macau , also testifies to the benefits that the alumni bring for taiwan : " if they 're not too high up in the government , we generally have no problem contacting them by phone , providing information , and getting together for things like social events . "
but tan zhiqiang , himself a returned alumni , points out while it 's fine having dinner together , if it ever came to it , none of the alumni would want to actively " align " themselves with taiwan , given the pro-beijing political climate in macau .
" which is closer , taiwan or the mainland ? " asks tan .
friendly factions
on the other hand , political divisions are not as sharply defined in macau as they are in hong kong , and people are not so uptight about who they come into contact with . after all , macau covers an area of just 23 sq. km -lrb- roughly equivalent to the nankang district of taipei -rrb- and has a population of 430,000 . as leong kam chun says , macau " still has the feel of a rural society . "
you bump into the same people all the time in macau , and if you 're too strict about factions , you only make things difficult for yourself .
" unlike hong kong people , macau people do n't like to talk politics , " says leong . " they 're more interested in the economy . "
leong describes himself as belonging to the pragmatic " making - a - living " faction . although pro-beijing elements prevail in macau , the former portuguese administration did n't seem too bothered about prc pressure when it came to the issue of ties with taiwan , perhaps because their only concern was for people 's livelihood .
visa - free entry to macau for taiwanese is a case in point . explains wong hon keong : " macau offers visa - free access to residents of over 40 countries with which it has consular relations , but taiwan is the only place for which it provides visa - free access without there being diplomatic ties . "
moreover , taiwanese officials have always had an easier time going in and out of macau , compared with the fuss involved in getting to hong kong .
for example , p.k. chiang , chairman of the council for economic planning and development , visited macau shortly before the handover , and even figures such as mainland democracy activist wu'er kaixi have been admitted to macau on their way to the mainland - though the mainland authorities of course refused to allow wu'er to cross into the prc .
taiwanese businesspeople in macau form another group that is usually thought of as only concerned about " making a living . " chen chung - yung , chairman of the taiwan general chamber of commerce is a typical example .
chen arrived in macau ten years ago , and ran air - tours by light aircraft until the enclave 's international airport opened , after which he moved into the liquor trade .
when he travels to the mainland he takes his macau resident 's permit , but when he comes back to taiwan he uses his roc passport .
as part of his efforts to attract more taiwanese investors to do business in macau , he helped introduce president group ceo kao chin - yen to the territory , and in order to build better ties with the mainland chinese , he helped the xinhua news agency in macau to install satellite tv .
but when he found that his elementary - school - age grandson was speaking cantonese all day he quickly sent him back to school in taiwan , fearing that the boy was losing his mother tongue . a consensus among the taiwanese living and working in macau is that " you ca n't use ideology to decide what 's right and wrong . "
another point they agree on is that not enough was done in the past to develop ties between taiwan and macau , but that with macau 's change of status , and the corresponding change in atmosphere , things should be different from now on .
chen chung - yung points out that rents in macau are about 25 % less than rents in hong kong , while macau 's connections with the european union means that it enjoys tax concessions and generous trade quotas .
" taiwanese businesspeople never notice these benefits . all they see is gang violence and assume that law and order has broken down , " says chen . his own account of the situation is that the gangs are fighting it out over casino profits , but that this does n't affect the lives of ordinary people .
chen encourages people not to worry , and hopes that they wo n't hesitate to invest in macau .
economic dwarf , cultural giant but there are also those who think chen chung - yung 's attitude is over-optimistic .
chen ming - chih , a taiwanese businessman based in dongguan , points out that wages in macau are not particularly low and there 's very little spare land , no deepwater harbor and no natural resources , which explains why firms remain more interested in investing on the mainland than in macau . wong hon keong gives a telling analysis : " what macau can offer is a service base , with visa - free access , convenience of travel , and open channels of information .
with taiwan for r&d and zhuhai as the manufacturing base , macau can provide a window to foreign trade , through which companies can increase their exports to the eu . "
wong 's comments pinpoint the intermediary role that macau plays between taiwan and the mainland . as leong kam chun notes : " because macau is so small and sits rights next to mainland china , its economy is always vulnerable to external factors . " as soon as the asian financial crisis hit hong kong , the macau economy was similarly affected , and unemployment reached 7 % .
moreover , the contribution made by taiwanese businesses to macau is even less than the spillover from hong kong firms investing in neighboring zhuhai .
apart from economics , what other forms of possible interaction can taiwan and macau share ?
macau has been a contact point between east and west ever since portuguese ships first arrived in the 16th century .
as gary mei points out , the enclave was opened to the outside world more than 300 years before hong kong . during much of the ming and qing dynasties , when maritime trade was officially banned , macau was the shipping hub for the " silk road of the sea , " which extended as far as south asia , africa and europe in one direction , and japan , southeast asia and south america in the other .
says mei : " this is where the jesuits established the first western - type university in the far east , while chinese scholars such as hong xiuquan , lin zexu , liang qichao , kang youwei and cheng guanying spent time here absorbing western learning . "
macau emerged unscathed from wwii , and many of its original portuguese - language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between east and west . in recent years , these archives have attracted particular attention from taiwan scholars , notes mei , driven by interest in the history of east - west exchanges and the influence of maritime culture on their island
furthermore , macau also serves as an academic and cultural key to the world of the romance languages .
as mei explains , there are plenty of old portuguese texts preserved in macau , and the university has a sizeable contingent of portuguese - speaking professors . most of the territory 's 10,000 - plus macanese -lrb- locally born portuguese -rrb- have elected to remain after the handover , and there are several cultural groups dedicated to the work of translating portuguese literature and preserving portuguese culture . " taiwanese who wish to study portuguese do n't have to go to europe , " says mei . " it 's enough to come to macau . "
though it occupies a tiny spit of land , the former portuguese colony is home to 12 museums of art and history , more than hong kong .
" as economic entities go , macau is tiny , " says mei , " but as a store of culture it 's huge .
so do n't look down on the place . " matsu bridges the gap
ngan in leng , president of macau 's fujian association , explains that the traditional three - way ties between macau , taiwan and the southern fujian region remain to this day , and taiwanese visitors to macau can still see traces of fujianese culture at locations such as lin fong temple and the area around barrier gate .
and indeed it was fujianese fishermen who several centuries ago built the first matsu temple here - the a - ma - gau from which macau takes its name . ung choi kun , deputy chairman of macau 's fujian general chamber of commerce , says that 100,000 mainlanders have moved to macau in the past two decades , almost all of them from fujian province . at present , around 30,000 people from macau travel to taiwan every year for work , many of them ethnic fujianese taking advantage of family connections to the island .
" when you talk about matsu and about hometown bonds , it 's not hard finding topics that link taiwan and macau , " remarks ngan in leng . " we have many points in common in the field of academia too , such as sun yat - sen and the colonial experience , " adds wu zhiliang , director of the macau foundation .
in the realm of politics , suggests wong hon keong , macau can also serve as a " catalyst and lubricant for relations across the taiwan strait . "
the international airport , where flights between taiwan and the mainland make a stopover , allows for " one - plane " travel between the two sides . also , the continued provision after the handover of visa - free entry for taiwanese , along with the relative ease with which taiwan officials can visit the sar , testifies to macau 's flexibility in these matters .
" macau will help to boost cross-strait relations , " says wong hon keong .
but as tan zhiqiang points out , nearly a quarter of the residents of macau have arrived from the mainland during the past ten years .
unlike the british in hong kong , the portuguese colonial administration always tried to minimize conflict with beijing , promoting compromise and dialogue . as a result there was little " anti-china " sentiment among the people of macau at the time of the handover , in contrast to the pro-democracy mood that swept hong kong in 1997 .
" when taiwanese are confronted with macau 's ' pro-beijing ' slant , they should try and be more understanding . " says tan .
breaking down fences
in fact , the people of macau are n't necessarily as ecstatic about the handover as they are made out to be , and after more than 400 years of rule the portuguese have left behind more than just european - style buildings , portuguese food , and churches . macau university set up a " handover workshop " a few years ago , and it has proved highly popular .
also , a number of books have been brought out by the government and by private publishers , exploring the enclave 's history and identity .
indeed , " identity " is precisely what the people of macau have been looking for . the presence of mainland china is what bonds taiwan and macau , yet it is also what keeps them apart .
the spectacular handover ceremony , which took place in the global spotlight , is already over and done with .
strolling through downtown macau one notices prominent signs advertising popular taiwanese snack - stops , like dingtaifeng dumpling restaurant and quickly iced drinks . business seems to be thriving at margaret 's egg - tart bakery , whose brand name is known throughout the region and probably defines " macau " for many in taiwan .
for businesspeople , there seems to be little evidence of obstacles in the way of better taiwan - macau relations .
the excitement surrounding the handover has died down , and life in macau goes on much as before . the artificial boundaries and obstacles that people set up between each other must ultimately be removed by people themselves .
my heart is in macau :
" local portuguese " carlos marreiros -lrb- jackie chen / tr. by brent heinrich -rrb- around the time of the macau handover , questions that were hot in the western media were , what is " macaense " ?
and what is native macau culture ?
this is carlos marreiros 's story . the story began during the era of great sailing ships . four hundred years ago , a portuguese trading vessel dropped anchor off the island of macau , intent on doing business with imperial china . that one brief rest stop destined macau to become a cultural montage that includes chinese , indian , malay , portuguese and other european influences .
today , macaense -lrb- or macanese -rrb- , the free mix of the various ethnic currents of macau has become the most vibrant element of its culture . " without it , macau would n't exist , " says carlos marreiros , who once served as director of the macau government 's bureau of culture , and now works as an architect , painter , author and poet .
ethnic melting pot marreiros is a typical macanese .
his grandfather was portuguese , his grandmother chinese . his mother has a mix of spanish and malay blood . in macau , he 's what is known as a " local portuguese . " marreiros was born in macau , but " most of my education took place in europe , " he says .
he attended university in lisbon , received his master 's degree in germany , and went on to study landscaping in sweden . his principal impressions of china come from his family and his contacts with chinese people .
when he was young , marreiros worked in a macau post office . one of his coworkers was a chinese of the older generation , who often chatted with him about tang - dynasty poetry , and chinese proverbs and myths .
for a while marreiros taught chinese people how to speak portuguese . " i learned quite a lot about the way many chinese people think , " he says .
carlos marreiros speaks fluent portuguese , cantonese , english and german .
he has done research on traditional chinese poetry , and has included some in his portuguese - language writings . he personally manifests a blend of chinese and western influences .
marreiros emphasizes that in addition to chinese and portuguese influences , macau also has its own unique blend of culture - macaense , which is exhibited in " local portuguese " of mixed ancestry such as himself .
" the world 's first mixed-race culture appeared in macau , " he says . now with the convenience of travel and transportation , the intermingling of black , white and yellow peoples is nothing new , but 400 years ago , the people of macau intertwined cultures from as far afield as india , southeast asia and japan . their influences can be seen everywhere in the cuisine , architecture and literature of macau .
intellectual assets
in the enclave 's restaurants , such classic macanese dishes as curry and portuguese chicken are served up with a wide variety of seasonings , blending the sweet flavors of cantonese dishes with the rich , tangy taste of old-style indian fare .
one example is macanese baoguo , a combination of chinese sausage , cabbage and tripe - not precisely portuguese , nor cantonese either .
the exteriors of traditional macau buildings are noticeably southern european in style . but marreiros , an architect , points out that while the outsides of many houses are european , the arrangement of rooms and furniture inside is often done in a chinese manner .
" the important space is given to the father and the eldest son . the remaining side rooms are for the ladies of the house and others - quite different from portuguese architecture , " he says . and the details of ornamentation , such as engravings , glasswork and wood carvings , are actually rendered in qing - dynasty fashion .
the most representative example is macau 's oldest church , sao paolo -lrb- the ruins of st. paul 's -rrb- . its surviving stone facade is embellished with stone carvings not only of such catholic images as angels and the virgin mary , but also of dragon - and - phoenix motifs and fishing boats , as well as catholic phrases written in chinese characters . marreiros believes that the hybrid culture of macau is its greatest asset .
" macau is so small . it has no land for industry or agriculture . all it has to rely on is intellect , " he says . three hundred years ago , missionaries in macau built the first university in the far east , the jesuit college of st. paul 's .
since the 1980s , macau has established six institutes of higher learning .
" macau 's population is young , and the average educational level is quite high , " he notes .
four hundred years of cultural intercourse between occident and orient has left behind enormous assets in macau , and the enclave 's people have the ability to form a bridge of exchange between east and west .
now that macau 's sovereignty has switched hands , marreiros has chosen not to return to his motherland of portugal , but to remain behind . " macau is my home . my heart is in macau , " he says . marreiros is a person of macau , part portuguese and part chinese . a diversity of cultures will only enrich a person , not create a crisis of identity .
for taiwanese people , who have questions about their own identity and often ask themselves who they are , what thoughts does carlos marreiros 's story bring to mind ? p. 27 -lrb- facing page -rrb- carlos marreiros is a good representative of macaemse culture . his wife , as well , is a " local portuguese " of mixed ancestry . -lrb- courtesy of carlos marreiros -rrb-
a second spring for textiles in taiwan ? -lrb- laura li / photos by pu hua - chih / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
early in december the china textile in - stitute , located at tucheng in taipei county , celebrated its 40th anniversary with a dynamic multimedia show .
the cti 's 40 - year history has borne witness to the rise and decline of taiwan 's textile industry . forty years ago , taiwan was just crossing the threshold of industrialization .
the textile industry was the darling of the nation , just like the electronics industry today .
although it has lost its former kudos , the textile industry is still an indispensable part of taiwan 's industrial landscape .
for the last decade , the cti has been working hand in hand with the industry , quietly sowing the seeds of research and development in many places . can those seeds germinate to create a second spring for taiwan 's textile industry ?
as the latest bout of winter weather hits taiwan , do you want to go up mt. hehuan to see the snow ?
you could put on a jacket containing highly insulating melt - spun ceramic fibers .
when the wind sends a fine driving rain slanting across the water , are you still unwilling to forgo the pleasure of sea angling ?
why not wear some micropore breathable rainwear , with an outer layer which is completely waterproof , but an inner layer which is dry and comfortable on the skin ?
tencel , made from wood cellulose , has given the lie to the notion that man - made fibers never degrade , and is set to become one of the most important fibers of the coming environmental century ; and the shrimp and crab shells which were once tossed away are now being processed to extract chitin , which when used to treat clothing can inhibit bacteria and mold and prevent unwanted odors , and which can also be used as a dressing for burns which both reduces inflammation and encourages new tissue growth . . . .
what sunset industry ?
ceramic fibers , stainless steel , shrimp shells - at first glance there seems to be no connection with spinning and weaving . but in fact these are among the latest products and trends quietly taking shape in the textile industry . with the rise of new industries such as electronics , aerospace and biotechnology , the areas of application for textile products have expanded ever wider , from being simply coverings for the human body to finding their way up into space and down into the earth .
" there are only sunset products , not sunset industries . " these words from competitiveness guru michael porter hit the nail on the head when it comes to taiwan 's textile industry 's current efforts to transform itself into a high - tech , capital - and information - intensive sector .
" twenty years ago , the polyester uniforms worn by schoolchildren in taiwan turned dreadfully stiff when you tried to wash them ; cotton clothes shrank ; nylon made your skin red and itchy ; stockings would ladder if you so much as looked at them ; and decent clothes had to be expensively dry cleaned , " recalls cti president yao hsing - chuan . if clothes in taiwan today are getting ever lighter , softer , warmer , more wrinkle - free and easier to keep clean , and if their colors are bright , fresh and stain - resistant , this is not thanks to the magic wand wielded by cinderella 's fairy godmother , but is the result of the unceasing efforts towards research , development and upgrading put in by the textile industry over the years . " upgrading " has been a word on the lips of everyone in the textile industry in recent years . but the adverse environment in which the industry has had to operate has made the pace of that upgrading halting and hesitant .
" in the early 1980s , making ready - to - wear garments for export was pretty much a sure - fire money - spinner .
everything sold like hot cakes , just like electronics today , " says yao hsing - chuan .
but around 1987 , under strong us pressure , the nt dollar appreciated , and exporters lost their competitive price advantage .
next , there was a series of rises in land and labor costs . garment making is labor - intensive , and the combination of internal and external pressures led to wholesale factory closures .
many firms moved production to mainland china or southeast asia , and taiwan 's remaining domestic textile industry was dramatically reshuffled . with the departure of the ready - to - wear industry , taiwan lost its " garment kingdom " status . but looking from another perspective , the taiwanese manufacturers who spread all over southeast asia , mainland china and latin america were still very much a force to be reckoned with , and in their new locations they continued to source raw materials and semi-finished goods from taiwan .
with their support , the upstream portions of the industry - fiber making , yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing , finishing and garment design - were able to stay in taiwan and prosper .
in september 1998 , while the industry was still reeling from the effects of the asian financial crisis , construction began of the long - planned specialist industrial parks in yunlin and changhua counties .
these were the peak of the large investments made in taiwan 's textile industry over recent years . but overcapacity and shrinking demand caused by the crisis had hit the industry hard . by mid-1999 things were looking up again , but then massive power failures in the wake of the 21 september earthquake wiped out nearly nt$ 10 billion worth of textile orders .
taiwan 's biggest currency earner
nevertheless , thanks to its solid foundations built up over 40 years , the textile industry is still a pillar of taiwan 's economy .
in 1999 , taiwan 's textile exports are expected to be worth us$ 14.5 billion or 12 % of the island 's total exports , behind only electronics -lrb- 17.6 % -rrb- and it / telecom products -lrb- 12.3 % -rrb- .
moreover , after deducting the cost of imported raw materials etc. , the textile industry is taiwan 's biggest foreign currency earner , bringing in over us$ 10 billion each year .
for instance , polyester is the most widely used man - made fiber , and little taiwan produces no less than 17 % of the total worldwide supply , making it the largest supplier .
the island 's total production of man - made fibers ranks third globally , behind the usa and mainland china .
at present , the largest category among taiwan 's textile exports is finished cloth , which accounts for more than 60 % of taiwan 's textile exports by value . " the textile industry has deep roots in taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment .
thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . "
cti acting vice-president wu chung - fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something taiwan should not lightly give up .
we ca n't give it up , but neither can we rest on our laurels . with southeast asia and mainland china catching up fast , taiwan 's textile industry will only have a future if it can quickly transform itself and develop towards high - tech products .
the cti , which a decade ago began a timely change in its role to one of a specialist r&d center working in partnership with firms , has become the leading r&d center for taiwan 's several thousand textile industry companies . the development of new " nylon 66 " fibers is a case in point .
grace kuo , a vice-president at ta ching hwa enterprise co . -lrb- tch -rrb- , as yet the only company in taiwan to manufacture nylon 66 filament , recounts that ten years ago her husband and a group of friends who had worked many years at formosa chemicals and fiber corporation wanted to set up in business for themselves .
at that time , a huge amount of nylon 66 fiber - 600 tonnes per month - was used by the local textile industry in the manufacture of specialty apparel such as women 's tights , swimwear and underwear . but taiwan had no manufacturing capability in the fiber , and relied entirely on imports . this aroused their interest in entering the field .
david and goliath
grace kuo comments that nylon 66 was a new fiber with good elasticity , high strength and a soft , bulky feel , along with good resistance to ultraviolet light . adding just 15 to 20 % of nylon 66 to a fabric transforms it , making it thoroughly suited to modern - day demands for " healthy , comfortable " clothing .
the big international manufacturers had realized this and adopted an oligarchic strategy : as well as making it difficult for others to obtain the raw materials , they were very careful not to reveal any of their manufacturing know - how .
but thanks to the expertise the tch team had built up over many years in the textile fibers field , within the first year after the company was set up they succeeded in drawing filaments from nylon 66 granules .
" as soon as we did that , dupont cut their prices , hoping to squeeze us right out of the market , " says grace kuo with a smile . but after going head - to - head with tch for several years , dupont realized how resilient the company was , and since then the two firms have begun to cooperate .
currently , tch is the world 's fifth - largest manufacturer of nylon 66 filament , supplying 8 % of the global market . it stands as another example of a taiwanese company successfully taking on the big boys in international markets .
the original use of nylon 66 was in tights and swimwear , but these are far from being the only applications for such a superior new fiber .
but because the filaments are so thin -lrb- only half the thickness of a human hair -rrb- , they can easily break at the yarn spinning stage , and at the dyeing stage the yarn absorbs only the smallest dye molecules . hence firms around the world are still feeling their way forward on how to use this fiber .
for this reason , tch approached the cti to conduct a series of cooperative development projects . to date they have successfully developed various new yarns blended from nylon 66 and other fibers such as acrylic or polyester , and have staged numerous seminars and visited many firms to teach users how to weave and dye the new fabrics and how to design for them .
why go to such lengths to popularize new fibers ?
grace kuo says the textile industry today needs to take a lead from the electronics industry , and constantly strive for innovation : " what consumer today does n't already have a wardrobe full of clothes ? if you want to persuade her to spend , you have to keep putting out products which look novel at the first glance and feel great at the first touch . only then can you create demand and stimulate consumption , " she avers .
behind the quest for innovation and change , there needs to be a great deal of r&d work , along with a keen nose for the market . but 95 % of taiwan 's textile firms are small or medium - sized enterprises .
they do not have the facilities or staff to carry on r&d , and they lack the perspective to take a broad view of worldwide trends . hence in the upgrading process , organizations like the cti will play an increasingly important role . flexibility v. perfectionism
however , g - fun industrial corporation general manager tsai chiu - hsiung , who worked at the cti for many years before setting up in business for himself in late 1998 , has had a different experience . while at the cti , tsai headed a project to develop the technology for making breathable waterproof fabrics . at that time , he says , few manufacturers in taiwan were both interested in the technology and competent to apply it .
later , when his team had developed the process , many firms expressed an interest . but once they had acquired the technology , many lost money or even went out of business - the results were far from ideal . " at that time i felt very frustrated .
it was clearly a good process , but after buying the technology for a nominal sum , many companies did n't value it , " says tsai chiu - hsiung . on the one hand , the market for breathable waterproof fabrics was not yet mature , and too many companies entering all at once knocked the bottom out of the market ; on the other , manufacturers in taiwan still lack the concept of dedicating production equipment to one product . for fear of putting all their eggs in one basket , many firms are in the habit of producing whatever they can get orders for : today it may be waterproof fabric , tomorrow cloth for tarpaulins , and next month purses .
their product mix is very varied , with frequent switching . this makes quality control difficult , so that when firms are faced with a technically demanding product , defects may easily arise .
worse , they are often unable even to identify the cause . " ' flexibility ' helps smes survive in difficult times , but it is not conducive to the perfectionist attitudes needed when upgrading . " tsai chiu - hsiung , who urges companies to " know when to give things up , " has now been in business for himself for a year , and his is the only firm in taiwan which specializes in applying breathable waterproof coatings to fabrics .
with more orders than he can handle , he is now preparing to build a new factory at touliu in yunlin county . g - fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water - soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time . g - fun is also co-operating with the cti to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .
at present , most of the company 's orders come from europe and the usa , and are made into upmarket leisurewear such as climbing or golf apparel which sells for as much as nt$ 8,000 per garment .
like tch , g - fun also hopes its products can help taiwan 's textile industry upgrade .
" the 21st century will be an age of leisure , and taiwanese sport and leisurewear fabrics have long held first place worldwide .
if they can all be given better breathability and water resistance , this will greatly increase their added value , " says tsai chiu - hsiung .
fabrics treated by g - fun are currently a third cheaper than the same grades of fabric from japan , and tsai hopes he can attract taiwanese firms to make greater use of them .
a short - term view another type of new fabric which is in great demand is wicking fabric , based on fibers with a special cross-section . the leading volume producer of wicking fibers in taiwan is chung shing textile company .
its president , william shang , explains that conventional fibers have a round cross-section , but by changing the fibers ' physical properties it is possible to produce them with various cross-sectional profiles such as x or y shapes , which create capillaries along the fibers .
these not only quickly wick sweat away from the skin , but also regulate body temperature and allow garments to dry quickly after washing .
however , the fibers ' special properties can easily be destroyed in the various processes they go through such as yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing and finishing , so that making finished garments requires a high degree of technical sophistication .
chung shing has launched a fabric named coolplus to compete with dupont 's equivalent product , coolmax .
" developing new fibers is the most important element in upgrading the textile industry , " says shang .
however , he acknowledges that although many new products are being developed in taiwan , on closer inspection they are all copies of products first developed elsewhere , and so fall some way short of real innovation .
but whereas it used to take taiwanese companies several years of trial and error to figure out how to make such products , the gap between them and their european and american competitors is growing ever smaller . when new products appear overseas it now only takes taiwan two to three years to bring out an equivalent .
william shang observes that when most taiwanese firms see something new at an overseas exhibition they will bring back a sample , inspect it under a high - powered microscope to determine the weaving method and have it chemically analyzed to find out the composition of the fibers and finishing chemicals . with taiwan 's long years of manufacturing experience , it is then not difficult to reproduce the product with 70 - 80 % accuracy . however , shang does not see this as a viable long - term strategy .
" the best strategy for the long - term is still to put more effort into basic scientific research , " he says . for example , he read in time magazine that because spiders produce the best natural fibers in the world , being both lustrous and resilient , us scientists transferred spider genes into silkworms to produce " super silkworms . "
the technique succeeded , but because the americans were not very interested in producing clothing textiles , they did not commercialize it .
when it comes to this kind of combination of lateral thinking and advanced technology , taiwan still has some way to go .
shang , currently chairman of the cti 's technology committee , is well aware of where the obstacle to r&d lies : " innovative ideas take time to mature , and you have to accept a high degree of uncertainty . but our environment does not allow this . "
he notes that industries in taiwan always pursue short - term profits , so there is never much interest in technologies which are too forward - looking and can not immediately produce saleable products .
as one of 18 industrial institutes under the ministry of economic affairs , the cti has some state funding . but with ever greater budgetary constraints and pressure to cover its own costs , development projects mostly concentrate on firms ' current needs , and stress the sales and profit they generate . under such circumstances , epoch - making innovations are unlikely to emerge .
standardizing colors
because innovation is so hard to achieve , the highly innovative sinocolor book color reference system , which was launched at the cti 's 40th anniversary celebration , has been greeted with great admiration by many .
the system 's inventor , hsu yun - peng , only had a junior high school education , but had researched color matching for 18 years in a dyeing factory .
discovering that imported color matching software was of little practical use , hsu , who did n't know a word of english , taught himself to program and wrote an improved version of the software . writing color matching software earned hsu yun - peng a lot of money , but this was not his main purpose .
his real aim was to produce a color reference system that was genuinely easy to use , to overcome the lack of color standardization which had long plagued the dyeing industry . to pursue this goal he quit his job , moved to the suburbs of kuishan in taoyuan county , and began to spend 18 hours a day studying the problem .
quite apart from the difficulties of keeping his family fed , he often was n't even sure how old his three children were and what year of school they were in . finally he used a three - dimensional model to create a regularly graded , finely differentiated color reference system covering 20,000 colors , each with clear " color coordinates . " these features are unmatched by any of the systems currently in common use worldwide , which only define up to 3,000 colors .
the textile industry 's efforts to upgrade are gradually showing some results , but looking at the situation overall , cti president yao hsing - chuan is still somewhat worried .
he comments that the majority of companies still have the traditional mindset of pursuing low - cost , high - volume production .
taiwan is the world 's third biggest producer of man - made fibers , but it only produces a small range of mass - market fibers for apparel fabrics , to the almost total neglect of the hundred or so other high - added - value , special fibers on the market such as high - strength fibers for bullet - proof fabrics , elastic fibers or superalloy aerospace fibers .
again , when it comes taiwan 's biggest export item , finished fabrics , these too are largely limited to apparel fabrics , with few companies getting involved in other areas despite their potential .
for instance , taiwan has been struck by many landslides in recent years , and requires large quantities of geotextiles - heavy - grade textiles laid under or around civil engineering structures to prevent erosion by groundwater movement .
the currently planned high - speed rail system alone is expected to require several million yards of geotextiles . but taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .
bullet - proof fabrics ?
geotextiles ?
are these part of the textile industry ?
indeed they are .
yao hsing - chuan says that textile industry products have three main fields of application : apparel , furnishings and industrial .
at present , over 95 % by value of roc textile industry output is accounted for by apparel products with low added value .
by contrast , in the usa textiles for clothing and industrial applications are produced in equal quantities , and industrial textiles include a wide variety of different products , many of which are technically demanding and command profit margins with which most apparel products can not compare . hence the cti has already made it one of its major goals to encourage firms to shift their orientation towards industrial textiles . the development of stainless - steel fibers is one success story in this area .
from false teeth to space suits dotted among the paddy fields of taichung county 's houli rural township are many metal - clad buildings which house a variety of factories producing such products as plastics , furniture and electronic components . among them is king 's metal fiber technologies company , the only firm in taiwan which draws fibers from stainless steel .
king 's president rocky chang is known to all as dr. chang , and is indeed still a practicing dentist .
a decade or so ago , while he was studying in australia , he developed an interest in metallurgy , and hoped to develop the use of metals in tooth implants . later he learned that stainless steels have an enormously wide range of applications in the textiles , industrial and military fields . but he could not find a partner to work with in australia , so he returned to taiwan and began collaborating with the cti .
today , not only is king 's on a par with the large overseas manufacturers in terms of filament drawing technology , but to assist local downstream manufacturers in using its products , it has also set up metal fiber yarn spinning and fabric weaving plants , and is making efforts in the area of nonwoven fabrics .
stroking the silver - gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high - grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but - thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments - they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .
for instance , at a recent international furniture show in taipei , king 's exhibited sound insulating panels containing metal fibers , which hi - fi buffs can install to produce an excellent sound studio effect .
cellphone cases of metal fabric can shield users from the electromagnetic radiation the phones produce ; and in the clean rooms of silicon wafer fabs , where dust particles attracted by static electricity on clothing are the biggest bugbear , there is a host of applications for anti-static fabrics , from workers ' clothing and footwear to trolleys , conveyor belts and wall coverings .
rocky chang says that before king 's started producing metal fibers , the market was divided up between a few foreign companies which charged high prices and produced only small quantities of products . furthermore , when taiwanese users had difficulties with production they did not know who to turn to for help . looking into the future , chang hopes that as a key material , stainless steel fiber can have a " locomotive " effect , encouraging various industries in taiwan to develop a range of different products . time to get weaving developing industrial textiles requires an understanding of different industries ' needs , and also requires new channels of distribution .
for instance , cellphone cases have to be sold through electronic goods shops , while car airbags have to be sold into automotive distribution channels . for entrepreneurs who have previously only sold into the clothing trade , this is a challenge . how to promote " cross-industry cooperation , " and get people in the textile industry to look beyond their own industry 's boundaries and become effective partners for the electronics , construction , medical supplies and other industries is the next task for the cti to tackle . as cti president yao hsing - chuan observes , what has enabled taiwan 's textile industry to survive through the ups and downs of its history is the highly motivated attitude of its entrepreneurs . it is this ambition which is the best guarantee of the industry creating a second spring . p. 30 an unusual fashion show at the china textile institute 's 40th anniversary celebration : the focus is not on showing fashionable new styles , but on introducing the latest fruits of textile product development in the roc . the stainless steel fibers in the fabrics worn by these models have potential applications not only in avant - garde fashions , but also in industrial conveyor belts and even space suits . p. 32 eight years ago , this was just a textile testing center with a handful of single - storey buildings and a staff of less than 20 .
but president yao hsing - chuan -lrb- left -rrb- , has single - handedly transformed it into today 's china textiles institute , with a staff of nearly 300 . with him is ho yu - lan , formerly director of the taiwan textile federation and now consultant to the cti . p. 34 the cti has an artificial climate chamber which can simulate all kinds of weather conditions such as frost and rain . our picture shows members of an roc mountaineering team testing the warmth and anti-condensation qualities of their clothing before setting out to tackle mt. everest . -lrb- courtesy of cti -rrb- p. 35 guess what these lads are doing ? they are playing a " computer handle test " game : after carefully feeling a numbered cloth sample they score it for handle -lrb- crispness , drape , pliability , etc . -rrb- and then compare their scores with those given by the computer .
many are surprised to find how different the results are ! p. 36 this high - grade fabric is completely waterproof , yet breathes to allow sweat to evaporate . it can be made into military or police rainwear and horse blankets , and is also in great demand in advanced countries for leisure wear . the picture at left shows high - value leisure apparel ; above , the fabric coating process .
p. 37 various kinds of protective fabrics find a wide range of applications in industry . the picture above shows articles made by the " fully fashioned " knitting method , which vastly increases their strength and resilience , making them suitable for crash helmet liners , protective lagging for water pipes , climbing ropes and more .
at right , cut - resistant gloves containing stainless steel fibers . they cost much less than imported products , but are just as effective . p. 37 the development of new fibers with various properties or special feel can help the industry upgrade .
at left we see soft , flexible yarns spun from high - grade stainless steel ; below , chitin , which can be drawn into thread or ground into powder to make health food .
p. 38 hsu yun - peng built on his solid practical grounding to not only develop color matching software which is widely used in taiwan , but also compile the sinocolor book color reference system covering 20,000 colors . its recent launch was a big event for taiwan 's textile industry .

james soong gets a message : show us the money ! -lrb- eric lin / tr. by phil newell -rrb- in december there was an unexpected shock in the presidential election race .
the shock did not come from the announcement on the 10th by democratic progressive party candidate chen shui - bian that his running mate would be annette lu -lrb- this was expected -rrb- , but rather from revelations about mystery funds which embroiled independent candidate james soong .
soong , who had been far ahead in public opinion polls , has suffered a severe blow from the so - called " chung hsing case , " and his support has dropped markedly , so that now chen and kuomintang candidate lien chan are running neck - and - neck with him .
indeed , the aftershocks of the case have not subsided .
on december 22 , minister of finance paul chiu , responding to interpellations in the legislative yuan , officially announced some findings of the investigation into major securities trading by soong chen - yuan , the son of james soong .
most important were revelations about accounts held in the names of soong family members . legislator yang chi - hsiung had uncovered two funds , valued at nt$ 140 million and $ 470 million , under the names of soong chen - yuan and james soong 's sister - in - law chen pi - yun . in addition , said minister chiu , there were other accounts , the largest of which reached as high as nt$ 300 million in value .
the taipei district prosecutor 's office then opened its own investigation . it collected evidence from the ministry of finance , the bank of taiwan , chung hsing bills finance , and other institutions . after tracing the flow of money , it then called in chen pi - yun and soong chen - yuan for questioning .
faced with outside scepticism , james soong then asked new party legislator hsieh chi - ta to form an audit team and investigate .
on december 28 , hsieh held a press conference to relate the results of the audit , in which he explained when the accounts were opened , how they were used , and what the flow of the money was .
at the press conference , chen pi - yun stated that there was nearly nt$ 1 billion from several sources , including more than nt$ 400 million left over from funds collected for soong 's campaign for provincial governor -lrb- which , according to the law , soong could retain -rrb- , nt$ 300 million provided by the provincial water conservancy authorities for a fund to train water conservancy specialists , more than nt$ 140 million in funds provided by the kmt for " party operations , " more than nt$ 100 million for the purpose of looking after the descendants of the late president chiang ching - kuo , and more than nt$ 14 million in family savings .
the funds were used , according to hsieh 's audit , to support election campaigns of provincial assemblymen , to support the election campaign of current president lee teng - hui , to pay business expenses for james soong , to establish a scholarship fund for students to go the university of california at berkeley , and to support soong chen - yuan in his studies and business activities in the us .
a final version of hsieh 's findings is to be provided to the investigating authorities .
however , chen pi - yun provided no reasonable explanation of the key question : why were public funds mixed up with and deposited along with private funds in the soong family 's private accounts ?
soong , who participated in hsieh 's press conference , then declared that the mixing of public and private funds was done on the orders of party chairman lee teng - hui for purposes of " security , reliability , secrecy , and avoiding trouble . "
after the hsieh - chen - soong press conference , the kmt held its own .
party spokesperson huang hui - chen said that the kmt had never officially authorized soong to have or use these funds , and that soong was suspected of embezzlement .
a judicial investigation will be required to look into this . so how did all this start ? on december 9 legislator yang chi - hsiung held a press conference at which he stated that soong chen - yuan had opened a securities trading account at chung hsing bills finance , that in december of 1992 , soong chen - yuan purchased nt$ 106 million in securities , and that as of the date of the press conference , there was more than nt$ 140 million in securities in the account . yang wondered how soong chen - yuan , who had just graduated from university , could possess such a large amount of wealth .
james soong thereafter stated that after his son had gone abroad to study and start a business , a benevolent " elder " opened an account which would allow the younger soong to withdraw funds from the interest as needed . over the years , there was no special need for the money , and last june nt$ 140 million was returned . as for who this " elder " is , soong would not say . but scepticism persisted .
on december 15 , soong held a press conference at which he stated that the account in his son 's name was set up under the direction of kmt party chairman lee teng - hui . he said that nt$ 146,460,000 was transferred from the special account of the kmt secretary - general and deposited in accounts under the names of soong chen - yuan and chen pi - yun . the money was designated , said soong , to take care of the descendants of former president chiang ching - kuo , and for " party tasks " specially designated by the chairman .
soong said that the amounts announced by yang were inaccurate . soong held a second press conference on december 18 .
this time he declared only that the money had been intended for looking after the chiang family . on december 21 , legislator yang held his third press conference , in which he stated that soong 's sister - in - law , chen pi - yun , had , in a half - month period at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995 , used nt$ 470 million in cash to purchase bonds and securities at chung hsing .
under pressure from the public and legislators , on december 22 minister of finance chiu announced partial results of their investigation , as mentioned above . this in turn sparked soong to ask hsieh chi - ta for another audit . there have been no firm conclusions as yet .
the chung hsing case may or may not be fully clarified , but it has certainly greatly affected james soong 's public support . before the scandal broke , he was getting more than 30 % support in public opinion polls , but a december 20 poll by the china times shows soong with only 23 % . this leaves him behind chen shui - bian -lrb- 24 % -rrb- and barely ahead of lien chan -lrb- 22 % -rrb- .
yet , while soong 's support has fallen , that of chen and lien has not markedly increased . obviously former soong supporters are now taking a wait - and - see attitude .
there 's a final point worth reflecting on : this is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the roc . yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . there 's little discussion of public policy . for example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on china policy and constitutional reform issued by chen shui - bian .
what is wrong with taiwan 's democratic culture ? do the public and media need to reassess ?
after all , in the new millennium , there will be many more tests facing us . p. 41 the chung hsing securities case has seriously damaged the image of independent presidential candidate james soong . the photo shows soong explaining the source of the funds at a december 14 press conference .
tears that smile - huang chun - ming 's letting them go -lrb- yang chao / photos by pu hua - chih / tr. scott williams -rrb-
after more than ten years of silence , a new collection of stories from huang chun - ming is a major event , and not just in literary circles . for readers who have been anticipating a new collection for years , the publication of letting them go is big news .
after such a long " hibernation , " how does this new work compare to huang 's previous works ?
sinorama invited the literary critic yang chao to provide our readers with the in - depth review which follows .
huang chun - ming 's use of fiction to express his concern for the elderly has a long history .
" cheng - tsai gets off the bus , " huang 's earliest published work , is the tale of an elderly woman taking her grandson to the city to visit her daughter and son - in - law . although she is " only 50 , " " her withered face was deeply etched by life and the passage of time . . . giving people the impression that she was in her 60s . "
what really marks her as elderly is not her visage , however , but her inability to carry out a task as simple as catching a bus into the city , and the apprehensive feelings she harbors towards the " cold , unfamiliar " city and the unknown future .
rural aesthetics the title of " an irrational old man " makes it plain that it too is a story about an elderly person .
here , however , huang has written about a different sort of senior citizen , one who carries within himself a traditional wisdom uncorrupted by modern education .
this wisdom , extremely practical in nature , is part of a piecemeal oral tradition . it is non-systematic and lacks mechanisms with which to check its own validity .
nonetheless , when taken as a whole it presents the ideas that there are spirits in the earth and sky , and that the universe is an organic and connected whole .
this is the elderly 's perspective on the universe , and it gives them very different ideas about meaning and beauty .
in dialogue with his grandson ah - ming , the " irrational old man " passes on his old knowledge : listen to the sound of the waves the wind makes in the rice paddies to discover if the rice is ripe ; fill the bellies of grasshoppers with salt before grilling them ; sparrows are ghosts or spirits which understand human speech ; and killing the lu ti bird brings floods .
at the end , the old man tells the boy of the spirit of the choshui river , which searches for people to take its place .
in " an irrational old man , " the reader feels very strongly that huang chun - ming is playing two roles : that of a little boy listening intently to his grandfather and that of a mature author who longs for the past and wishes to give voice to its earthy old knowledge .
ah - sheng is the unforgettable elderly protagonist of " drowning an old cat , " the next story in the collection .
ah - sheng does n't have the life of ease of the " irrational old man , " and he stubbornly resists the encroachment of his enemy , modern life .
in this tragic story , ah - sheng is ultimately steamrollered by the massive momentum of the new .
but while the tragedy plays itself out , huang makes it clear to the reader that he stands firmly on the side of ah - sheng in this conflict . not everything in the story is bleak , however . huang includes several comic and even farcical scenes , one of which occurs during a carnivalesque town meeting .
there , ah - sheng demonstrates a startling ability to respond to circumstances and succeeds in wrecking the meeting hall as he makes an eloquent speech on the love of one 's family and birthplace , making " the entire village jump to its feet in agitation . "
and there is a farcical moment at the end as he takes off his clothes and jumps into a private swimming pool , making the ultimate protest by taking his own life . old people " let go " by the modern era
this theme of tragedy resulting from changing times has appeared in huang 's earlier work , in " cymbal , " for example , which was strongly influenced by lu xun 's the story of ah q . in " cymbal , " the age of the protagonist , foolish chin , is unclear , but the theme of obsolescence remains .
chin 's work - making announcements in the street while using a cymbal to attract attention - has been made obsolete by the spread of the megaphone , undercutting his social status and taking away his livelihood .
chin thus takes on the role of a member of the older generation who has lost his struggle to make the transition to modern reality . of necessity , his misfortune and his way of thinking have a very " old ' character . there are reasons to look back to huang 's early work . the first is to point out that letting them go - in which the protagonist of every story is an elderly person - is entirely of a piece with his other work . in fact , it is a return to the main thread of his concerns of 30 years ago .
in the extremely nationalistic atmosphere of the 1970s , huang changed his focus for a time , writing about the hatred of japan -lrb- sayonara , goodbye -rrb- and about anti-american sentiments -lrb- i love mary -rrb- .
although well received at the time they were written , these works were flawed . first , they lacked the fine composition of true literature . second , in them huang had moved away from his greatest strength , the characters and settings with which he was truly familiar . as a result , huang 's 1970s writings were simply records of the period in which they were written and creative experiments .
they are interesting in their own way , but are by no means among his best works . two generations removed the second reason to look back at huang 's early fiction is to highlight the continuity of letting them go .
although it has been more than ten years since huang 's last collection of fiction , and in spite of the fact that 37 years separate " cheng - tsai gets off the bus " and " ticket window , " there is something at the core of huang 's fiction which has not changed .
in his introduction to letting them go , huang mentions his deep distress at the plight of the elderly in taiwan today , notes that he himself is just beginning to enter his twilight years , and compares taiwan 's callous treatment of the elderly to the way in which the elderly were left to live or die on their own in the mountains in you shan jie kao . all of this could very easily give the reader the mistaken impression that huang 's vision of the elderly is a new development .
but this is simply not the case .
in letting them go , what we are actually seeing is the rebirth of huang 's original passion .
if there has been any change in his portrayal of old people over the last 37 years , it is only in perspective . he used to write of grandfathers from the point of view of grandsons . now he is a grandfather himself .
huang chun - ming has often discussed the fact that he was raised largely by his grandparents , and that he had an unusually close relationship to them .
this background accounts for the unique " generation gap " approach utilized by huang in his fiction .
each of huang 's works describes a particular person or thing , and has an " implied reader " at which it is directed .
in the past , huang 's " generation gap " separated him from the people he was writing about - people of his grandparents ' generation , two generations removed from his own .
now , this " generation gap " stands between him and the " implied reader " of his fiction - children of his grandchildren 's generation who are ignorant of traditional wisdom . another aspect of huang 's work is that it presents many of the characteristics sociology attributes to relationships between people two generations removed from one another .
for example , such relationships are not usually as tense , direct or hurried as those between parents and children because grandparents are not as busy as parents , and have less responsibility to supervise and teach .
also , difficulties in communication between grandparents and grandchildren frequently arise because of the very different modes of expression employed by each .
as a result , there are typically more miscommunications in such relationships than there are between parents and their children .
a soft heart
viewing huang 's fiction in this way , we can perhaps more clearly see wherein lies its charm . huang is never derisive or critical of his elderly characters .
if we compare him to other nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .
other nativist writers use stories of suffering and pitiable elderly persons to make the case for reform . huang takes a much gentler approach - not because he thinks the modern world a perfect place , but because he can not bear to be so harsh . huang 's tender - heartedness is apparent to the reader of his work .
in his fiction , huang is both more sensitive to and places greater importance on the elderly 's haphazard means of expressing affection than are other nativist writers . " fish , " one of his early works , has become very widely known since being incorporated into the national middle - school literature curriculum .
the story describes an unexpected conflict that arises out of a misunderstanding between a child and a grandfather who care deeply for one another .
similar sorts of emotions are expressed in " letting them go " as well .
in this later story , the elderly ah - wei inexplicably goes out and catches an egret , then just as inexplicably lets it go .
both of these actions are indirect expressions of a deep love he can not give voice to yet nonetheless feels for his son wen - tung . a smile and a tear when huang writes of sad events , his readers ' eyes really do fill with tears .
however , the most exceptional thing about huang as a writer is that he is not satisfied with making his readers cry . he wants every tear that falls to be accompanied by a small smile . and he is able to have it both ways because of the deep and tender sympathy of his work .
the stories in letting them go are filled with elderly characters .
some are ignorant and suffer , like the old woman of " cheng - tsai gets off the bus . "
but more of them are , like the protagonist of the " irrational old man , " full of a wisdom unsuited to the times in which they live .
their tragedy is that they are out of step with the times , that they do not know how to adapt to this cold and chaotic new society .

taiwanese tv gets taiwanized !
eric lin / tr. by phil newell
recently the 8:00 p.m. serials being shown on television in taiwan have shown a trend toward " taiwanization . " three out of the four main broadcast stations are showing prime - time taiwanese drama , and these are pulling in nearly three - quarters of the viewing audience . of these programs , fortune is in heaven 's hands , broadcast by formosa television , stands at the top of the heap .
it is said that , along with pop music , prime - time tv serials are one of the most important elements of taiwanese popular culture , and that they reflect social trends .
what then is the relationship between the rise of taiwanese drama -lrb- that is , mainly in the taiwanese dialect and focused on the lives of distinctly taiwanese - as opposed to " mainlander " - characters -rrb- and contemporary society and culture in taiwan ?
do these shows reflect the real lives and aspirations of the audience ?
and what kinds of limitations exist ?
" mama ! do n't beat me any more ! mama ! " little ho - ho , a student at the yungho wanghsi primary school , is showing off to his aunt some taiwanese - language lines he learned from television .
ho - ho is a typical child of a northern taiwan mainlander family -lrb- i.e. a family which came to taiwan from mainland china only after wwii -rrb- . because he spoke only mandarin chinese at home and at school , he did n't really know any taiwanese until recently . but in the last couple of years his taiwanese has improved dramatically , thanks to the 8:00 p.m. serials .
ho - ho 's guardian , his aunt tsui mei - lan , bemoans the fact that " taiwan 's prime - time shows are violent , and even the love stories have people constantly slapping each other and arguing violently , so they are really not suitable for small children . " but when ho - ho told her that he wanted to watch these programs every evening in order to learn taiwanese , tsui , who all her life has experienced the problems of not being able to speak or understand taiwanese , found it hard to refuse . the child 's rapid success at picking up taiwanese has amazed her .
the revival of reality little ho - ho 's line - " do n't beat me any more ! " - reflects one of the more common themes of tv shows done in taiwanese .
beating of children , often by an evil stepmother , is not unusual . this is not because taiwanese are especially firm believers in corporal punishment .
rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to taiwanese drama over the course of its history . as a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes - playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart - strings - are still common .
" taiwanese serials depict the daily life of ordinary people the way they do because of their development process , " says ko yu - fen , an associate professor of mass communications at shih hsin university , who has done a study of taiwan tv drama . " and now , because of the trend in society of reviving taiwanese as the mother tongue , taiwanese drama has been able to leap into prime time to become the mainstream offering in the past few years . " the 8:00 p.m. time slot has long been the flagship and leading money maker for television stations .
for a program to get into this slot , besides being commercially viable , in the past it also had to be politically correct . this used to mean : " no use of the taiwanese language . " because the government wanted to promote mandarin , taiwanese was officially seen as a rustic dialect , and was never eligible for prime time .
the three government - run television stations of that era - china television -lrb- ctv -rrb- , chinese television service -lrb- cts -rrb- , and taiwan television -lrb- ttv -rrb- - had a tacit agreement that they would only show taiwanese programs at noon or in the 6:30 p.m. time slot , when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people .
the programming for these time slots was low - budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters - in - law and the like , or family comedies . thus , for a long time , taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow . it was not until 1990 , with the broadcasting of the series love on cts , that the prime - time language taboo was even partly challenged . this series also raised the quality of taiwanese drama , and planted the seeds for future efforts . the show was set against the background of the august 7th flood of 1959 . the story portrayed how some taiwanese and mainlanders went from mutual misunderstanding to mutual forgiveness . the performers spoke in both mandarin and taiwanese .
because the language taboo has long carried heavy political undertones - the opposition has always preferred the use of taiwanese , the ruling party has , until recently , almost exclusively favored mandarin - the producers invited many people from the arts community to confirm that taiwanese was essential for the program , so as to dispel the suspicions of those who would see political motives behind language choice . unfortunately , the effort was less than a complete success . for one thing , stereotypes remained strong , and love still retained many of the old traditions , being a tragic small family drama focusing on a young bride facing hard times after moving into the husband 's home . moreover , because of opposition from high officials at the television network , after several episodes , the performers who had previously spoken in taiwanese had their dialogue changed to " mandarin with a taiwanese accent . "
however , because the plot was realistic , ratings were unprecedented , and love even defeated widow 's watch , based on a novel by , and also produced by , the vastly popular romance writer chiung yao , and broadcast on ctv . at that time , many commentators suggested that love was successful largely because of the use of taiwanese .
but lin ling - ling , a script writer for widow 's watch , says that the real reason love succeeded was because of its realistic depiction of the lives of taiwanese . her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and chiung yao 's series departed too far from reality .
this in fact has been a chronic problem of taiwan 's dramatic serials . " love succeeded largely because it wedded realism to taiwanese subject matter . politics in command ? however , though the series was popular , it did not immediately spark a wave of enthusiasm for taiwanese subject matter .
the government around that time adopted a policy of allowing producers to go to mainland china to film , and there was a sudden craze for martial arts series and love stories framed against a mainland backdrop .
still , television stations and producers had awakened to the existence of an audience for " nativist " taiwanese drama . after the qingdao lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . this time they went right at major political taboos like the february 28 incident of 1947 .
writer lin ling - ling used the white terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime - time drama in taiwan television history - taiwan outlaws of the marsh . it was so popular that its producer , hsu chin - liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme . lin explains : " i always want to write a taiwanese drama against the backdrop of great events , and the february 28 incident was at that time just beginning to get intensive open discussion , so there was a lot of commercial viability as well . " owing to the series ' popularity , lead actor lun hsiao - hua has become a major television star , while female lead chen mei - feng established her image as a traditional taiwanese woman of gentility and virtue , and has since gotten numerous roles and television commercials .
however , says lin with a laugh , things did n't go exactly as she expected . " because the writer , director , and actors all had different political orientations , after the first several episodes which laid out the background of the era were produced , the plot shifted toward traditional family relations and romance , along the lines of the typical prime - time serial . " the series was nonetheless a watershed . taiwanese was no longer taboo , and indeed identification with " taiwanese-ness " came to be highly admired . ko yu - fen states that it is not difficult to understand these trends against the backdrop of society at that time . taiwan outlaws of the marsh was broadcast just after the first direct popular elections for municipal mayors and provincial governor , when the " underground " call - in television programs were at their peak of popularity , and when discussion of " taiwanese identity " was at a fever pitch .
hsu hsiao - tsu , a former aide to the legislative caucus of the democratic progressive party , recalls that although taiwan outlaws of the marsh did not go very deeply into the historical facts and controversies of the february 28 incident , he and his friends , enthusiastic student activists in the opposition movement , felt that it was of great symbolic importance that prime - time television - which had always represented conservative values - was broadcasting a series on this subject using both taiwanese and mandarin . he laughs , " even though i usually do n't have any interest in watching tv , at that time we tuned in at eight sharp every night , as a kind of moral support . " ko yu - fen says , however , that times have changed . linguistic and historical conditions politicized taiwanese drama .
there had always been controversy over it . but the political significance faded , and , with the daughter - in - law series beginning in 1995 , taiwanese drama became embroiled in a very different controversy - that it was oversimplified and stereotypical , and that the clock had been turned back to the early days of taiwanese - language programming . the daughter - in - law series was a collection of all - taiwanese - language stories broadcast by cts , describing the relationship between daughters - in - law and mothers - in - law in taiwan 's traditional rural society . the first of the series , the astonishing daughter - in - law , got an enthusiastic audience response , and the show , which like all prime - time serials was broadcast nightly monday to friday , lasted for nearly a year . the hard - pressed daughter in law the story of the astonishing daughter - in - law is quite simple . the daughter - in - law , played by chang yu - yen , is mistreated by her mother - in - law , and , with outsiders butting in and causing trouble , she gets abused from beginning to end .
yet she maintains her traditional womanly virtues , never fights back , and in the end is rewarded with a happy ending .
although chang does not speak taiwanese very well , her pitiable demeanor won a lot of sympathy from the audience . juan chin - jung , a changhua county civil servant and longtime fan of tv serials , says critically , " it drove me nuts watching the daughter - in - law just sit there and take abuse from her mother - in - law day in and day out .
also , the costumes and sets were so crude , there was no difference from a typical 6:30 show . " yet , she says , her grandmother was in tears every day , explaining that young women today could never understand the suffering and indignities endured by daughters - in - law in the past . ko yu - fen ascribes the success of the daughter - in - law series to several factors :
" by playing on people 's heart strings , using taiwanese language , and being set against the background of that bitter era , the daughter - in - law series brought together all the traditional elements of the taiwanese drama , but in addition added new structure and packaging , and integrated the spiciness and conflict typical of an 8:00 show .
no wonder it was so successful . " lin ling - ling says that criticism of 8:00 serials for being melodramatic is certainly not without foundation , yet , however people may criticize , there are still viewers who ca n't get enough . the audience is composed mainly of older folk and housewives . in general , they do n't want to watch something they have to really think too much about . the simpler the characters and the plot , and the more conflict there is , the better . lin adds that intellectuals criticize such shows but in fact do n't watch tv .
television stations have always based their decisions on ratings , and it is virtually impossible to expect that they will change a proven formula . " rather than say that serials are a mirror of life , it would be better to say that people identify with the characters in these dramas even if their own lives are not as dramatic . "
these are the terms used by tsai yen , a professor in the department of broadcasting and television at national chengchi university . this is particularly the case for older people and housewives . according to tsai , the formula for success revolves around romance or family relations . for dramatic effect , there need to be elements of hatred or revenge , and usually one irredeemably evil character whose purpose is to create obstacles to the romantic or career success of the main character .
the focus is extremely narrow - personal achievement . social issues serve only as background or embellishment . the daughter - in - law series precisely fits this structure . realistic fashion after the daughter - in - law series , there was a uniformity in dramatic serials all following the trend . taiwanese drama went into a steady decline . however , just when things looked bleakest , nativist drama began to break out of its previous framework with the appearance of the " river of time " structure , characterized by a cross-generational story depicting long - term social evolution in taiwan .
this format incorporates the rural themes of traditional taiwanese drama , but the stories evolve with time , and also portray modern urban life .
not only has this format given new life to taiwanese drama , it has also pioneered an entirely new type of television drama - contemporary realism . formosa television had enthusiastic audiences for springtime stepmother 's heart in 1998 . the character of actress pai ping - ping played against the stereotype of the abusive stepmother , instead being a woman who brings two of her own children into a marriage into a wealthy family .
she has to deal on the one hand with the lack of understanding from her mother - in - law and on the other look after four children from different families as well as the husband 's first wife , who suffers from mental illness . and after financial setbacks , she also has to support the whole family .
because the series was so popular , ftv seized the opportunity and presented a sequel based on the loves and hates of the third generation , which , as expected , also was very well received .
springtime stepmother 's heart pulled ftv financially out of the red and into the black , and is considered an extremely remarkable event in taiwan television history .
executive chairman chen kang - hsin proudly calls the new format developed by ftv " contemporary drama . " lien chang - yu , a senior reporter covering film and tv for the united daily news , explains that ftv has been successful in the 8:00 time slot not only because " the use of taiwanese language fits right in with the trends of the times , " but also because " the inclusion of little conversations and incidents that occur in everyday life makes these series accessible and familiar to the viewers . " that tv stations agree can be seen from the most recent offering from ftv , fortune is in heaven 's hands , which offers a realistic depiction of urban life .
fortune is also cross-generational . the story begins with the death of the husband of the main female character . she struggles to raise her infant son , and is a frequent target of criticism from her mother - in - law .
the son then grows into adulthood , and all the feelings - gratitude , revenge , love , hate - of the older generation carry on into the younger . in the city the children help each other and compete against each other as the story grows increasingly explosive . the combination of traditional taiwanese and contemporary factors has made the show a hit . lien chang - yu says that recently three of the four broadcast stations have been showing taiwanese drama , but ftv 's ratings stand alone , far ahead of all the others .
a show can not be popular simply by using taiwanese language , she says - the audience must be able to identify with it . this is how the series real love from hong kong cable tv has stayed so popular that it has run uninterrupted for several years . on programming
the success of serials means that tv stations in taiwan just keep on cranking them out , broadcasting episodes as quickly as they are shot . this special feature of taiwan 's 8:00 time slot means that one can naturally not be too picky about quality .
lu hsiao - fen , a film star who has won numerous awards at the golden horse and asia - pacific film festivals and who has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in fortune , explains : " they have a special name for shows that are being broadcast episode by episode as each one is shot : ' on programming . '
it is common for an episode finished today to be shown two days later . " she finds this situation less than ideal . she says that in order to keep up with the audience 's ever - changing tastes , scripts are being rewritten right up to the last minute . naturally television actors do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy of allowing themselves time to slowly get in the right frame of mind for a role or scene , but even so , given the fact that tv actors must rely almost exclusively on dialogue and body language to keep the audience 's attention , the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down the quality of the performance , there is little time even to get the lines right .
such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges . chou you , who has produced more than 4,000 hours of dramatic series for television , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations . sometimes the producer ca n't call the shots . personally , she has always preferred to begin broadcasting only after the entire series has been completed , to ensure quality control .
but if a series is doing well , the station will want to extend it , and if ratings are less than ideal , the series must be prepared to wrap up at any moment .
the series on which chou has recently been working had the final rushes confiscated by the network so that it can decide how to edit them , in order to determine how long the series will actually run . " even i do n't know when it will come to an end , " she says with exasperation .
pop merchandise
april chu , the producer of fortune is in heaven 's hands , admits that on programming is a real bottleneck for taiwanese drama . but there is no quick - fix . with the practical environment being what it is , people will simply have to think their way out of its limitations .
" on programming is simply the way taiwan television works . if the station strategy is set up that way , it 's unlikely they will change . the only solution is through restructuring of the content , strengthening the rhythms , reducing the use of pointless patter to draw out the series , improving the dramatic structure , and adding new vitality to the roles . "
but how ? she takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned . twenty years ago , she wrote a tv serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle - aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man .
society was shocked from top to bottom . today , as she produces fortune , she still devotes special attention to the molding of the women 's roles . from the character of the grandmother to that of the daughter , she insists that the script give them independent and strong - willed vitality .
she says , " although you can say that prime time serials are merchandise and not art , you have to present up - to - date positive values .
you have to be responsible to the audience , and that 's also the key to continual innovation . "
developing overseas markets taiwanese television serials have always sold well abroad . but some people are concerned that an overemphasis on taiwanese themes and language will stifle the development of overseas sales .
" by nature , television drama is very localized . because of cultural differences , overseas audiences will not necessarily like the same things taiwan audiences do , " says reporter lien chang - yu . that is why many " blue - chip " producers who control overseas copyrights are unwilling to touch nativist serials .
they prefer to do martial arts or love stories that focus on no particular era or social backdrop . lin ling - ling , on the other hand , believes that taiwanese drama should have no problems holding its own against competition from other areas . she says that hong kong drama generally maintains good pacing , but the way they handle dialogue , content , and emotion is not very convincing . prc tv provides dramas which interpret actual historical events -lrb- as opposed to taiwan 's " historical " dramas which are mainly just made - up stories in period costume -rrb- , but they are too slow - moving .
japanese tv relies mostly on packaging of well - known " idols , " with most of the effort going into the aesthetics of presentation , and little emphasis on storyline . taiwan television drama , on the other hand , has conflict and intensity , and if it is well packaged , it should do well in the overseas market .
" you ca n't say that there 's no overseas market for drama just because it is nativist taiwanese . after all , hong kong drama series have dominated the asian market for years , yet they also use a chinese dialect - cantonese - and are also set against the backdrop of their own hong kong society .
however , due to the strength of their entertainment industry , they 've been able to penetrate everywhere , " says tsai yen .
taiwan can learn from this experience . talent flow
as interactions between taiwan and the prc have grown , over the past few years there have been many cases of cooperative filming involving taiwan , hong kong and mainland china , or of the hiring of technicians or performers from one area to work in another .
for example , for the martial arts dramas of yang pei - pei , the scripts and actors come from taiwan , the director and the costume designer are from hong kong , and the series are filmed in the prc using mainland technicians . technically speaking , they are extremely well done . the same goes for chiung yao 's romantic dramas . however , given the different cultural backgrounds of these people , there are limits to cooperation , and if you factor in political considerations , that makes the situation even more complex .
" cross-national cooperation is the fastest way to get an infusion of fresh blood , but it is not a long - term solution , " says lien chang - yu . recently the prc has begun to limit the number of people who can work in cooperative projects in order to protect its own tv industry , and sudden changes such as this will inevitably have an impact . prime time programming has long been a weaver of dreams for taiwanese audiences .
but there is a huge difference between today 's society and that of 30 years ago . if the dreams woven by the serials stay the same , or are even inferior , inevitably the audience will decline . given the ever growing pluralization of society in taiwan , these shows must find new talent , overcome formulaic stories , and halt the decline in audience share . those in the industry must figure out how to draw people back .
p. 87 so - called " on programming " - meaning that series episodes are shot right before the time of broadcast - is a special feature of taiwan 's prime - time televised serials . the advantage is that the story can be changed or the series extended or shortened depending upon ratings . the disadvantage is that quality may suffer .

chinese new year 's eve - doing it the modern way with celebrations for the long - anticipated start of the year 2000 barely over , chinese people began busily preparing to mark another new year . " spring festival , " as it is known , brings a longer break from work - compared with western new year - and is an altogether more meaningful occasion for the chinese .
amid today 's sweeping tide of modernization , spring festival is probably the only annual occasion left with a truly " chinese " flavor .
so how do people celebrate chinese new year nowadays ?
how much of the ancient form of the festival survives , and what new elements have been added in our time ?
under the crisp and pleasant skies of late december , mrs. pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties -lrb- 24 kg -rrb- of streaky pork . when the meat arrives she chops it into one - catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry - fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and gaoliang liquor .
after several days of preparation , the result is larou , or end - of - year cured meat . there 's still over one month to go before spring festival , but as mrs. pu explains : " it takes a fairly long time to make larou , and you have to make allowance for the weather . it 's best to get going early so that you have the meat ready to give out to friends and relatives in time for new year . "
her ever - popular larou is made in accordance with a time - tested recipe . she adds the spices in their special proportions , and then seals the meat in a vat to marinate for six days so as to ensure a full flavor .
after being removed from the vat the strips are slowly smoked over a mixture of sugarcane bark , charcoal , orange peel and rice husks , until they have acquired a lovely luster and exude a delicious aroma . finally the cured strips are hung out for two or three days in the sun to draw off excess fat .
for mrs. pu and her husband , the traditional lunar new year has more significance than the western version .
it provides the opportunity for making food in the traditional style of their home region , much of which they give to others , and also brings the whole family together for an eagerly awaited celebration . new year 's eve dinner is the highlight , with three generations - more than ten hungry mouths - gathered for the feast . " we need at least ten new year dishes , " says mrs. pu .
in addition to servings of chicken , duck , fish and pork , they always have some of the specialties of her husband 's home region , anhui province in mainland china , including yuanzi meatballs -lrb- minced pork blended with chopped spring onion , ginger , garlic and rice noodles , rolled in cornstarch flour and deep - fried -rrb- .
other favorites such as pearl balls -lrb- meatballs wrapped in sticky rice -rrb- , pork knuckle in brown sauce , and mixed vegetables , dishes that mr. and mrs. pu like to make for themselves and others all year round , also appear at the table , all cooked with extra special attention for new year . in fact , preparations for the feast begin three or four days before the event itself . slowly warming up
the timing of chinese new year is determined by the traditional lunar calendar and marks an important transition , the point when winter gives way to spring . in china , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . as this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year .
thus new year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle . while underpinning the annual cycle of festivals and the daily routine of the people , new year also , through its religious - type observances , came to express chinese people 's ideas about life , nature , and clan society . the attitudes and lifestyles of the chinese are also given full expression through the various activities that take place during the holiday .
traditions such as sweeping the house to " drive out the old and bring in the new , " venerating the gods , making offerings to ancestors , having the whole family eat together and stay up late on new year 's eve , calling on friends and relatives on new year 's day , and - for married women - visiting their parents on the following day .
in spite of the changes wrought by modernization , which make it impossible for the new year to be celebrated in exactly the way that it used to be , and regardless of the simplifications that have taken place , spring festival remains the longest and most important holiday in the calendar . it is , as ever , a time of plenty and of family reunion - a great occasion for everyone . homeland of the soul
food is an obsession with the chinese , and never more so than at new year when virtually every family - like mrs. pu 's in taoyuan - enjoys one or two dishes prepared to their own " private " recipe , plus other edible treats with special symbolism . for most people , dishes such as these are forever bound up with the spirit of new year .
writer lin wen - yueh has penned numerous articles on the culture of food and drink in recent years , including a vignette -lrb- from her collection of essays epicurean notes -rrb- about new year with the family , entitled " luobo pudding . " " when the chinese do new year , one type of specialty is indispensable : new year pudding . . . .
however , as china covers such a vast territory , this pudding comes in different versions according to region . for example , people in the belt south of the yangtze river generally eat " ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from guangdong and the southern fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip -lrb- luobo -rrb- and long - grain rice . as lin writes : " although my family moved around a lot when i was little , mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every new year to make luobo pudding for the whole family . so when we spent new year in shanghai , we did n't have ningpo pudding like the rest of the people there , and when we were in tokyo we did n't have the " mirror cake " that they like in japan .
no matter where we were , it was always luobo pudding for us . " lin recalls that there were so many mouths to feed at new year that they had to use two or three large bamboo steamers to make the puddings .
come new year , the children were always attracted by the unusually busy atmosphere in the kitchen , and loved running in and out to check on what was going on , meanwhile getting under everyone 's feet .
lin 's mother was n't too happy about this , and the kitchen helpers would impatiently wave the kids away , calling : " shoo ! shoo ! go outside and play ! " however , as lin grew up , her mother would call her and the other girls to her side to watch and help out .
she said : " follow closely , now . one day i 'll be gone , and you 'll have to do this all by yourselves . "
making luobo pudding is a demanding process and requires plenty of ingredients . nowadays there 's no need to wait for new year - the pudding can be sampled throughout the year at hong kong - style dimsum restaurants or bought readymade in the market . but come the last month in the lunar calendar , lin wen - yueh still prepares several luobo puddings the old - fashioned way , so that her family and friends can enjoy new year pudding " the way mama used to make it . "
difficult time of year
nowadays it is n't so easy to recreate the elaborate new years of the past . the speeded - up , stripped - down pace of modern life has reduced the event in scale , and people now regard new year in different ways according to how it fits in with their lives .
surveys show that among the chinese , new year is ranked as one of the most stressful facets of life .
a tale from the past shows how new year has always been a source of financial pressure for families .
during the ming dynasty -lrb- 1368 - 1644 -rrb- , a fuzhou prefectural magistrate named cai junmo issued an order for every family in the district to light seven lanterns for lantern festival -lrb- the 15th day of the first lunar month -rrb- .
one of the residents of the prefecture , a man named chen lie , satirized the magistrate 's order with a verse that he painted on a large lantern :
" in the homes of the rich , lanterns are as plentiful as rice in the granary /
in the homes of the poor , a single lantern reduces fathers and sons to misery /
the carefree magistrate may not be aware of this / and simply complains that the music is n't good enough . "
in the haifeng area of guangdong province , there is a saying to describe the hardship that the holiday brings for the poor - whom the festival often relieved of a whole year 's worth of painstakingly accumulated surplus : " those with money celebrate new year ; those without money get stripped bare . " this was especially so given that the " close of the year " was also the time when creditors turned up to claim their dues and " close " their accounts .
chen chih - fan , the scientist and well - known essayist , once described how he , as the eldest son in a poor family , used to spend the days before new year writing and selling spring couplets in the market , so as to help his father pay off debts and buy goodies for his siblings .
on account of his skill at calligraphy , chen spent many a new year in this fashion . as a successful scholar he was later able to recall this episode with pride , yet the bitterness and hurt still showed through in his words . tough work , year after year on top of economic pressures , new year , for many housewives , brings the added burden of endless household chores .
in the past , this meant a nonstop round of house cleaning , making pudding , doing the new year shopping and making new clothes , starting from the 8th day of the 12th lunar month .
there was also the matter of performing the prescribed observances to heaven and earth , the ancestors , the kitchen god and various other deities . things are simpler nowadays , but putting together a new year dinner to fill the bellies of everyone in the family still presents an enormous culinary and physical challenge .
for those who live far from the parental home , there 's the added trial of transport conditions - congested roads , fully - booked trains and airplanes - to foil the plans of all who would hurry home in time to spend new year 's eve with the clan . and if you live in a large family with plenty of old folk and youngsters - all expecting red envelopes of cash - your hard - earned year - end bonus may well be gone by the time new year is over .
in recent years , new year has increasingly shown up on the agenda of the women 's movement .
many women now object to the tradition of spending new year 's eve with the family of their spouse , rather than at the homes of their own parents , and point out that this is one of the nasty little legacies of a patriarchal society , something which goes against the modern principle of sex equality .
" i 'm an only daughter , and my father has passed away , so i really hate leaving mom to spend new year 's eve all alone . "
" when we go over to my husband 's family , it 's nothing but nonstop cleaning and cooking ! " these are some of the many complaints expressed by women writing to the letters pages in the press .
for many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion .
others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no - one has to worry about getting everything ready . for modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving new year . a bittersweet evening " the most scary thing is the deep - seated clan mentality of the chinese , " says li yuan , an author known for his writings on the topic of family . " it can tangle the relationship between parents and children into a never - unraveled web of pain and intimacy - which does n't always make for happy family reunions . "
no wonder new year 's eve is frequently a time of generational conflict . li describes the case of his own family .
his mother and father came from hakka backgrounds on the mainland , and as clan identity is strongly emphasized in hakka culture , his father used to require all his children and grandchildren to be at the family home for dinner on new year 's eve .
concerned about the burden on the old couple , li persuaded them to hold the annual get - together at his house , with dinner prepared by his wife and sisters .
striving valiantly to create a party atmosphere , li took a leaf out of " old laizi 's " book , -lrb- old laizi was a legendary paragon of filial piety who acted like a child well into his seventies just to keep his parents amused -rrb- , dreaming up little pranks with the help of his children .
for example , they gave mischievous names to each of the dishes served for new year 's eve dinner , like " dongfang the invincible 's chopped - off willy , " " the flower of guanyin 's slender waist , " and " sea cucumber , squid and meatballs - a three - in - one world . " " the mood of good cheer and togetherness at new year can indeed leave some heart - warming memories , " acknowledges li yuan . " but the occasion can also dredge up less pleasant associations from the past . "
during new year 's eve six years ago , li 's father could n't stop himself getting worked up , in spite of the family 's best efforts to keep the mood light . dinner was nearly over when the old fellow demanded that his children come to his side , and announced : " i want to square up accounts with every one of you , each in turn . . . . " he began to lecture them about how hard he had struggled in his youth to bring them all up , recalling every little incident as though it were yesterday . he broke down in tears once he got onto the things that had hurt him , and after that there was no calming him down . " he had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him . now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . "
li described the ensuing scenario : " some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine - gun approach . cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded . the old bruiser , nearly 80 years old , was struck speechless .
his authority lay in tatters , long since torn down by his adult offspring .
he 'd taken so many hits by then that he was riddled with bullet - holes . he slumped miserably back into his chair , lips quivering as if to speak , but no words coming from his mouth . " the evening ended in tears and awkwardness .
" our family was quite poor when we were growing up , " says li , " and father suffered plenty of frustrations on our behalf . he thought that we had n't properly repaid him once we had grown up , and felt quite bitter about it .
but he did n't realize that we too , growing up in such circumstances , faced hardship and frustration . like my elder sister who had to work her way through school . everyone had something to get off his chest .
it all got quite heated . " li felt depressed and guilty about the way the evening turned out . when he went over to his parents house the next day to pay his new year respects , he asked his children to help smooth things over , and he scrubbed clean the toilet bowl as penance . li yuan 's father passed away the year before last .
his mother , more relaxed about things than her husband , was n't concerned about doing a new year 's eve dinner , so last year the family cancelled the tradition . " mom decided to take a trip abroad .
my family and i like the unusual quiet that descends on taipei 's streets for the period of the festival , and since we did n't want to make any special arrangements , we just stayed home and had a good rest . "
a quiet new year " what we are missing , " says author yang hsiao - yun , " is a way of bringing new meaning into the old tradition , a way of spending new year that suits ordinary people . " yang 's strongest association with new year is of going to do the new year 's shopping with the grown - ups when she was little . " we were always very thrifty in those days , without extra cash for new things . new year was the only time when we got to bring bulging bags and packages back to the house . just the sight of all those treats - chicken , duck , fish and pork ; candies and cookies ; fruits and soda drinks - was a thrill for us .
then there were all the new year presents , like new clothes , shoes and hats . at new year our parents liked to dress the girls in red from head to toe , for good luck and for fun . we looked as if we 'd been dipped in a tub of haw juice . " in spite of the excitement that she remembered feeling , as a child , about getting to wear new clothes and new hats , yang later began to question this way of spending new year .
she felt especially turned off by the orgy of consumption connected with the festival . " it was only after i had kids of my own that i began to rethink the importance of new year - partly out of nostalgia , and partly to pass the tradition on to my children , " admits yang . nowadays she emphasizes just three aspects of the occasion : getting the family together , enjoying the festive spirit , and having a rest . " at one point we tried the fashionable thing , taking the family away for a vacation , but being abroad we really missed that festive flavor . " eventually she returned to the traditional form , making the new year 's eve dinner herself , and always including a manchurian - style pickled cabbage hotpot prepared just the way her parents used to do it . -lrb- her father hailed from liaoning province in mainland china . -rrb-
" with life as busy and stressful as it is the rest of the year , we decided to drop the formal new year gathering . instead , we now spend the time relaxing at home , doing whatever we fancy , be it sitting quietly and reading , listening to music , going on an outing , or talking about the ups and downs of the past year .
or we might invite a couple of close friends round to reminisce about old times . it 's quiet , and it 's really satisfying . " on the other hand , " continues yang , " the end of the year can also serve as a reminder for people to review their past actions . " she always sets aside a little time for herself on new year 's eve to do just this . as midnight approaches , and with all the household chores taken care of , yang settles down to quietly reflect on how she has grown during the past twelve months , and to draw up her personal " profit and loss sheet " for the year .
" it 's nothing to do with money , " she stresses . " it 's a way of measuring whether i 've achieved my objectives , in my work and in my personal maturity . i ask myself what my bad habits are . it 's a kind of new year 's eve dish for the spirit ! " yang feels that if we redefine new year in terms of its contemplative and spiritual meaning , rather than just regarding it as an occasion for feasting and partying , then we can better sense how time passes , and see that another phase in our working lives has been completed .
in this way we can make our wishes for the year ahead , setting goals for work and for personal growth , without getting maudlin about time 's passage and the meaninglessness of it all . for the chinese , the family is the basic unit for celebrating new year , but the family , like society , has been changing in recent years .
couples whose children have grown up and moved out , face the " empty nest syndrome , " while many individuals , particularly among the elderly , live on their own . however , for people like these , and for the homeless , there are still ways of enjoying " a good get - together " at new year . all together now
one month before last year 's chinese new year , artist wang cheng - liang placed some articles in the press seeking others like himself - single people with nothing special to do on new year 's eve - to register for a new year 's eve dinner and party at his studio . you did n't have to know anyone else going . plenty of people took up the offer , and the party was packed .
for wang , it was the most fun he 'd ever had at new year . lin wen - yueh moved to california once her children had grown up and started families of their own , so she can no longer spend new year with her immediate family .
but her enthusiasm for the festival has n't waned . " now i spend new year with friends who are in similar circumstances to me . each of us brings a dish for the meal , and makes his own contribution . it 's all very relaxed . " for lin , friendship is as heart - warming as family ties .
" new year is part of our shared cultural and ethnic memory . it 's a homeland of the soul for every one of us . the external form may have changed , but the memory of some inner yearning , that sense of needing to belong , these are things that can never change . "
for those often - overlooked old folk and street people , there are special new year dinners organized by private welfare groups , enabling them to share in the human warmth of the occasion .
last year the buddha 's light international association organized new year 's eve dinners in the north , center and south of taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . this year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in nantou county to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .
another group , the creation social welfare foundation - which is well known for its work with street people and for taking care of vegetative - state patients - runs an annual new year 's eve party for homeless people . " giving and serving , these too form part of the meaning and purpose of new year . "
the venerable yung fu of the buddha 's light international association hopes that today 's well - fed , well - clothed people of taiwan can extend the warmth and love of their own families out to society at large , and especially to those most in need of attention , so as to widen and elevate the meaning of new year .
it is no surprise that amid the hectic pace of modern life , some of the relaxed good fun has gone out of chinese new year .
but as a custom that has been part of the culture for so long , it continues to occupy a unique position in our hearts and lives .
what remains to be seen is how well we can adapt and update this ancient tradition to fit the changing needs of modern society .
last - minute legislative binge opens new era for defense , finance , and human
-lrb- jackie chen / tr. by phil newell -rrb- rights the second session of the fourth leg - islative yuan ended on january 15th . after government and opposition legislators burned the midnight oil for a whole week , 113 bills were passed . quantitatively , this was the most bills passed in a single session since 1948 .
but from the qualitative standpoint , there are many problems . in addition , the session saw a public scandal in which legislators have been suspected of using back - door channels to get state - run financial institutions to invest in private venture capital companies .
also , with the presidential elections fast approaching , many laws appeared intended to benefit a certain candidate . controversial legislation included : 1 .
regulations governing the distribution of expense account money to local elected representatives and village and neighborhood chiefs : these regulations greatly increase payments made to local executive and assembly officials . with the passage of this law , the budget for these expenses should be forced up from the current nt$ 4.4 billion to more than nt$ 7 billion .
besides being seen as a blatant handout to influence the presidential election , and a contradiction of government promises to eliminate the positions of these local officials -lrb- who are big players in political patronage networks -rrb- , the law also brought criticism from taipei and kaohsiung city councillors , whose salaries are cut by the bill . however , minister of the interior huang chu - wen insists that city councillors were amply consulted during the drafting process . 2 .
the law to encourage private - sector participation in public infrastructure projects : this law stipulates that the private sector may undertake bot projects -lrb- build , operate , and transfer to the government -rrb- for major public infrastructure , including development of new towns , major industrial enterprises , and high - tech facilities .
besides offering tax incentives , the new law will assist private investors to get beyond the limits of current law and invest in new land . indeed , it will even enable private investors to undertake compulsory land purchasing using government authority .
also , companies involved in major transportation infrastructure will be allowed to issue new stock or corporate debt to raise funds . this law should have a positive effect for current bot projects which are facing obstacles , including the high - speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to cks international airport . there will now be a legal basis for the high - speed railway to raise more capital .
also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the chang yi financial group can become reality .
however , some scholars have criticized this law for being poorly formulated and open to abuse .
yang chung - hsin , a researcher in the institute of economics at the academia sinica , says that to give financial groups and business operators the same powers as the government to requisition land can only be done if equal attention is given to fairness and efficiency ; otherwise , the interests of landowners will clash , and there will be endless disputes . 3 . regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : this law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market .
in the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital - the government will be able to draw on an nt$ 500 billion fund .
this law has been criticized by academics as a serious distortion of the market mechanism , as putting the policy makers into the position of being market players , and as inevitably creating opportunities for insider trading and the manipulation of the market to the benefit of a privileged few .
but president lee teng - hui and members of the cabinet have argued that taiwan 's stock market is too vulnerable to cross-strait developments , and this law will enable the government to stabilize the market - and thus domestic morale - in the event of crises like the 1996 prc missile tests .
4 . the national defense law and the organic law of the ministry of defense : the ndl will unify the administrative channel -lrb- previously handled by the ministry of defense -rrb- and the war - fighting chain of command -lrb- previously under the virtually autonomous general staff -rrb- . now the general staff will be clearly placed under the minister of defense , who will be a civilian . these changes mark a new era in roc military modernization .
the " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff .
the political warfare system -lrb- an autonomous system of political commissar - type officers , created in early republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders -rrb- will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change . though it remains to be seen if the political warfare system will retain its own officer corps and academy separate from the regular armed forces , minister of defense tang fei says that the ultimate goal is to unify all the officer corps . 5 . the coastal defense law and the organic law of the coast guard command : this will establish the coast guard as a ministerial level body , responsible for coastal defense and for combating smuggling and illegal immigration .
some say that this does not conform to the ideal of streamlining the government , and also say that it is very unusual to bring a front - line law enforcement agency into the cabinet .
also , the idea that the 22,000 - man coast guard will be represented in the cabinet , while the 70,000 - plus - man police force remains sub-ministerial , rankles among some police officers .
however , the executive yuan argues that taiwan 's coastal policing work also touches on national defense and sovereignty questions -lrb- with regard to the tiaoyutai or spratly islands , for example -rrb- .
a single unified body with sufficient rank is necessary to integrate these functions with coastal and shoreline law enforcement and fishing harbor inspections . 6 . regulations governing reconstruction in the wake of the september 21 earthquake : this law will govern reconstruction after the expiration of the original emergency decree .
it calls on the executive yuan to create a community reconstruction fund for damaged areas . urban renewal laws have been relaxed to offer incentives for people to rebuild . the legislation also arranges for children under 18 orphaned by the quake to receive a government - subsidized trust fund to pay for their living expenses and education .
also , people who had mortgages against their property prior to the earthquake , and whose homes have been officially confirmed as destroyed , will have the interest payments delayed for five years .
finally , there will be reduction of land and real estate taxes for homes in the disaster areas for a period not to exceed three years .
among the less controversial new legislation is the following :
legislation on soil and groundwater pollution will raise the penalties for such pollution , up to life imprisonment if the pollution leads to death . a fund will be established to clean up future cases of soil and groundwater contamination . the law governing compensation for wrongful imprisonment in the martial law era under charges such as subversion and spying has been broadened in applicability .
persons applying for such compensation will no longer be limited by the original two - year application deadline . also , the law governing temporary release from detention has been amended so that anyone being held for a crime that carries a sentence of five or more years , if released for medical treatment , may not engage in election campaigns or any activity not related to treatment , and must go back in to detention upon recovering .
another law offers protection to anyone who provides evidence in criminal or organized crime cases . finally , new nationality regulations change the previous patrilineal nationality system to a joint patrilineal - matrilineal system .
now the children of chinese women and foreign men will also be entitled to roc nationality -lrb- as the children of chinese men and foreign women always have been -rrb- , thus realizing equal treatment under the law for men and women .
new legislation governing electronic games imposes strict penalties for use of video games for gambling or harming public morals . operators can be fined up to nt$ 1 million if they knowingly allow middle - school or primary - school children to play in their shops during school hours .
amendments to the existing cultural assets preservation law will bring historical structures under protection , and will also permit the use of modern technology to repair or protect historic structures so long as the original appearance of the building remains intact .
also , in the future , whole historic settlements or streets can be considered monuments to be preserved .
finally , a law governing control and treatment of rare diseases , will allow importation of appropriate medications , treatments , and essential life - saving nutritional supplements for those suffering from tens of unusual ailments . p. 77 legislators burned the midnight oil to pass last - minute bills .
many who found the ordeal too much to take had to sneak in naps whenever possible . -lrb- photo by li chih - wei -rrb- p. 79 with an election coming up , the battles in the legislature have been especially hard - fought . -lrb- photo by wang ying - hao -rrb-
innocents abroad educating taiwanese kids in the prc -lrb- jackie chen / photos by diago chiu / tr. by david mayer -rrb-
when taiwanese business people take up an expatriate lifestyle , the thing they worry about most is family matters , especially the education of their growing children . for taiwanese expatriates in mainland china , incompatibility between the taiwanese and mainland education systems is the main reason why most of them do not move their families across with them .
in the city of dongguan , located just over 40 kilometers east of guangzhou , the ground has already been broken on a project to build the first school for taiwanese children in mainland china .
there is an especially large taiwanese expatriate community in the dongguan area , and there are high hopes that the new school , scheduled to begin officially enrolling students in september , will go a long way toward solving the nettlesome problem of education .
" sometimes i get to thinking that i 've achieved absolutely everything i set out to do in life , " says h. d. ye , " then i take a look at my family 's situation and it seems as though i have n't really done anything at all . "
as chairman of the board at dongguan primax electronics products , ye has nine factories and over 4,000 employees under him . why would someone so successful be so down about his situation ?
says ye with a worried frown , " recently my wife has been calling me a lot from canada to talk about her problems trying to maintain discipline with our kids . they 're getting out of control , and we 're afraid they might get into trouble .
they say it 's tough to try and raise children as an expatriate , and i can sure attest to that . "
i 'm doing this for you ye has worked hard for many years for the taiwanese community in dongguan , a subject he cares deeply about .
" i do n't care if it 's nothing more than a thatched - roof cottage ; i want to get a school for taiwanese children up and running . " after stepping down from his former position as chairman of the taiwan businessmen association of dongguan -lrb- tbad -rrb- , ye took over as director of the dongguan taiwanese school preparatory committee .
says ye , " i 'm even busier now than i was before . " of the more than 3,000 taiwanese business people in dongguan , less than 5 % have been joined by their families . with the extended absence of these people from taiwan , undisciplined children and lonely spouses " cause a lot of problems for families and society as a whole , " says ye .
there are a number of reasons why family members are unwilling to move to the mainland -
some spouses have jobs in taiwan , crime is a concern on the mainland , and the quality of medical care is not so good there . for people with families , however , the key stumbling block is the quality of education .
asks sylvia yang , deputy chairperson of the tbad women 's division , " what are we working to achieve , anyway ? we want a better life for our children , of course . " she adds that while the education system on the mainland is not so bad , taiwanese people have a hard time getting used to the way of life there .
" how would you feel if your child learned from his classmates to cough up phlegm all over the place ? sorry , but that 's not something you can get used to . "
grumbles one businessman , " my kids have come home singing the national anthem of the prc , and calling chiang kai - shek a thug and lee teng - hui a public enemy . now how do i handle something like that ? "
in the opinion of norman hsu , vice president of a foods company whose family of four had spent a few years in new zealand before moving to dongguan , " the first thing to do is ask the children their reason for saying such things . ask what their teachers say , and what they themselves think . then go on to give them your own views . "
while many consider hsu 's approach a very enlightened one , there is no denying that at the gut level the influence of mainland chinese culture rubs the wrong way .
comments one taiwanese businessman , " you worry that your kid is going to become a communist . "
taiwanese people in the mainland invariably wish to maintain their ties with taiwan , and are particularly anxious to ensure that their children can integrate quickly into the school system back home once they return . with the number of taiwanese in dongguan increasing in recent years , it was just a matter of time before a taiwanese school was established .
thanks to the vigorous advocacy of h. d. ye , the tbad began working seriously in 1994 to establish a school , but the difficulties were considerable .
they had to find land , funds , teachers , and much more .
with taiwanese and mainland authorities at political loggerheads , the school 's promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from taiwan , use taiwanese teaching materials , and appoint a taiwanese person to the post of principal .
they also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in taiwan . since the people in dongguan were paying taxes in taiwan and planning to run the school according to the taiwanese system , they asked whether the ministry of education might not treat the school the same as any private school in taiwan , and subsidize it accordingly . teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get the school established ; if teachers from public schools were to teach in dongguan , would they retain the seniority that they had built up in taiwan ?
" if we had n't been able to hire experienced teachers , " notes ye , " it would have seriously impaired the quality of our faculty . "
ye continually stressed to authorities in both taiwan and the mainland , " politics is for the politicians . in the meantime , our children need an education . that 's all we 're asking . " the main obstacles were finally overcome by the end of 1999 . the mainland chinese authorities have agreed to allow the use of taiwanese teaching materials and faculty .
as for the appointment of a principal , tbad vice chairman andrew yeh states , " i think the mainland authorities will handle the situation flexibly . they 'll probably let us hire who we want as long as we agree to refer to the person as a director or something like that . "
the dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to the association at an extremely low price , and the school 's cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 november .
the school will begin admitting students this coming september and start classes in october . the school will accept elementary and junior high school students at first . the decision about whether to open senior high school classes will be made later depending on demand .
where to send the kids ?
h. d. ye notes that there are now about 400 children of taiwanese expatriates in dongguan who attend school in the mainland . greater than half attend mainland china 's regular elementary and secondary schools , while the more affluent taiwanese send their children to private schools for expatriate children . chang mei - liang , chairperson of the tbad women 's division , is among the latter group .
after her elder son and daughter finished elementary school in taiwan she sent them to a boarding school in britain .
her ten - year - old child is too young for that though , so she sends him to a school in shenzhen for the children of hong kong expats .
the child only comes home once a week , and sending him to the school in shenzhen costs several hundred thousand nt dollars per year .
the hong kong elementary school and the international school are both an hour or two away from dongguan , and many of the taiwanese in dongguan want to be able to see their children every day .
this prompted a group of them to establish a private bilingual school called little oxford in february 1998 . the school admits children from kindergarten -lrb- age five -rrb- through grade five of elementary school . some of little oxford 's 200 students -lrb- such as norman hsu 's child -rrb- used to go to school in shenzhen , while others have transferred in from the mainland chinese public school system .
little oxford is very similar to the taiwanese school being promoted by the tbad . most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in taiwan 's elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from taiwan . the big difference is that classes are taught in both chinese and english because the taiwanese parents are very interested in seeing that their children learn english well .
according to huang su , executive director of little oxford , " a lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children 's education is exactly like the regular system in taiwan , but i have to remind them that once you 've left in taiwan , you 're not regular any longer . "
according to huang , making the school a mirror image of those in taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school . the key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .
in addition to taiwanese teaching materials , she has also incorporated some materials from the mainland and overseas into the curriculum .
huang su , who hails from beijing , majored in english at university and is keenly interested in education .
she came to dongguan after marrying a taiwanese expat there , and it was the taiwanese business community that asked her to run a school . little oxford now has a very good reputation in the taiwanese community .
in fact , some taiwanese send their children to little oxford from as far away as zhuhai -lrb- just opposite macau on the other side of the pearl river estuary -rrb- . huang has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that taiwanese parents show for their children 's education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from their native taiwan .
one parent , for example , practically begged her to admit his six - year old child , explaining , " he 's never had any playmates .
the only people he 's ever been with are his nanny and some employees from the plant . " the taiwanese kids at little oxford come from many different backgrounds . some speak in a mixture of chinese and english , while others speak and look just like any mainland chinese child .
many of them have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the united states , taiwan , and the mainland . there is no trace of the world 's cares on their faces though ; the thing they 're most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .
one bespectacled child laments , " school is better in canada because they do n't have to do so much homework .
there 's too much homework in taiwan and the mainland . it 's no fun . " an older brother and sister , it turns out , have both lived overseas .
huang stays in close touch with the taiwanese parents .
their children enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of the world , but the biggest problem is that " they are n't motivated and do n't understand why they should need to study . " another problem for the school is the lack of interesting things to do in dongguan . unless teachers are very devoted to education , they are not likely to stay there long .
" it 's all the more difficult , " notes huang frankly , " to hold on to teachers from taiwan , who ca n't help but compare their situation here with what they are accustomed to in taiwan . "
the taiwanese school will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged little oxford . dongguan , cradle of scholars with little oxford already in operation , why should the taiwanese expats wish to establish a separate school for their children ?
sylvia yang points out that little oxford is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in shenzhen , the tuition at little oxford still costs rmb 38,000 -lrb- nt$ 160,000 -rrb- per semester , more than many taiwanese parents can pay . says h. d. ye , " we would like to get funding from both the taiwan and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . "
although the cornerstone has already been laid , ye reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired .
although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done . expenses for the first few years are expected to reach nt$ 60 million , and only about nt$ 20 million has been raised so far . ye often speaks in taiwan on the topic of investing in the mainland , something which he knows a lot about . says ye jokingly , " i jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for the school . " the tbad is now considering funding the school through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms .
the location for the school has already been selected . it is a large site in the township of zhongtang . the lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven . the school grounds are located next to the ancient beidi temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree .
on the temple gate a fading couplet reads : " he who is truly dedicated to his endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of his surroundings a land of delight .
he who has achieved true wisdom shall make of his home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where he may be . "
the locals must have taken this message to heart over the years , because it is said that hometown scholars from zhongtang often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past .
it is very gratifying that a place like dongguan , with its abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition . it is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the taiwanese business community .
apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a " taiwanese miracle " on the cultural front as well ? p. 91 little oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely . a school bus takes students to and from school , and all visitors must announce themselves before entering . p. 92 little oxford elementary school teaches classes in both chinese and english , which is just what the taiwanese expatriates want for their children . p. 93 h. d. ye is a key player in dongguan 's taiwanese expatriate community . he has played the lead role in establishing a taiwanese school in dongguan . the community 's ability to wrap up preparations and start construction in just two years is due in large part to ye 's energy and enthusiasm .
teng hsiang - yang : self - made ethnographer -lrb- chang chiung - fang / photos by vincent chang / tr. by david mayer -rrb- if you take an interest in the aboriginal tribes of central taiwan , it wo n't be long before you run into the name of teng hsiang - yang .
it matters little what leads to this interest . you might be filming a documentary or writing a magazine or newspaper article . you might be engaged in a high - powered research project at academia sinica , or just writing a graduate thesis .
in any case , teng 's copious fieldwork is not something you can afford to ignore .
among other projects , teng 's work with the thao -lrb- also known as the shao or sao -rrb- , a tiny aboriginal tribe living in the vicinity of sun moon lake , looms particularly important in the wake of the chichi earthquake , for the temblor has dealt a heavy blow to a community that now has only 282 members left . teng has thrown himself wholeheartedly into the task of rebuilding the one village where the thao remain .
so who exactly is teng hsiang - yang ?
how did he become such an important figure in the academic community ?
teng hsiang - yang had originally been planning to catch a flight on september 23 to celebrate the mid-autumn festival together with his wife and children . little did he know , however , that his plans would be interrupted on september 21 by the biggest earthquake to hit taiwan in a century . a giant jolt in the wee hours sent teng 's apartment building listing and caused the fourth floor to collapse entirely .
on the first floor , where teng ran a medical testing laboratory , a quake - related power outage prevented him from opening the front door . he then hung a rope out a third - floor window and lowered himself to safety , injuring his hands slightly in the process .
he was n't too worried about the injuries , nor was the destruction of his laboratory a major concern . he was , however , extremely anxious to save the results of ethnological fieldwork going back nearly two decades . for teng , these materials were priceless treasures .
" luckily , " says teng , " i managed to get about 80 - 90 % of it out . " taiwan 's great melting pot
a hakka from the township of puli , teng was born in 1951 .
puli and the nearby rural townships of yuchih , kuohsing , and jen'ai comprise an area known as shuishalien , where many different ethnic groups have always lived side - by - side .
in addition to fujianese , cantonese , hakkas , and the pingpu aborigines -lrb- various plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes that have almost completely assimilated into the han chinese community -rrb- , the area is also home to many mountain - dwelling aboriginal tribes , including the atayal , sediq , bunun , thao , perugawan , pazeh , taokas , and murauts .
although teng makes his living by running a medical testing lab , a fortunate combination of circumstances has also sparked an abiding interest in ethnology .
explains teng , " i grew up listening to the old folks tell stories about the aboriginal tribes . there was talk about headhunting expeditions and wars . they used to scare us kids by saying ' the tribesmen will get you ! ' " he had frequent contact with aborigines , and many of his best friends in school were aborigines .
after graduating from the department of medical laboratory science at chungtai institute of health sciences and technology , he took up an internship at the puli christian hospital , where many of the patients were also aborigines .
in 1974 , teng opened a medical testing laboratory in puli . besides providing teng with a livelihood , the lab also brought him into contact with the aborigines , among whom he would make many friends .
tajik bawan , a member of the atayal tribe , first met teng ten years ago when he visited the lab for a blood test . teng 's reputation preceded him , for bawan had already heard about " the mugan -lrb- chinese person -rrb- in puli who knows a lot about us aborigines . "
self - trained ethnographer
living in an ethnically complex area like puli , teng has always been very aware of ethnic conflict as well as the fusion and disappearance of cultures .
in 1967 wei huei - lin , an anthropology professor at academia sinica , asked teng to take him to interview aborigines . teng picked up a lot of valuable fieldwork techniques by watching professor wei interview the old folks .
thereafter , whenever he had any spare time he would go visit the aborigines and chat with the old folks .
teng 's interest in the wushe incident of 1930 -lrb- in which members of several aboriginal tribes killed over 100 japanese people in the village of wushe and later met with grave retribution from the colonial authorities -rrb- was piqued when his father gave him two documents on the subject . " after i started taking an active interest in the wushe incident in 1981 , people warned me to be careful . "
many scholars used to steer clear of taiwan 's colonial history , but teng happened to take an interest in the subject just as taiwanese society was beginning to become more liberal .
the fact that teng was not a member of the academic community was also fortunate , for it freed him of the pressures that academics must deal with . says teng , " this was about the story of my hometown . i felt that this research simply had to be done . " although an amateur in the field of ethnography , teng is highly regarded in academic circles for his work in recording the oral history of taiwan 's aborigines .
his good friend wang hao , who teaches in junior high school , jokingly calls teng " the puli center for ethnographic fieldwork . " " when i first started doing my fieldwork there were still about 20 survivors of the wushe incident , but they 've all passed away now . " according to teng , most of the ones lucky enough to survive were extremely reluctant to talk about it , and it took a long time for him to win their trust , but he did succeed eventually .
" i had a couple of factors working in my favor .
number one , i was n't a government official , and number two , i work in the field of medicine , so they were n't quite so wary of me . "
after starting off with such subjects as religious beliefs and tribal customs , the old folks slowly got to the point where they were willing to break their silence on more sensitive issues .
teng does his homework in the field of anthropology , there has been a growing trend in recent years to rely on the results of field studies to check the veracity of historical records . teng hsiang - yang enjoys close relations with the aborigines , which is why researchers and graduate students interested in studying the austronesian tribes of central taiwan always come to puli to seek teng 's help . teng is a frequent participant in research projects focusing on the aboriginal tribes .
for example , in an academia sinica study that ran from 1992 to 1996 and focused on the cultural and kinship ties between taiwan 's nine main aboriginal tribes , teng helped to study the thao and the pazeh -lrb- a plains - dwelling tribe -rrb- .
according to hsu mu - chu , a researcher at academia sinica 's institute of ethnology , " teng hsiang - yang 's status as a member of the medical community and his wide contacts among the aborigines enabled him to make a key contribution to the research project . "
if it had n't been for teng 's detailed knowledge of the kinship ties in some clans , the researchers would never have been able in some cases to identify pure tribal lineages for study . says teng , " the scholars at the institute of ethnology have always given me a lot of support . "
having received so much help , teng has practically felt an obligation to make it count . as a medical technician without formal training in ethnology , teng 's qualifications for doing fieldwork have been questioned by some , but his work is highly regarded among the specialists at the institute of ethnology and the institute of linguistics , preparatory office , two academia sinica bodies with which teng has worked closely .
according to hsu mu - chu , " he is very hard working , and his fieldwork methods come very close to what we ask of academic researchers . " hsu points out that teng 's study of the thao is especially valuable because no one else has done any fieldwork on this tribe since 1958 . teng spent six years recording their religious festivals , marriage customs , property ownership system , land development , etc . in so doing , he has done much to make up for 40 years of neglect .
according to hsu , the theoretical framework used by anthropologists must be supported by the results of fieldwork , and teng has done a very thorough job of providing excellent first - hand materials . close observation over an extended period of time by local citizens can make up for the shortcomings of academic research .
teng is in a better position than a professional researcher to engage in long - term observation of the month - long harvest festival of the thao , for example , because he lives in the local area .
thus it is that he has been able to record the thao tribe 's religious festivals over a long period . this has been very helpful for researchers . hsu mu - chu is now writing a book on the history of the thao , and is relying heavily on teng 's work . honorary sediq
in hsu 's opinion , it is teng 's deep concern for his fellow human beings that has enabled him to devote so much of himself for such a long time to his fieldwork .
" it is n't every anthropologist , " says hsu , " who shows this quality . " this concern for his fellow human beings has earned teng many friends among the aborigines . one such friend is a man named takken -lrb- chinese name : teng chien - tang -rrb- , the great - grandson of a tribal chieftain .
his grandfather and grandmother were survivors of the wushe incident , but they had always been unwilling to talk about the past .
says takken , " i had never even heard of the wushe incident when i was a kid . it was only after i entered the university that people gradually started talking about it . " he points out that it is very unusual for someone , purely out of personal interest and concern , to visit old folks in so many tribes and do a systematic study of their history . " our ancestors owe him a great debt . "
says the teacher tajis bawan , " before i met teng hsiang - yang , i did n't have a very clear image of who we were as a people , and i had only heard unsubstantiated rumors and snippets about the wushe incident . " later , however , he was invited to accompany teng on his trips to interview old folks in the mountains . these forays were very moving experiences for bawan . " here this man is not even a member of our tribe , yet he has been spending so much time and effort on our behalf .
how can we be content to know nothing about ourselves ? " with teng 's encouragement , bawan started interviewing old folks on his own and recording his tribe 's eating habits , manner of dress , housing , geographic distribution , arts , folk legends , daily life , and other traditions .
at the same time , there are some atayal people who view teng with suspicion , saying , " he 's just another plains dweller trying to make money . "
others have said , " he 's out to become famous . "
bawan , too , had once harbored such suspicions , but since getting involved in fieldwork himself , he has discovered how quickly the expenses add up for transportation , development of slides , and so much more . not only is it not a money - making proposition , it 's actually a drain on one 's personal finances .
as for fame , bawan asks , " so what if he has become famous ? it did n't happen overnight . during the nearly 20 years that he 's devoted himself to his fieldwork , making a name for himself has been the last thing on his mind . "
to thank him for his contributions to their tribe , teng 's atayal friends call him " hiro , " which means " sun " in sediq . bawan simply considers him a member of the atayal tribe .
" if we are the atayal nation , then he is an honorary member of the sediq . "
-lrb- the sediq are one branch of the atayal tribe . -rrb- the thao have also conferred similar status upon teng , whom they call " ita thao " -lrb- " one of us thao " -rrb- . kudos and criticism
teng hsiang - yang has written a number of articles based on his years of fieldwork , including : " tracing the origins of written language among the plains - dwelling aborigines of puli , " " why the languages of the plains - dwelling aborigines of the puli basin have disappeared , " " the effect upon the thao tribe of han chinese settlement of the shuishalien area . "
he has also written several books , including : " the wushe incident , " " thick fog , dark clouds , " and " the face of the thao . "
the wushe incident , which was selected as one of the ten best books of the year , provides a comprehensive history of the wushe incident and includes many valuable historical photos . with a keen sense of pathos , teng writes , " misunderstandings and hatred born of cultural differences and ethnic divisions were the main culprits behind the wushe incident . "
in 1993 teng won the 16th china times prize for nonfiction for thick fog , dark clouds - aftermath of the wushe incident for an atayal family .
thick fog , dark clouds focuses on the life of yawai taimo , daughter of an atayal chieftain .
in connection with the plan of the japanese colonial authorities to pacify the " barbarians , " yawai was married off in 1912 to sazuka narusuke , the top - ranking police official in wushe . unfortunately for yawai , the wushe incident of 1930 put people from mixed marriages like hers in a complex predicament . amidst the burning ethnic tensions of the time , developing a sense of personal identity was especially difficult for the children , who hardly knew whether to consider themselves japanese , taiwanese , atayal , or chinese . thick fog , dark clouds is the story of innocent , helpless victims of taiwan 's turbulent history .
li jen - kuei , director of academia sinica 's institute of linguistics , preparatory office , wrote as follows in the book 's preface : " much has been written about the wushe incident , but teng hsiang - yang is the only one to do it with such depth and feeling . "
teng , however , feels rather uncomfortable about winning a prize for nonfiction with his very first book . " it 's not that my writing was all that good . the story itself is just very compelling . " after more than ten years of field research , teng wrote the book -lrb- over 100 pages long -rrb- in just five evenings and then let his friends read the manuscript . one of his friends , the highly successful nonfiction writer liao chia - chan , had only gotten five minutes into the book before exclaiming , " this is going to win literary prizes ! "
little did he know that his words would prove prophetic . says liao , " a professional writer could never go that long without writing anything , but teng hsiang - yang does n't make his living as a writer , and that enabled him to let the book gradually take shape over a long period of time . "
right after winning the literary prize , however , teng was hit with a lawsuit by the grandson of shimoyama hiroshi and sazuka toyoko , two of the people that teng wrote about in the book .
the suit charges teng with seven counts of libel .
puli 's " ambassador to new zealand "
the lawsuit was just part of a string of misfortunes for teng . a nephew taking part in fieldwork fell into sun moon lake and drowned . teng 's older sister , who had cared for him when he was growing up , died from cancer .
deeply dispirited , teng put his fieldwork aside and moved to new zealand with his family in 1995 .
the move was greeted with criticism : " all that talk about his love for puli was just a put - on . " teng , however , responded , " we are moving to new zealand mainly for our children 's education .
i myself am not leaving puli . in fact , i 'll be bringing the best of new zealand back here with me . " in his view , there is much that we could learn from new zealand , including its emphasis on lifelong learning , and its sorted waste collection .
his good friend wang hao jokingly calls teng " puli 's ambassador to new zealand . "
on one visit back home , people who had once collaborated in his fieldwork asked him to help formulate a community development project for puli , and a group that had taken part in his study of the thao tribe asked him to get back into fieldwork .
and so it was that the gravity of hometown , friends , and the land pulled teng back to puli again .
leaving his wife and children in new zealand , he returned to puli to resume his unfinished work . " i tried to write in new zealand , but i do n't know whether it was the easy life or the distance . i just could n't do it . "
since returning , however , he still has n't been able to concentrate on his writing .
" i 'm too involved in local affairs . there are more errands and busywork than i have time for . " according to wang hao , personal relationships in a small town like puli are very close , and anyone with an outspoken personality ends up getting forced into all sorts of civic responsibilities . teng happens to be one of the more outspoken types in puli . teng is the first person that many people meet when visiting puli . not long after li chia - tung became president of national chi - nan university he made it a point to visit teng hsiang - yang and liao chia - chan to discuss ways to strengthen relations between the university and the local community .
teng is thus very well known in puli , and extremely active in community affairs . the list of projects in which he has been involved is long :
a comprehensive community development project ; an effort to preserve the tamalin archeological site ; the writing of the section on aboriginal culture in a textbook on native culture in nantou ; the puli music and arts festival ; an effort to persuade academia sinica to establish a campus in puli ; etc . passing the torch teng had originally set himself a goal of getting his tenth book written and published last year . with a lot of material on hand , and with a lot of the book already written , all he needed to do was add the finishing touches .
part of the book focuses on the story of inoue hajime , a japanese doctor whose life teng has been studying for the past ten years .
says teng , " after inoue 's father met his death in taiwan at the hands of aborigines on a head hunting expedition , inoue swore to ' avenge ' his father 's death with kindness . he ended up living 38 years among the aborigines , not even returning to japan when his mother passed away .
he finally left taiwan in 1947 .
when i went to japan last january and paid my respects at his grave , i discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in atayal . i used to cry every time i talked about this wonderful doctor , but i 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by .
i have to hurry up and get the book written . " teng had been planning to pass the torch to others , both in community affairs and in his efforts to collect the oral histories of the aborigines .
" i 've done my bit , " said teng , " and soon it will be time to let the aborigines speak for themselves . " then the earthquake threw a wrench in teng 's plans . after his medical laboratory was destroyed , teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local community . he has kept himself busy preparing posters , organizing a community newspaper , and establishing the " new puli community development foundation . "
says teng , " puli wo n't let me go ! " the effort to rebuild the community takes precedence over everything else , so it looks like teng 's writing plans will have to be postponed . one thing , however , remains certain - teng 's love for puli and the aborigines will never fade . p. 96
the wushe incident was a taboo subject for many years in the academic community , but teng hsiang - yang 's interest was piqued when his father gave him two documents related to the incident . p. 96
teng hsiang - yang , who grew up in puli at the foot of mt. niumien , has become a walking repository of information on the atayal and thao tribes as well as the han - assimilated descendants of various former plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes . anyone interested in doing ethnography in this area is sure to seek teng 's advice .

walking the safe and narrow new strategic thinking for the defense of taiwan -lrb- eric lin / photos by diago chiu / tr. by phil newell -rrb-
the last of this generation of domestically produced ching - kuo fighter planes takes off for routine maneuvers . defense thinking in taiwan is changing to meet the challenges of advanced technology . as the first chinese new year of the new millenium approaches , changes are underway which are drawing attention to the long - term prospects for military and defense affairs in taiwan . the legislative yuan has finally passed the long - discussed national defense law and coastal defense law . these establish new regulations governing issues which have long been a focus of public concern , including unification of the military chain of command , alteration of the weapons procurement process , establishment of a flexible military service system , and transfer of defense responsibilities for remote offshore islands .
in addition , as the presidential election battle heats up , cross-strait security issues - especially those related to missiles and missile defense - have again come up in taiwan , with candidates rushing to put forward their own strategic thinking .
faced with the turbulent cross-strait situation , can taiwan 's military ensure security ?
how should taiwan respond to mainland china 's active development of a missile attack capability ?
will pro-active construction of a missile defense system raise tensions between the two sides ?
how can taiwan defend itself without provoking an irrational response from mainland china ? two national defense topics have been especially hot in this new year .
one is that defense of the remote pratas and spratley islands will be transferred to the coast guard command . the second is the subject of missile defense . both kuomintang presidential candidate lien chan and democratic progressive party presidential candidate chen shui - bian have commented on the subject . last december , at a seminar at the armed forces university entitled " transmillennial national security and military strategy , " lien delivered an address entitled " national defense strategy and construction in the new century . "
he suggested that taiwan will have to develop long - range missiles to counter the mainland chinese military threat . while " effective deterrence " would remain the cornerstone of strategy , it should no longer be passive , said lien , but " pro-active . "
the new generation of military capability will be based , he said , on the principle of " offensive defense . " the best defense is .... chen raised a similar idea . in his " defense policy white paper , " he proposed developing medium - and short - range surface - to - surface missiles .
obviously , after the experience of the 1996 taiwan strait missile crisis , people in taiwan have considered defending the island against mainland chinese missile attack to be one of the foremost defense problems .
interestingly , even as such " pro-active defense " ideas are being proposed , the ministry of national defense -lrb- mnd -rrb- has made a seemingly contrary move : it has announced that military forces will be withdrawn from the remote offshore pratas and spratley islands , and that responsibility for these islands and for coastal patrolling will be transferred to the coast guard . the mnd argues that since the military is being streamlined , in order to concentrate defense forces in taiwan , penghu , kinmen , and matsu , the defense of the pratas and spratley islands - which are in the south china sea - and the protection of coastal fishing vessels and coastal security should be left to the coast guard .
withdrawing from the two islands groups while moving actively to build a missile system may look like contradictory moves , but in fact they 're both part of the military blueprint for the future - the abandonment of initial use of military force , but the ability to retaliate when attacked . the military blueprint for the new century is still being drawn up . the stimulus for these new ideas has been the aggressive military deployments by mainland china aimed at taiwan .
lin cheng - yi , a research fellow at the institute of european and american affairs at the academia sinica , says that the successful testing by mainland china of missiles in 1996 has altered the lines of strategic thought on both sides of the strait .
guided missiles have replaced aircraft as the major threat to taiwan . in recent years mainland china has also constructed short - range surface - to - surface missile bases along its southeast coast which are specifically targeted at taiwan . according to a report in the december 22 , 1999 washington post , in november us reconnaissance satellites discovered that the prc had begun constructing a new air defense missile base in the zhangzhou region along the southeast coast .
lin cheng - yi says that , besides rapidly building missile bases , the prc has repeatedly stated that " there should be a timetable for resolution of the taiwan problem . " the prc 's extremely assertive deployment of armed capability opposite taiwan is deeply felt in the roc . if taiwan does not respond in time , it will be forced into an increasingly passive position .
lt. gen. fuh wei - ku , commandant of the air command and general staff college at the armed forces university , notes that for the moment taiwan still has a slight edge in terms of air defense . however , it is widely estimated that by 2005 , there will be a shift in the military capabilities of the two sides . although this prediction is not necessarily accurate , taiwan should work to maintain its edge so as to guarantee peace through strength .
fuh wei - ku offers the following analysis : currently the prc weapons which pose the greatest threat to taiwan are sukhoi aircraft , m - class missiles , and cruise missiles . of these , the aircraft are already strategically of the second rank , but taiwan must be alert to the missiles . the m - class weapons can pass through the stratosphere directly into taiwan 's rear areas , while cruise missiles can undertake low - level long - range attacks .
" we can defend against the m - class missiles with our patriot missile defense system , but we currently have only limited ability to intercept cruise missiles .
the most important subject for the moment is to rethink air defense strategy , " he says .
missile difficulties
any discussion of missiles also involves many other issues , including international strategy and domestic civilian morale .
from the point of view of international strategy , the us clearly does not want taiwan to develop its own offensive missile capability .
the us responded negatively to lien chan 's proposal to build long - range missiles . at the state department 's end - of - year press conference , us under secretary of state for arms control john holum said that the us did not want to see taiwan take any action which would violate the basic norms of the 1987 missile technology control regime . thus the us would not be happy to see taiwan develop offensive long - range missile systems .
kuo cheng - liang , a professor of political science at soochow university , says that the us opposes taiwan 's development of long - range missiles because of the us 's long - range strategy vis - a - vis china . the us has always been responsible for strategic deterrence , while taiwan handles local tactical defense . if taiwan were to develop long - range missiles , this would change taiwan 's defensive posture , and alter the taiwan - us military division of labor .
there is another possibility for taiwan in defending against the threat of missiles from the prc . besides building offensive systems , taiwan could also join the us theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- plan . but this may not be feasible , says bih chung - ho , editor - in - chief of the defense magazine defense technology monthly .
he says that if taiwan were to join the tmd this would be a return to a situation of joint us - taiwan defense , such as existed during the cold war , when taiwan was on the frontline in a chain of islands surrounding china . for the prc , which is endeavoring to move from coastal defense to a blue - water capability , the provocation would be enormous . the united states has thus been deliberately unclear - it does not exclude taiwan from the tmd , but it has not clearly said that taiwan would be included .
in any case , says lin chong - pin , vice-chairman of the roc 's mainland affairs council , potential tmd buyers still do not know where the money would come from , while the tmd producer has not yet come up with a finished product . so this is still just a political debating point , and it is too early to talk about any impact on the military situation in the taiwan strait .
domestic morale thus , from the international strategic angle , it still seems most practical for taiwan to have its own missile systems . moreover , this is also necessary from the point of view of public opinion .
in an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in taiwan , roc minister of defense tang fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact . but in taiwan , where resources are concentrated , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -lrb- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -rrb- , and to factories . more importantly , he says , the citizens of taiwan are not psychologically prepared . there has been no war for decades now , and there are even very few usable civil defense shelters .
if the prc were to launch 200 - 300 guided missiles against taiwan , although the damage to industry , power , and communications would probably not be as serious as was caused by the september 21 earthquake , citizens are not psychologically prepared for war , and the economy might not be able to withstand the assault .
chung chien , an expert on military affairs , says that the turbulence created in the public mind by the 1996 prc missile tests has not abated even today . the construction of an effective missile defense system is the main military problem in bringing peace of mind to taiwan citizens . thus , in the presidential elections , although missile defense can not be said to be " the beef " of campaigning , it is still an important " side dish " that many citizens are concerned about .
beyond missiles
if taiwan can not develop long - range missiles or participate in the tmd plan , what effective strategic options are left ?
fuh wei - ku points out that taiwan 's domestically produced sky bow and sky sword missiles have defensive capability . but pure defense is not enough . even if missile defense could be 99 % effective , and only one percent of attacking missiles got through , the situation could still be a total loss . thus , it would be more effective to build an offensive missile system to deter the enemy . taiwan 's domestically produced hsiung feng missiles have over - the - horizon attack capability , and could remain the main focus of future research and development . bih chung - ho adds that it should be no problem , using the resources of the chungshan institute of technology , to manufacture short - range surface - to - surface missiles -lrb- ssms -rrb- without relying on purchases from overseas .
previous missile programs , including the ching feng and tien ma , all envisioned similar short - range ssms -lrb- with a range of 500 or so kilometers -rrb- . lin cheng - yi says that it is indeed feasible for taiwan 's military to develop an effective retaliatory capability ; development could focus on short - range ssms and an air - to - surface attack capability , which could expand the battlefield beyond taiwan . lin points to other countries that have a doctrine of extending the battlefield outside national territory .
for example , south korea has developed its own ssms , singapore has airborne refueling capability , and israel has a strategy of keeping the fighting outside its borders as much as possible . of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . prc military affairs expert alex kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way . defense alternatives although constructing a missile system is a main focus of defense thinking in taiwan , effective use of high - tech weaponry depends on the quality of military personnel and , moreover , can not be seen as a panacea for all defense problems .
the problem of personnel quality has in fact been a focus of serious concern in recent years . for example , over the last two years the air force has lost six fighter planes in accidents , revealing a serious weakness in managing high - tech weapons . fuh wei - ku says that the problem is not one of integrating the different types of weaponry bought from the " mini-united nations " of sources from which taiwan has acquired high - tech arms , because the military accounted for this problem already . rather , the main problem is in the nation 's military service system , which makes it difficult to retain soldiers long enough to cultivate expertise . most of the problems with high - tech weapons have in fact been human error . at the ceremony marking the commissioning of the fifth f - 16 squadron held last december in hualien , there were " more planes than pilots . "
this newly established 26th fighter squadron has 18 fighter aircraft , but less than 10 pilots . according to the air force , this problem is the result of the transition period to a new generation of aircraft . for pilots to qualify for the new aircraft , they must have at least 400 hours of flying experience . but taiwan 's pilots get limited time in the air , so there are n't enough qualified pilots .
experts explain that taiwan has limited airspace , and virtually no space for training .
moreover , it seems , virtually all of the first group of pilots who went abroad to receive training for new fighter aircraft have left the military to fly for civilian airlines , so the problem of talent outflows is severe .
the same applies to other types of high - tech material . defense alternatives although constructing a missile system is a main focus of defense thinking in taiwan , effective use of high - tech weaponry depends on the quality of military personnel and , moreover , can not be seen as a panacea for all defense problems .
the problem of personnel quality has in fact been a focus of serious concern in recent years . for example , over the last two years the air force has lost six fighter planes in accidents , revealing a serious weakness in managing high - tech weapons . fuh wei - ku says that the problem is not one of integrating the different types of weaponry bought from the " mini-united nations " of sources from which taiwan has acquired high - tech arms , because the military accounted for this problem already . rather , the main problem is in the nation 's military service system , which makes it difficult to retain soldiers long enough to cultivate expertise .
most of the problems with high - tech weapons have in fact been human error . at the ceremony marking the commissioning of the fifth f - 16 squadron held last december in hualien , there were " more planes than pilots . " this newly established 26th fighter squadron has 18 fighter aircraft , but less than 10 pilots .
according to the air force , this problem is the result of the transition period to a new generation of aircraft . for pilots to qualify for the new aircraft , they must have at least 400 hours of flying experience . but taiwan 's pilots get limited time in the air , so there are n't enough qualified pilots . experts explain that taiwan has limited airspace , and virtually no space for training .
moreover , it seems , virtually all of the first group of pilots who went abroad to receive training for new fighter aircraft have left the military to fly for civilian airlines , so the problem of talent outflows is severe .
the same applies to other types of high - tech material .
doctrine , not weapons it is bad enough that high - tech weapons may be rendered irrelevant by the inability to utilize them properly .
another problem is that they might be bypassed altogether by a different enemy strategy . alex kao warns that currently both public commentators and the military 's own research focus on the possibility that the first wave of warfare in the taiwan strait will be a missile attack . this ignores the evolution of land - sea - air joint operations in modern warfare . mainland china need not choose to use high - cost , limited - quantity guided missiles , but could instead use a large number of 360 - km range rockets to first attack taiwan 's air fields from the chinese coast , thereby paralyzing taiwan 's air superiority .
then , their navy could ferry raiders to taiwan in less than one hour . kao recalls that vietnamese land forces were used to infiltrate us air fields in vietnam and neutralize american air superiority .
particularly now that the coastal defense law has been passed , and responsibility for coastal patrols will pass to the non-military coast guard command , if taiwan 's military still operates under the traditional assumption of first establishing air and sea superiority followed by defense on land , this could give mainland china an opportunity to strike a death blow . " although this is merely a hypothesis , it points to a blind spot : the first strike will not necessarily be missiles .
a solid national defense requires that no possibility be overlooked , " he concludes .
third wave warfare even as discussion on missile systems continues , an unprecedented form of threat - third - wave warfare - is lurking .
lin chong - pin says that currently both sides are engaged in third - wave - warfare development . this type of warfare is divided into " hard kill " and " soft kill . " hard kill refers to the deployment on missile warheads of weapons with directional capability - using , for example , lasers , microwaves , electromagnetic pulse , and particle beams - which could increase the destructiveness of missiles .
" soft kill " refers to computer viruses and electronic interference to destroy the enemy 's computer systems , and thereby to neutralize the enemy 's military capability in a bloodless manner .
some people see in third - wave warfare an opportunity to seize a decisive advantage in the face of a future armed threat from mainland china . to be sure , because of the domestic development of the electronics industry in taiwan , the roc has a certain advantage . the military is currently actively studying the construction of information war capability , and it hopes to cooperate with the private sector and utilize private - sector computer knowledge to jointly deploy an electronics defense network . this is a key area of development for the future in which taiwan can rely on itself and need not be limited by what can be procured abroad .
construction of a complete defense system is essential , but the highest form of military strategy is still to defeat the enemy without firing a shot . in fact , the pro-active defense taiwan is currently studying is a way of pursuing peace . taiwan will not provoke mainland china , nor be the first to resort to war . but nor can it allow the prc to think that taiwan is so weak that the prc will be tempted to act rashly .
pro-active defense is necessary for taiwan , but the real goal of the taiwan side is peace . perhaps militarily there 's a standoff situation of mutual intimidation , but what taiwan most hopes for is that the cross-strait problem can be peacefully resolved without deploying a single soldier .
a date with destiny -- presidential candidates woo the voters four years ago , amidst the tense atmosphere of the first - ever direct elections for the nation 's leader in chinese history , issues of ethnicity and ideology became focal points .
the crisis sparked by prc missile tests pushed the security of taiwan to the top of the issue list , and the ticket of lee teng - hui and lien chan of the ruling kuomintang , which promised stability , won the election with 54 % of the vote . in this year 's presidential election , cross-strait policy is still an important subject .
but none of the five candidates is advocating taiwan independence , and , among the three main contenders , there is a race for the center . all three have proposed ideas to maintain peace and stability in the taiwan strait :
lien chan has proposed a " taiwan strait zone of peace , " james soong has advocated the signing of a peace treaty with the mainland , and chen shui - bian has announced that if elected he will not declare taiwan independent nor seek to have the " two states formula " inserted in the constitution .
in 1996 , president lee teng - hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided . this year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite : the three main candidates are running neck - and - neck , and the election battle is fierce . it is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .
with all the candidates having largely similar views on cross-strait relations , what issues will be decisive ?
candidates can play the stability card , the bull - market card , the serve - the - people card , the personal charisma card , and so on , but which one of these will prove to be the trump card ?
taking advantage of the chinese new year , many taiwan businessmen working in the prc returned to taiwan to spend the holiday with their families .
just after the new year , the mainland affairs council and several non-governmental groups co-sponsored a seminar on economic relations with mainland china . they invited a number of taiwan businessmen who were among the earliest to invest in the prc to come to the seminar and relate their experiences .
at this event , there was virtually no mention of the election .
the participants were far more concerned about choosing investment sites , hiring mainland personnel , and understanding customs regulations .
you could privately ask them : is there likely to be any change in the cross-strait situation after the election of a new leader ?
will the election affect willingness to invest in the prc ?
but you would only get responses like : " let 's not talk politics , " or " everyone is seeking stability , and there wo n't be much of a change . "
most of the businessmen expressed optimism that after the entry of the prc and taiwan into the world trade organization later this year , relations between the two sides would steadily improve .
a terrifying topic ?
maintaining peaceful relations across the taiwan strait is the common hope of the vast majority of the people of taiwan . when you talk about 21st century leadership in taiwan , cross-strait policy is the most serious subject that politicians must face , because it involves the very survival of taiwan .
" however , because this subject touches on the question of the ' loyalty ' of the candidates toward taiwan , it has become a terrifying topic for them , " says wang chien - chuang , president of the journalist magazine and a longtime observer of political development in taiwan . by looking at the carefully worded statements of the various candidates , he says , it is clear that they are all afraid of being accused of " selling out taiwan . " the only exception is the fringe candidate li ao , who is well - known for shooting from the hip .
unafraid of criticism that he is " betraying taiwan , " he has publicly endorsed the prc 's policy of " one country , two systems . " the other minor candidate , hsu hsin - liang , set the foundations for his mainland policy as early as ten years ago when he wrote a book on his theory of a " newly rising people . " but neither of these views conform to mainstream values , and these candidates are getting little support . what about the three main candidates ?
chen shui - bian of the democratic progressive party , which advocates taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on china policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . but , in an unguarded moment , chen also declared " long live taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real chen .
independent candidate james soong has suggested defining taiwan - prc links as a " quasi-international relationship . " this aims for a middle ground between the kmt 's " two states formula " and the prc 's " one country , two systems " that will appeal to taiwan , mainland china , and the international community .
but this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing taiwan to the status of a " quasi-country , " thereby weakening taiwan 's status and bargaining power vis - a - vis the mainland .
lien chan , candidate of the ruling kmt , is somewhat bound to support the government 's " two states formula . " after much consideration , his mainland policy has been framed as working toward the middle stage of the national reunification guidelines - in other words , attempting to re-establish official channels of communication between the two sides of the strait . " no one dares be different from the others on mainland policy , " says wang chien - chuang . this is because over the past few years a consensus has taken shape in taiwan society on policy toward mainland china : " taiwan first . "
no one has the ability to alter this consensus . the candidates can merely haggle over details of policy , such as differences over the scope or timing of liberalization of the " three direct links " -lrb- direct trade , direct transport , and direct mail -rrb- .
alexander lu , a professor of political science at national taiwan university , agrees with the no - major - innovations approach of the three candidates .
as he sees it , since currently there are three candidates with a roughly equal share of the vote , whoever wins will probably not get more than 50 % . as a result , there will be a great deal of countervailing pressure against radical change . concludes lu : " policy will tend to be centrist , and any steps taken will be small . " he adds , " taiwan is a pluralistic society , and if you want to attract many types of voters , you ca n't be too outspoken about policy .
this is because extreme clarity does n't make much difference to those who already support you , but it could cost you undecided votes . " local issues , national results
mainland policy is a minefield , but it is the foundation for all other policies , and no candidate can ignore it .
however , this does not mean , say wang and lu , that it will be a decisive factor in the election .
" there is a very curious aspect to taiwan 's electoral culture , " explains wang . taiwan is small , and voters do not clearly distinguish between the roles of the head of state , elected legislators , and government bureaucrats .
no matter how high the office , for many voters , especially in traditional constituencies , " all politics is local . "
for them , what matters is whether a politician seems concerned about their hometown issues .
that is why when chen shui - bian went to sanhsia in taipei county , he talked about a pension for the elderly , and when lien chan went to kaohsiung he talked about establishing a science - based industrial park there .
these parochial issues are the real keys to the election . next in importance is the candidate 's character , including charisma , leadership style , and attitude in dealing with incidents that come up during the campaign .
in this campaign , james soong has been at the center of much controversy over the character issue . the issues that surround him can be traced back to his more than two decades near the top in taiwan political life .
kuo shu - min of the china times express , a longtime observer of the kmt , says that controversy over james soong goes back to the days when the kmt ruled over taiwan and repressed all opposition .
when soong was kmt secretary - general , he was powerful and aloof ; the only way to get an interview with him was to block his car as it left party headquarters .
during the struggle in the kmt between the mainstream and the non-mainstream factions , soong played a vital role in consolidating the position of president lee teng - hui . in clearing out many obstacles on behalf of lee , he incurred the wrath of many party elders , who considered him to be lee 's " running dog . " soong is especially good at timing . he knows what to say and when , in order to attract the most attention . kuo recalls several such opportune moments when soong was provincial governor .
for example , he criticized the kmt center over the symbolic status assigned to the provincial governor at cabinet meetings , and also over unfairness in the division of government revenues .
his media skills were such that " he only had to open his mouth and he would be the headline on page one or two . " although opinions are divided about soong , kuo affirms one thing : he has had to be very determined in order to transform his image from that of a skilled party infighter from a high - ranking family to that of a populist who understands the people .
says kuo , " if lee teng - hui is a taiwanese opera performer , then james soong is a peking opera actor - soong 's moves are refined down to the last detail . "
for example , when the kmt was trying to persuade elder national assembly members to retire , soong met with them all individually . during his five years as governor , he visited each of the 309 towns and rural townships in taiwan . in this presidential election , at any event with a crowd , he wants to shake the hand of everyone there ; he believes that he can tell from the handshake alone whether he has that person 's vote .
gold cup and plain water
in contrast to soong and chen shui - bian , who have been through previous election battles and have distinct public identities , " lien chan is n't really a man of the people . he does n't like to have the spotlight on him , he does n't think of himself as a star , and he does n't want to put on a show . "
but , says wang chien - chuang , it is debatable whether a politician really needs to have the common touch . compare taiwan to the us . lee teng - hui is similar to bill clinton , who has a personal charisma that moves people .
lien chan , on the other hand , is more like al gore , and has always been somewhat aloof from average citizens . says wang chien - chuang , " lien chan is like plain water in a gold cup . " he 's been in government for more than 20 years , serving as minister of transportation and communications , foreign minister , taiwan provincial governor , premier , and vice president .
" yet still most citizens do not have a very strong impression of him . this is really a strange situation . " chen feng - hsin , a reporter for the united daily news , writes in the authorized biography 100 % lien chan that a large part of the reason lien appears to be unapproachable is because of the way he has come across on tv .
lien himself says that , after more than 20 years in appointive positions , he has developed a stern mien .
moreover , his appearances on television have often been at confrontational interpellation sessions in front of the legislature or the provincial assembly , so that his warmer side does not come across .
a little story in the book relates something of his sense of humor .
lien was born in xi'an in mainland china , and his first primary school was called the zuo xiu school . because of the war , he transferred out after only one year . the name of the school actually was an abbreviation for a term meaning " to educate and cultivate . " but in contemporary taiwan , coincidentally , the characters zuo xiu mean " to put on a show " or " market yourself . "
lien often jests , " it 's because i never graduated from ' make a show ' primary school that i 'm in the spot i 'm in today . "
political writer hsia chen says that when lien was foreign minister , he laid the foundations of pragmatic diplomacy , and allowed kuo wan - jung to attend the asian development bank annual conference in beijing .
after lee teng - hui came to power , lee went through a series of battles with successive premiers : lien is the only one who has had a harmonious working relationship with the president .
hsia says that lien 's political character tends to be easy - going and generous , he can comfortably delegate authority , and he is calm under pressure . local boy makes good
compared to lien chan , who comes from a wealthy family , chen shui - bian , who is an entirely self - made man , makes a marked contrast .
after starting his career as a lawyer , chen acted as defense counsel for arrested opposition leaders , and then served several terms as a legislator , making a name for himself as a standout leader of the opposition . he won the mayorship of the capital city of taipei back in 1994 , and , step by step , has become the most popular figure in the dpp .
as a legislator , chen was a sharp questioner of government officials , but he had a little trouble adjusting to being an executive official himself .
as taipei mayor , his decisiveness won many plaudits , but his manner was often perceived as overbearing and this led to frozen relations with the city council .
" chen fulfilled most of the promises he made in his campaign , but he did n't give much attention to procedural concerns , " says wang chien - chuang . for example , he adopted a curfew for young people virtually unilaterally .
as wang puts it : " perhaps chen would say that many problems in taipei had reached a point calling for decisive action , but whether efficiency is more important than consultation is an eternally debatable question . "
a group of 33 education reform advocacy organizations rated the five candidates on their views on education reform . on the question , " does the candidate have a grasp of the key problems in education reform in taiwan ? " chen and hsu hsin - liang were given top marks .
" chen dares to talk about the cost of reform , " says ting chih - jen , director of one of these education reform groups . everybody knows the education system must be reformed , but reform costs money .
" chen shui - bian dares to talk about the problem of paying the bill . "
however , though chen says he will ask the legislature to guarantee the necessary financing , he does not , as hsu hsin - liang does , guarantee that he will spend 6 % of gdp on education .
" he 's not clear enough , " says ting , who opines that chen thinks that he can wait until he 's elected before he decides how much money to spend .
overall , " chen is good at finding the weaknesses in others ' policies , but not as good at facing up to questions when he is in power .
it may be easy to become the emperor , but to win the people 's hearts requires concrete action . " pork barrel politics as for james soong , " his policies are more for helping the weak , and give more thought to the poor . " soong has taken into account the long - existing disparity between state - funded and private secondary schools in taiwan -lrb- private schools are much more expensive , though they merely provide the same education as the state schools -rrb- .
his platform includes subsidies to assist the children of low - income families who attend private secondary schools . ting admits that in evaluating education platforms , the incumbent , lien chan , is at a relative disadvantage , because the policies currently being implemented are open to immediate scrutiny .
according to ting , " lien chan has been at odds with the education community for a long time . " reformers are most disappointed that the education budget has been seriously squeezed these past few years , falling by as much as nt$ 40 billion in a single year .
" lien is also the candidate who is most likely to believe that problems can be solved by throwing money at them , " says ting . lien has stated that he wants to extend compulsory education from 9 to 12 years , and to offer vouchers for pre-school and private secondary education . these would all place tremendous strain on the already overstretched education budget .
the government debt is currently nt$ 2.6 trillion , ten times higher than a decade ago ; if these promised education " checks " were actually cashed , the debt would pass nt$ 3 trillion .
ting concludes : " he has lost his direction in terms of education policy , and he underestimates the education community . he thinks he just has to promise to throw money around and then he 'll have people persuaded . " educators are not looking to be a burden on the country ; all they want is that the government stop squeezing the existing budget smaller and smaller .
in fact , the " checks " candidates write are closely connected to their assumptions about the roles governments should play .
" just as wool grows on a sheep , if the government role expands , it will require ever greater resources , " says wu hui - lin , a researcher at the chung hua institution for economic research . as an economist , wu advocates the free market and thinks that the government 's effectiveness should not be overrated . for example , large - scale government encouragement of high - tech industry has contributed to an imbalance in the industrial structure .
the stock market is an even more obvious example : from the securities and exchange commission to the ministry of finance to the proposed stock stabilization fund , you can see the government 's shadow everywhere . " the government should go back to just playing a referee role , and do that well , " wu avers . this applies to economic relations with the prc as well , because wherever there are controls there will be speculation
this applies to economic relations with the prc as well .
laws ca n't cover everything , and always leave gray areas , so that " influential persons are positioned to undertake quasi-legal activities with impunity .
the government should not be creating special opportunities for the private profit of certain individuals . " wu believes the market should be left to itself . improvement , not change
however , others have the opposite view . some believe that taiwan 's market is too affected by non-economic factors , so the government must play a protective role . there has long been debate in taiwan over the relative importance of the market and government intervention .
but it can not be overlooked that one major reason taiwan is now the world 's 12th largest trading nation is because government policy has fostered economic prosperity . j.t. day , chairman of the national association of small and medium enterprises of the roc , avers , " taiwan needs to improve , but does not need to change . " democratic reform in taiwan in recent years has come about without the shedding of a single drop of blood ; this is an amazing accomplishment .
" our house is already built . perhaps it is not perfect , and needs some renovation , but is it really necessary to tear it down and start again ? " ten years ago , the total annual value of taiwan 's imports and exports was nt$ 50 billion .
today that figure is nt$ 200 billion , a four-fold increase .
day asks : " if taiwan were not a good business environment , why would big corporations bring their second generation back from abroad to take over ? in this era of globalization , they could simply let their children stay overseas ! " he argues that taiwan was the country least affected by the asian financial crisis because the government handled the situation well .
he gives the government 's economic cabinet a grade of 98 . he is worried that if someone other than the ruling party candidate wins the election , the new economic officials might not be as capable .
governing is different wang chien - chuang states : " all candidates have beautiful - sounding platforms , because this is a presidential election , and they must have a blueprint for governing the nation .
but running for office and running the country are two very different things . "
it has been said , " campaigning is like poetry , governing is like an essay . "
in writing a poem , one can create a coherent and highly refined work . but it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power .
scholars have stated that the 2000 election in taiwan has three special characteristics : for one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win .
and third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of taiwan 's post-strongman era . in this new era , says wang , new standards for leadership are needed . the national leader must be more than just a local politico writ large .
wang gives his personal analysis of the pros and cons for the three candidates : chen shui - bian is the person who brings the most hope and vitality , because his policies would be clearly different from those of the kmt . but his biggest problem is " instability " - not personal instability , but policy instability . for example , sometimes he seems opposed to allowing prc firms to invest in taiwan , sometimes in favor ; sometimes he seems against the opening of direct links with the mainland , sometimes not .
james soong is very capable , but his very success may be his weak point . he is often very proud of himself because his provincial administration built a bridge or aqueduct to meet the needs of ordinary people .
but , ancient chinese governing wisdom criticizes those who " accomplish a small feat and think they can do anything , or discover a trivial idea and think they are brilliant . "
lien chan offers stability above all . but he carries a heavy burden . lien must face up to the fact that his party has been governing in taiwan for 50 years , and people want change .
even if he wins , this may mean only that the people of taiwan are willing to give lien chan a chance , and would not necessarily be an endorsement of the kmt itself .
peace as a weapon
what kinds of challenges face the next leader of taiwan ?
public opinion surveys show that voters are most concerned about crime and the economy .
in a february survey conducted by the united daily news , the number of citizens very concerned about crime was 31 % , eleven percentage points higher than four years ago . roughly the same percentage said they were most concerned about problems of finance and the economy .
early this year commonwealth magazine asked citizens , " what do you think is the first thing the new president should do after taking office ? "
the results show that the people of taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " -lrb- the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -rrb- , and raising economic competitiveness .
senior journalist chu sung - chiu says that all three major candidates say they are opposed to black gold politics . but citizens want more than slogans , they want effective action . political scientist alexander lu says that the crux of the issue is resoluteness .
if the resolve was there , it would not be that difficult to reduce crime and corruption . ting chih - jen says , " crime is rising fastest among youth . "
he argues that education is in fact the best crime - fighting policy : " if students can enjoy a happy learning environment at school , then society will no longer be sitting on a powderkeg . " ting says that , although education is not a panacea , it is certainly not irrelevant .
unfortunately , the effects of education policy are visible only in the long term , and it therefore has a relatively weak position in politics and is often neglected because policymakers probably will not see the fruits of their efforts in their terms of office .
but the main industries of the 21st century , such as the information and telecommunications industries , are knowledge - based .
if education is done well , the benefits will spread to many other areas . the greatest variable for taiwan society remains the other side of the taiwan strait .
" in the past two years , taiwan has been continually testing where mainland china will draw the line in cross-strait relations , " says social critic nan fang shuo .
but playing word games over how to define the relationship is simply a way of hiding from the problem , ostrich - like , as the situation deteriorates . fortunately the three main candidates have committed themselves to a moderate path .
right now there 's a choice between peace and war in cross-strait relations .
the most important challenge for taiwan now is to transcend the old mentalities of cold war anti-communism and taiwan independence , and to build a new logic of peace . taiwan 's future is now in the hands of its voters .
party hardy ? will the election weaken political parties ? -lrb- eric lin / photos by sinorama office of photography / tr. by john murphy -rrb-
in taiwan 's " quiet revolution " of democratization , the people have participated enthusiastically , but not irrationally . now that there are two strong parties , the kmt and dpp , the slogan of " peaceful rotation of political parties in power " has become one of the most widely used appeals for the opposition . it happens to be the turn of the mil - lennium , and this has inspired many people to think of change . in the middle of march , taiwan will select the president who will lead the island into the new century . but the election , besides affecting the future direction of the country , has another rarely mentioned dimension : since the three major candidates lien chan , chen shui - bian , and james soong are running roughly equal , this suggests that after the election there may be a restructuring of taiwan 's political party system .
the people of taiwan are selecting not only their future leaders , but are choosing a new direction for party politics and democratic development .
what is it about the political environment that means that the election for the president of the roc , which was not conceived as a presidential system , will affect the future development of the country ?
how will party politics change after the election ?
is there likely to be a constitutional crisis ?
in taiwan in the year 2000 , there are many challenges : the pressure is on to achieve industrial upgrading and internationalization . also , there needs to be clear progress in the critical area of cross-strait relations . although entry into the world trade organization will create a new situation in the taiwan strait , the two sides remain in an obscure relationship that is neither war nor peace .
taiwan must come up with a comprehensive policy that considers economic , diplomatic , and military factors . internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " -lrb- the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -rrb- , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness .
it is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions . three - way battle the desire for change is reflected in the upcoming presidential election . this is the beginning of the post-strongman era .
john pomfret , bureau chief of the washington post , points out that , after a long era of rule by virtually unchallenged leaders , the electorate is looking for more choice . the 2000 race , with so many tickets contending , reflects this aspiration . at the top , this election is a contest among taiwan 's second - generation political elites .
underneath , it is a struggle among the various forces that currently exist in taiwan 's society .
the kmt nominee , lien chan , is seen as lee teng - hui 's annointed successor . he represents the continuation of kuomintang tradition . chen shui - bian , the nominee of the democratic progressive party , is the greatest hope for the opposition party as it seeks the first - ever transfer of power in taiwan .
independent candidate james soong , meanwhile , represents forces which have split away from the kuomintang . he is seen as leading a second wave of " anti-lee teng - hui " sentiment , similar to that which led to the creation of the new party several years ago .
soong 's candidacy has opened up new fault lines in taiwan 's party politics , and has attracted the support of many np legislators and other non-kmt and non-dpp forces . the new party itself , which is on the edge of collapse , has nominated the renowned author li ao as its candidate , though li is not a party member .
in addition to these four , former dpp chairman hsu hsin - liang , having failed to win the nomination of his party , withdrew from the dpp and is running as an independent .
since the campaign began in earnest , lien , chen , and soong have been getting roughly similar numbers in public opinion polls , with about a quarter of the electorate undecided .
with the election so close at hand , and the situation so uncertain , naturally the media and society have been focused on analyzing the election battle itself . very few people have transcended this to ask what impact the three - way power struggle will have on the future political situation . public opinion trial balloon the roc constitution was not originally designed as a presidential system . the constitution divided power among five branches of government , with the premier as head of the executive branch , and the president separate from , but theoretically not controlling , these five . in the past , presidents chiang kai - shek and chiang ching - kuo were the de facto unchallenged rulers of the nation , but that was because of their roles as chairmen of the kuomintang , which , under the old one - party system , outlawed any opposition . they were president because they were powerful , not powerful because they were president . but today times have changed , and so has the constitution .
most importantly , the constitutional power of the president has been greatly increased . lin wen - cheng , an associate professor in the graduate institute of mainland china studies at national sun yat - sen university , notes that the president had always enjoyed a number of special powers : appointing and dismissing of officials , dissolving of the parliament , issuing of emergency decrees in times of national emergency , and determining national - security - related policies through the national security council and the national security bureau . but recent constitutional revisions also give the president the power to appoint the premier without requiring approval from the legislative yuan . this means that the president is now the guiding figure behind all executive branch policy .
of course president lee teng - hui 's exercise of such powers has not proved politically destabilizing because he has been concurrently chairman of the kmt , which enjoys a majority in the legislative yuan . however , if the opposition wins the presidency , it is uncertain whether the president and legislature will be able to work together harmoniously . if there are conflicts , this could spark a constitutional crisis . another development that needs watching is that direct election of the president has weakened political parties . alexander lu , professor of political science at national taiwan university , states that voters no longer base their choice primarily on political party . this is what has enabled independent candidate james soong to remain a powerful force even after leaving the kmt .
whether he wins or not , his candidacy signals a drastic change in taiwan 's party politics .
candidate as hero lu continues : " direct election of the president has ' put the candidate on a pedestal , ' turning the attention of the voters to the individual . but in fact the most significant thing about this election is not which ' hero ' will lead the country . rather , voters should pay even more attention to how each of the candidates could affect future party politics and the direction of constitutional development . "
in fact , taiwan 's main parties - the kmt and the dpp as the two major parties , with the new party as a noteworthy but limited third force - all understand the implications of james soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . they know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear . kmt party chairman lee teng - hui has repeatedly called on voters to cherish the system of party politics that has been constructed in the process of democratization ; the kmt wants confirmation that people still see it as a coherent , positive political institution .
the dpp sees this election as its chance to displace the kmt and set a precedent for the peaceful rotation of political parties in power , thereby consolidating its position as the main alternative to the kmt . james soong , on the other hand , hoping to take advantage of the desire for change , emphasizes that if he is elected as a non-party candidate he will promote reforms which will alter the roles of the major parties . the new party is in the most embarrassing position , since its candidate -lrb- li ao -rrb- is not even a party member , and has been unable to keep most of its members from shifting their support to soong instead ; this election could therefore hasten the collapse of the np . peaceful transfer of power
if chen shui - bian is elected , this would be taiwan 's first case of a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another .
dpp legislator chang chun - hung says that the process of democratization in taiwan during lee teng - hui 's administration has been smooth and tranquil , but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy : the kmt 's " black gold politics . " explains chang : the dpp has never had the chance to be the ruling party , and therefore has never been in a position to fulfill its function of restraining the kmt . the result of this long - term trend is that the kmt is " overnourished " by feeding on the resources of the state and society while the opposition parties are " undernourished . "
chang says if there were a transfer of power , the opposition would be able to understand more clearly the actual difficulties of governing and to see more clearly the dark corners that need to be cleaned out . meanwhile , the ruling party , with its rich experience in governing , would be very qualified to play the role of overseeing the dpp , and a defeat for the kmt could also promote its internal reassessment and reform .
were chen shui - bian to win , though the dpp would take control of the executive branch , taiwan 's current two - major - plus - one - minor party structure would probably not change very much . chen wen - cheng says that a chen victory would have its greatest impact on the new party - and that the effect would be positive .
after an impressive start , the np has faded steadily over the past few elections , and suffered an especially sharp blow in the election for mayor of taipei two years ago .
np votes drifted to ma ying - jeou , a member of the kmt -lrb- albeit not one of lee teng - hui 's personal favorites -rrb- . the np candidate received only an anemic percentage of the ballots , bringing the party to the edge of collapse .
but if chen shui - bian becomes president , because the dpp is seen as the party of taiwan independence - the direct antithesis of the new party - this could inspire np members to pull together , and at the same time give the party the status and ability to absorb the forces that are backing james soong .
this would contribute to the building of a true three - party system . an opposition - controlled legislature
if chen shui - bian is elected , his biggest challenge will come from the legislative yuan , and the first problem will be naming a premier .
although the constitution stipulates that the president does not need the approval of the legislative yuan to name a premier , given the fact that the kmt has a majority there , chen faces the problem of finding a premier who will be able to work with kmt legislators . the chen camp is well aware of this problem . therefore they have let it be known that chen would like to ask lee yuan - tse , the universally respected nobel prize winner who is currently president of the academia sinica , to be his premier . chen , who knows that within the dpp there is little high - level governing experience , has repeatedly raised the idea of a " coalition government . "
however , it should be noted , there are after all great ideological differences between the dpp and the other parties . kmt legislator li hsien - jen points out that the dpp retains advocacy of taiwan independence in its party platform , and dpp vice-presidential candidate annette lu is well known for her support of taiwan independence . it is therefore hard to guarantee that the executive branch will not come into conflict with the legislature . in such a conflict , the premier would be caught in the crossfire . the legislature could pass a vote of no confidence and completely boycott the premier , or the premier could dissolve the parliament and appeal to a public referendum . either case would spark a constitutional crisis . alexander lu agrees that a chen victory could lead to inter-branch conflict .
but he does not see taiwan independence as the main flashpoint . the critical issues will instead be those related to " black gold politics , " such as stock trading taxes , which directly affect the interests of certain legislators . lu explains : " currently the legislative yuan is filled with representatives of capital . when it comes to laws that directly affect their personal privileges and interests , even the kmt is powerless to control them .
chen shui - bian has repeatedly emphasized that he intends to wipe out black gold politics and will never compromise . inevitably , then , there will be a clash with these legislators . " lien chan 's burden if lien chan is elected , the party - politics issues most deserving of attention will be whether this hastens the demise of the new party and whether the kmt party organization and the government can move together in step .
lien is seen as lee teng - hui 's designated successor .
but , given the term system for the chairmanship of the kmt , after the election there will be a period of time in which lee remains party chairman , while lien is president .
in the past , state policy has always been decided by the party chairman . observers are very curious about whether the kmt has in fact changed , or whether we will see a repeat of what happened back in the late 1970s :
at that time yen chia - kan was president , but national policy was in fact determined by chiang ching - kuo , whose authority derived from his post as party chairman and who took the position of premier from which to oversee day - to - day policy - making .
as li hsien - jen analyzes the situation , if lien chan is elected , there will indeed be a transition period in his relations with lee teng - hui . but this is not necessarily a bad thing for the kmt .
consider , says li , the fact that james soong 's candidacy has raised the specter of a party split .
a victory for lien , with lee continuing as party chairman , would be helpful to the kmt in resolving internal party disputes , and in consolidating lien 's party and government position . he says that it is unlikely that the yen - chiang situation would be repeated , since lee teng - hui will certainly not have an office like premier which would involve him in day - to - day policy - making . what would a lien victory mean for the new party ?
remember that the np was organized primarily out of opposition to lee teng - hui . if lien chan can escape from lee 's shadow , the new party would lose its original purpose , and members could possibly return to the kmt , restoring the two - party system that reigned before the np was formed . another significant possibility is that new party members , who tend to support james soong , could organize a brand - new political party with remnant soong backers after the election . shao tsung - hai , a professor at national chengchih university and a campaign staffer for james soong , states : soong has reiterated that he personally has no intention of organizing a new political party after the election .
but the political forces that support him will necessarily have to organize themselves in some fashion . moreover , after lee teng - hui leaves the scene , and the np no longer has that fixation , the possibility of establishing a new party with soong 's other supporters -lrb- who by no means necessarily dislike lee -rrb- increases . if this happens , the new party will no longer be in decline as it is now , but will re-emerge as a force to be reckoned with , and taiwan will be looking at a true three - party system . if lien chan is elected , the kmt will continue to hold both executive power and a legislative majority , and the premier will serve simply as the chief of staff to the president . however , based on current public opinion polls , it appears that whoever wins , lien included , will be only a " plurality president , " without a strong mandate to rule .
to a certain degree , then , he will have to accommodate other political forces . chang chun - hung , who knows the legislative environment very well , explains : " even now in order to pass important legislation there must be compromise and negotiations . it will be virtually impossible for the kmt to railroad through legislation under the leadership of a president who does n't enjoy majority public support . " the need for compromise could be further increased by the proposed law currently under discussion to put all party assets in blind trust .
this would , at least on paper , reduce the financial leverage the kmt would have over its legislators , and kmt representatives could become even more difficult for the party to control . lien chan may face the problem of being unable to enforce the decisions of the party center . if soong wins . . . . many supporters of james soong are people dissatisfied with the current state of the main parties .
it is generally believed that if soong wins the election , this could spark a dramatic reorganization of party politics . the main blow could fall on the new party , which could find itself made irrelevant , with the kmt also strongly affected . if soong wins , it is considered virtually inevitable that his supporters will organize some sort of political organization .
shao tsung - hai says frankly that , even if soong himself does not lead the way , his supporters - faced with the reality of party politics in taiwan - would have to organize in order to coordinate their operations . at the same time , according to public opinion surveys , an extremely high percentage of np members support soong .
if soong wins , it would be logical for these people to leave the np and join forces with other soong backers , thereby gutting the new party . np secretary - general lee ben - nan states : " as early as last year , the leadership realized that our party could potentially disappear " if soong wins .
but soong is the closest of the three main candidates to the np ideals , thus putting the np in a dilemma . the party nominated li ao to maintain the party profile , and the np leadership still calls on party members to support li , but also says it will understand if its members vote for another candidate . if soong wins , the kmt could also be thrown into crisis . in this election , several leading kmt figures have publicly come out in favor of james soong , and have been expelled from the kmt as a result . though these could be explained away as individuals who were not able to satisfy their personal ambitions inside the party , there are also many still in the kmt who secretly are pro-soong . if elected , soong will have a wealth of government resources with which to attract even more people to openly support him , and this could be the straw that breaks the kmt 's back .
based on this logic , lin wen - cheng says that an era of three - party politics is on the way .
though it is impossible to say whether such a situation would be stable , for those who are dissatisfied with the current choices and who want a reshuffling of party politics in taiwan , this is the opportunity to create a fresh climate .
chang chun - hung suggests that , in addition to uncertainty in party politics , a soong victory could also bring instability to taiwan 's constitutional system . except for some of his followers who were with him in the provincial government , soong 's camp lacks any experience in inter-group political bargaining . with soong as president , political elites in taiwan would be , as alexander lu describes it , like a basketball team whose players have never played together before .
soong 's camp will first have to integrate their own internal views , and then , to win confidence and trust from the legislative yuan , work with both the kmt and the dpp . such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .
although the kmt , dpp , and np all have legislators who might join the soong camp if soong wins , soong 's team will still need support from the kmt and/or the dpp , support they can only get through negotiation . past experience has shown that the kmt and dpp can work together to boycott executive yuan proposals ; if they do this to a soong - led executive branch , this could lead to a crisis ending in either a vote of no confidence or dissolution of the parliament .
the possibility of a constitutional crisis looks much greater under soong than under chen shui - bian or lien chan . the " he 's one of us " effect few voters can see the significance of this election for party politics . in this atmosphere of choosing among " individual heroes " rather than parties , voters are more concerned about the candidates ' characters and deportment than they are about their policy views or party backgrounds . that is why soong , who early on was significantly ahead of his rivals in public opinion polls , saw a dramatic drop in support after the chung hsing bills scandal broke .
meanwhile , newspapers and tv are filled with negative advertising in which candidates sling mud at one another . these ads are giving voters the impression that the nation 's future leaders are all " bad apples . " this not only marks the deterioration of electoral culture , but is a serious blow to morale in the nation and society .
the effects may prove to be far - reaching . chang chun - hung adds that negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country , are not - bad as they are - the biggest threat . he says taiwan voters should most be on the lookout for the " one of us " effect .
mobilization of votes based on ethnicity or provincial origin is the cheapest route to victory . this has long been a tactic used in taiwan elections . as a result , taiwan 's ethnic groups are pitted against one another politically .
lin wen - cheng states that in terms of daily life , differences between taiwan 's ethnic groups have largely disappeared . but , because ethnic cleavages are constantly being exploited in elections , inter-group political conflict remains serious . lin contends : " it is inevitable that minority groups in any society feel insecure about their status . in the last election for the mayor of taipei , it was obvious that virtually all mainlanders voted for ma ying - jeou . because the majority taiwanese do not feel threatened , they were less likely to vote based on provincial origin , giving ma enough cross-over votes to beat out chen shui - bian . in this upcoming election , james soong [ who is a mainlander ] is also getting a lot of support from hakka people , who sympathize with his outsider status and remember his support for hakka identity . "
unfortunately , however " natural " it is that minority groups feel insecure , exploitation of these cleavages for electoral gain can only have a negative long - term impact on society as a whole . in the 2000 election , taiwan will not only be choosing a new leader .
it will also be choosing a new direction for party politics , and will help decide future relations between the two sides of the taiwan strait and between ethnic groups in taiwan . how can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? how can they monitor their new leader to ensure that taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? these are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .
full press court : media exchanges boost foreign ties -lrb- / tr. by phil newell -rrb-
the fourth television news seminar for friendly nations , sponsored by the government information office , began just after the lunar new year .
this event , like the three preceding it , brings media professionals from countries with formal diplomatic ties with the roc to taiwan to receive training .
each year the course is offered in a different language to accomodate different participating countries : in 1987 it was in spanish , in 1998 english , and in 1999 french . the results so far have been good . where do these media professionals come from ? what do they take home with them ?
is this helpful in consolidating roc diplomatic relations ? the fourth television news seminar for friendly nations began on february 21 , and will last for 19 days .
activities include lectures on communications and broadcast theory , visits to domestic media , and activities to help the visitors understand the people and culture of taiwan .
through these activities , the gio hopes to give these citizens from the roc 's diplomatic - partner states both knowledge and warm hospitality .
most of those attending this year 's course come from anglophone countries in the caribbean basin . these include grenada , st. vincent and the grenadines , dominica , and st. kitts and nevis -lrb- all eastern caribbean islands -rrb- and belize -lrb- on the central american isthmus -rrb- . this year 11 high - level media professionals , media owners , and front - line journalists are in attendance .
according to the gio , the study session is the result of agreements to boost journalistic exchange , and is an innovative and concrete way to implement these agreements .
most of those attending hold high positions in their domestic media . during their stay in taiwan , they are not only introduced to media elites in taiwan and to the local media environment and facilities , but can also gain a greater knowledge of the land and people of the republic of china . this they can take home to share with their fellow citizens , thereby helping the roc 's diplomatic partners and their peoples to understand taiwan better .
the sessions have been run by the broadcasting development fund . lecturers are mainly broadcasting and journalism experts from taiwan . this year they include michael kuan , andrew hsia , and jason blatt .
the course includes classes on political broadcasting , international broadcasting information / propaganda strategies , and digital television broadcast development , as well as visits to the central broadcasting corporation , taiwan television corporation , eastern tv , and other media outlets .
generally speaking , the participants are very interested in taiwan 's high - tech industries and products . visits to the kuanghua computer market have proven especially popular . the visitors are generally favorably impressed by the prosperity of taipei city and by the consumer behavior of taiwanese .
in a television interview , television news producer marcus bailey from maitland tv of grenada said that he has learned a great deal about the editing facilities and techniques used in taiwan television , and that he would be able to apply this information in his own television production work when he returned home . this experience , he said , has deepened his desire to get further involved in television production work . he added that he would very much enjoy an opportunity to work together with colleagues from taiwan television . section chief victor chu of the gio , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course .
after returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in taiwan . thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .
chu says that the concrete results of the course will only become visible with a longer time frame . this is just like overall relations between two countries : they can only be consolidated by a long period of continual exchange . p. 79 most of the participants at the fourth television news seminar for friendly nations came from english - speaking caribbean nations with which the roc enjoys official relations . p. 92 did aliens also come to have a look at the taipei lantern festival ? do n't be silly , this is the taipei lantern festival 's main theme lantern : " the millenium gold dragon . " standing 17 meters tall and 18 meters wide , it 's a gold dragon embracing a globe , and it is supposed to convey the idea of a dragon bringing good luck to the world . -lrb- photo by hsueh chi - kuang -rrb- p. 93 the " information dragon , " which has a lively cartoon - like appearance , presents another side of dragons .
it 's a favorite of children . -lrb- photo by jimmy lin -rrb- p. 93 the " nine dragon lanterns " - each striking a different pose - lend an imperial aura to the main gate of the cks memorial . -lrb- photo by jimmy lin -rrb- p. 95 butterflies , flying birds , swimming fish , and peacocks . these may not have the flash of the large electrically lit lanterns found at the cks memorial , but the traditional handmade lanterns at the lungshan temple have an enduring beauty all their own . -lrb- photo by pu hua - chih -rrb-
big managers on campus in recent years , advanced education for professionals has become a hot topic in the business community . with this trend , suddenly the mature faces of managers boasting an average of over ten years of professional experience have flooded in among the young people populating university campuses . in order to attract this group of seasoned adults pulling in over nt$ 1 million a year back to the ivory tower , universities have begun to establish executive mba -lrb- emba -rrb- programs .
in response , each year over 1000 mature professionals looking to recharge their minds and retool their know - how compete for a precious few openings in executive degree programs at top institutions such as national taiwan university -lrb- ntu -rrb- and national chengchi university .
what brings these accomplished business professionals back to the classroom ?
what knowledge do they seek that can not be found in society at large ?
and what effect does their return have on campus ?
morris chang , chairman of tsmc and a leading light of taiwan 's high - tech industry , is the hottest university lecturer around .
two years ago , national chiaotung university invited chang , one of the taiwan it sector 's most prominent success stories , to lecture to students in its mba program for top managers , single - handedly raising awareness of executive mba -lrb- emba -rrb- programs .
this year , acer group chairman stan shih will be a guest lecturer at the university . the crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the mba program at taiwan 's most illustrious institution of higher education - national taiwan university - ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations .
various indications demonstrate that the " back flow education " promoted by the ministry of education has become the hottest investment undertaking among taiwan 's universities . three years ago , in the effort to establish a greater diversity of higher educational avenues , the ministry of education -lrb- moe -rrb- greatly increased the number of ma degrees open to professionals in the workforce , steadily reducing the proportion of regular students to professionals from the previous 9 - to - 1 ratio .
in addition , the moe allowed universities to determine entrance examination topics , testing dates and times , and fee structures individually to help them find and obtain the best students .
always in search of revenue sources , universities naturally fell right into line .
twelve institutions opened programs in 1999 , with the number of executive degree programs growing to 34 as of this year .
and as the supply has grown , professionals looking to recharge their intellectual batteries in disciplines ranging from chinese , foreign languages , and physics to information technology and management now have a greater selection from which to choose .
management white - hot
a wide range of programs is available , but popularity varies greatly .
last year , national taiwan university of science and technology -lrb- ntust -rrb- opened the doors of five of its graduate schools to professionals in the workforce . among them , the institute of fiber planned to accept 10 students , but only 20 applied , resulting in a 50 % acceptance rate ; meanwhile , the institute of mechanical engineering had only 30 applicants for 10 spots .
similarly , nine graduate institutes at ntu , including mechanical engineering , three principles of the people , and biology , opened degree programs to professionals last year . expecting to accept 167 students , they attracted a mere 330 - combined applicants .
compared to the lukewarm popularity of other graduate programs , management institutes are white hot .
the ntust college of management attracted nearly 500 applicants with over 10 years of work experience for 20 spots in its executive management program beginning in 1999 .
ntu 's college of management opened its doors to 44 professionals on a trial basis in 1996 , attracting a phenomenal 990 applicants . when 95 spots were offered the following year , the number of applicants rose again to 1400 .
currently , around a dozen public and private universities in taiwan , including ntu , national chiaotung university , national sun yat - sen university , da - yeh institute of technology , and yuan - ze institute of technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . what is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?
liao ching - jong , director of the ntust college of management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know - how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .
and while most recent university graduates are able to apply professional know - how upon entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught management in the workplace . hence universities are the place for systematic instruction on management .
" given the speed at which the business environment is changing , many new concepts were not previously taught , " says wu se - hwa , dean of national chengchi university 's college of commerce . wu notes that such new fields as venture capital , technology management , intellectual property , and e-commerce are all recent additions to the curriculum over the past few years .
professor tang ming - je of ntu 's college of management adds : " with small , medium - size and family businesses forming the backbone of taiwanese industry , one could do just fine without professional management . but in the age of the global village , many bosses are finding that relying on ' instinct ' to make business decisions is not enough , and that they need systematic management concepts . "
other management experts note that once taiwan joins the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , foreign universities will be able to recruit students directly in taiwan , and that with the ministry of education asking national universities to come up with a portion of their own funding , universities are doubly motivated to establish programs of this sort .
ntu , which enjoys the distinction of being taiwan 's premier institution of higher education , " never lacks for students , because there are always people who want to attend ntu , " says tang ming - je .
more than a diploma
in order to accommodate professionals with day jobs , many universities have scheduled their business management courses during evening hours . the sight of professionals in suits and ties rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh - faced undergrads .
shuttling between the office and the campus , do they ever feel like they 're burning the candle at both ends ?
at some schools , even professionals boasting ph.d. degrees are coming back to school for master 's degrees .
is the degree really that important to them ? mouton lee , in charge of over 80 employees and production of key components as president of abba linear tech co. , ltd. , is a second - year student in the ntust graduate school of management .
lee relates that as a youth he studied because he was forced to , but now his motivations for learning are far greater - so great in fact that he registered for three classes at the start of the semester , a decision he has come to regret for lack of time . lee , who has also taken short - term management courses , says , " degree programs are better , since the pressure makes you grow . "
mouton lee would like a master 's degree , yet today he studies for the knowledge it brings .
ever since graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from ntust and setting out to start his own business over 20 years ago , that degree has sat in a drawer somewhere , relegated to mere symbolic significance .
hsieh sun - chi , director of the control yuan 's office of information management and a 25 - year veteran of civil service , relates that he has already attained the highest rank a general civil servant can achieve , yet at the age of 50 he still has over a decade until retirement . two years ago , this led him to consider taking a new direction , and he tested into national chengchi university 's college of commerce intent on making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .
chang chin - tsung , a researcher at the chung - shan institute of science & technology with a ph.d. in mechanical engineering from a us university , shuttles between his office in taoyuan s lungtan and the ntu campus three days each week .
long immersed in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , chang says he feels like he " has gotten into a mental rut . " although hsinchu 's national chiaotung university offers a similar management curriculum , he was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields . thus he would rather spend the extra time commuting to ntu to be around students with experience in such fields as advertising , finance , and architecture .
" i 'd be lying if i said the degree does n't matter . if it did n't , why not just get into a non-degree program ? the truth is that a degree in management does nothing to help me in my current job , but it gives me a second skill if i choose another route in the future . "
advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over the past two years , but continuing education is nothing new among taiwan 's universities . for instance , national chengchi university 's public administration center has offered graduate extension courses for executives for over a decade , the difference being that , upon completion of the curriculum students only receive a certificate of course credit .
in comparison , a master 's degree is far more appealing , given that a degree is awarded upon completion of studies . burning the proverbial candle motivated by the degree or not , the enthusiasm of these professionals for their studies is impressive .
nevertheless , they must pay a hefty price to be able to study in the first place .
first , working during the day and attending classes at night is often a war of energy and will . next , they must shuffle their work schedules to accommodate their studies . many of them have to reschedule business trips . meanwhile , some become highway speeders , rushing from taoyuan or hsinchu to attend class .
and female managers , ordinarily responsible for household chores as well , really burn the proverbial candle at both ends . " i have my time perfectly allotted , " says morna lee , taiwan regional business manager for kellogg 's . she divides her schedule into three - month cycles , and with one class on thursday afternoons , her company does its best to accommodate her by not holding meetings that involve her on that day of the week .
still , sometimes nothing can be done , such as the time that she had a meeting in hong kong early one friday morning , forcing her to miss class on thursday while she flew to hong kong . she had to fly quickly back to taipei to make class on saturday afternoon .
despite often staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 am to study or write reports , lee likes mingling in the executive management class with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas the professors feed them help keep her brain supple . moreover , she muses , " we managers are a strange breed .
if we do n't exhaust ourselves , we end up sick . "
female professionals like morna lee represent a minority among executive degree students , accounting for just about five percent .
" if you asked me whether work or family is more important , i would say that since entering society 20 years ago work has always come first , " states donna sun , vice president of the human resource division at schmidt scientific taiwan . even if she has no classes to attend , leaving the office at 8:00 pm is no different from the perspective of her family life than the extra hour she spends attending classes until 9:00 pm . she is thankful that her son , a university student , and her daughter , a third - year junior high school student , have always been very independent and self - reliant .
hiring someone to help with housework , lee is a model for the children when it comes to studying , even taking them to the library on breaks to conduct research . no magic bullet compared to young students focused on getting a degree , the motivations of professionals studying for advanced degrees " are not that simple . "
they might be after new knowledge , keen to sport a fancy degree from a graduate school like ntu or chengchi university , out to network with others , or looking out for the survival of business and to raise competitiveness by searching for answers to difficult work or business issues .
" looking for quick answers from professors is a misguided concept , " says tang ming - je , professor of strategic management at ntu 's department of international business .
before commencing a course , tang tells his students , " i am not in the consulting business .
there are no magic bullets , for if i had any i 'd have gotten rich long ago . " wu se - hwa , dean of national chengchi university 's college of commerce , relates , " academic institutions provide systematic thinking , not the answers to specific questions . "
wu tells his students that if they put other things aside and concentrate on their studies for three weeks , maybe they 'll find the answer themselves . wu notes that adult students bring rich practical experience to the table , and lack only the knowledge to combine and integrate scattered experience .
for them , returning to school is valuable for establishing their own modes of thinking with the knowledge they pick up .
unlike the 20th century , where the amount of capital was the greatest factor determining success , wu se - hwa believes that the next century will be about " knowledge as the main competitive force . "
the book the 500 - year delta notes that in the 1960s each executive might only have to learn one new skill each year , such as how to use a computer or send e-mail .
by the 1990s , accumulation of know - how accelerated many times over , so that executives needed to learn something new each day .
now , in the 21st century , each manager might have to learn something new every single hour of the working day .
curriculums need selling points
in order to satisfy students with diverse expectations and needs for basic knowledge , what innovative means must a professor resort to ?
and what challenges does this pose for the institution itself ?
people are going to fall asleep no matter what , so you have to think on your feet and use different techniques to stimulate their attention , " remarks mark gia - khy tang , professor in the department of risk management and insurance at national chengchi university . students who have been away from the classroom for well over a decade can not be expected to remember all the formulas they learned in statistics and economics classes way back when . nor should classes turn into solo performances by the professor .
professor tang 's approach is to lecture on theory for the first hour , then use the remaining time on the homework that each group worked on since the previous week .
tang 's own " three no's " policy guides his teaching approach : no midterms , no final exams , and no calling on students . instead , grades are based on homework results and class participation .
tang 's risk management class is discussing how to identify risks .
one of the questions is : " if there were a fairy who could spell out for you exactly what you would experience for the rest of your life , consider what advantages and disadvantages the following information might have for you . for instance , no matter how hard you work , you are still fated to be poor all your life . or what if you were fated to have everything go your way ? what if , for example , you 're going to be elected to the legislature , or become the president ? "
tom lin , associate professor of marketing at ntust , describes the main difference between teaching adult executives and regular students : " executives are always asking questions . even when they have an idea themselves , they 'll still bring up issues they encountered in their jobs to see how you respond . " often , says lin , such questions leave him stumped .
another issue for adult students always on the run is their unfamiliarity with the campus . in order to enhance their sense of identification with the school , ntust designed an overseas business camp program . last year , one professor made a big hit with over 30 students , taking them to mainland china for over ten days to familiarize them with the investment environment there . this year , trips are planned to japan and silicon valley in the united states . planting in fertile soil
judging from the manner in which universities are opening their doors for continuing education , non-degree programs , and professional training , higher education in taiwan appears to be undergoing a sort of makeover . with these changes , universities must not only take care of teaching and research , but must also make sure they play their third function properly - spreading knowledge and sharing it with the public .
still , detractors point out that university graduate programs for business executives appear to be elitist .
one student attending a non-degree program at ntust relates that there are not enough spots to go around in the executive degree programs . hoping to make the switch from the non-degree program , he failed to pass the screening that is administered prior to the admissions test . " if you fail a test , you only have yourself to blame , but tripping up on the initial screening is just a matter of not having a high enough job title . "
each year when emba program acceptances are released , newspapers carry letters from readers relating how certain national university graduate schools compete to accept ceos and presidents of listed corporations , or the children of rich business people .
the ntust student expresses cynicism toward the application and review process , suspecting that " they just pay attention to company name and job title . " moreover , continuing education courses charge hefty tuition fees . for instance , ntu divides the school year into three semesters , at nt$ 50,000 per semester , while other institutions charge between nt$ 3700 and $ 10,000 per credit , a full two to three times more than regular graduate student tuition . such instances naturally lead to suspicion that graduate schools such as these are " out to make a killing " by catering only to an elite few .
" from review , to written test , to oral exam , in order to ensure fairness , no professor is involved in more than one portion of the process , " says huang chung - hsing , director of the emba program at ntu .
still , huang admits that the bigger the company and higher the candidate 's job title , the greater their chances of acceptance into the program . this can be partially attributed to the belief among professors that the commitment of their educational resources yields " more bang for the buck . "
as tang ming - je forthrightly explains , university professors ' time is a national resource , and if they can have a positive impact on an executive controlling budgets of billions of nt dollars , their contribution to country and society is considerable .
asks liao ching - jong , director of the ntust graduate school of management , concurs , " which is greater , the marginal benefit of a company president or a staff member 's education ? the president can go back and put what she learns into practice right away . "
what is more , even if schools do not deliberately seek out company presidents , they invariably perform better on oral exams - perhaps due to their greater experience .
" we must ask ourselves some questions , too , when embas are thought of as giving away degrees to the privileged few , " comments wu se - hwa . wu tells his professors that unless they perform well in class , the emba can not develop further , as universities are founded upon academic research .
as for tuition policies , wu se - hwa relates that with an annual budget of nt$ 2.1 billion , national chengchi university spends about nt$ 200,000 per student . thus , when it comes down to calculating costs , nt$ 10,000 per credit is actually quite cheap .
industry retooling
the emba craze reflects the cold , intense competition of social darwinism , but does it also signify that taiwanese industry is beginning to devote greater attention to the training of top executives ?
many scholars believe that with the emba phenomenon just getting off its feet in taiwan , many corporate bosses are taking a " wait - and - see " attitude . this is reflected in the way students approach the programs , not informing their bosses that they have applied to a program until they have been accepted , and not occupying work time if school takes place in the evening . this way , their boss 's attitude has no particular bearing on what they do .
perhaps business education may not be widespread in taiwan at this time , yet a small number of company bosses have taken the lead themselves - taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel .
ma yu - shan , chairman of kingdom construction and 64 years old this year , tested into ntu 's college of management in 1998 , becoming ntu 's oldest student .
for ma , " living and learning " is more than just a maxim , as each year kingdom construction employees are required to undergo 80 hours of on - the - job training .
" for the boss to lead his team , he ca n't just tell his subordinates to learn , while he remains static himself . not to mention that in discussions with employees , if they know you 're the kind of boss who does n't seek to further himself , they put less stock in what you say , " notes ma . with the rapid changes in the business environment , poor decision - making can have serious consequences for company development . " the pressure on the boss is tremendous , because nobody comes to the ceo with easy questions . "
too busy to attend regular courses , ma yu - shan took the advice of an ntu professor and hired a ph.d. student to tutor him one semester in " management economics . " amber huang , president of changhua 's feng huei steel & iron company , is a student in the department of business administration at ntust .
huang notes three advantages of the boss going to school . first , it 's good for his company 's image . as his company must frequently seek bank loans , huang asks rhetorically , " could a studious boss be a bad guy ? " this image has helped him secure loans with little difficulty every time .
second , it sets a good example for employees . lastly , speaking the professional lingo fluently helps enhance his authority .
knowledge for the new century
in the effort to cultivate management talent , many prominent multinational corporations have founded their own teaching institutions , toyota university and intel university being two good examples . in taiwan , the acer group 's aspire academy opened its doors in lungtan -lrb- taoyuan country -rrb- last october after three years of planning .
during the aspire academy opening ceremony , academy president stan shih , chairman of the acer group , remarked that he hopes to introduce management models from europe and america and mesh them with the unique attributes of taiwanese industry to enhance the globalization of asian business . shih noted that through the sharing of experiences , emerging businesses might save themselves a lot of groping in the dark .
are people at the fin de siecle inspired to learn by the confluence of technology , humanities , and economic knowledge ?
at least the entrepreneurs , managers , and executives in campuses around taiwan clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth .
home is where the heart is community activism in a small hakka town -lrb- chang chiung - fang / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by david mayer -rrb-
last year 's earthquake may have de-stroyed families and toppled homes , but it also brought people closer together and created new links between local communities . this has especially been the case with peipu -lrb- hsinchu county -rrb- and shihkang -lrb- taichung county -rrb- .
these two rural towns are alike in many ways . each is predominantly hakka , each is located in north - central taiwan , and each has about 10,000 inhabitants . since last year , however , there has been one huge difference -
the earthquake decimated shihkang but left peipu virtually unscathed . the earthquake killed more people in shihkang than any other township in taiwan , and shihkang remains largely in ruins a half year later . peipu , in the meantime , enjoys a booming tourist industry that just keeps growing .
since the earthquake , peipu 's ta ai community affairs center -lrb- tcac -rrb- has lent sustained assistance to shihkang in a remarkable display of how a disaster can bring out the best in people .
" donations and volunteers came flooding in immediately after the earthquake , " says shihkang mayor hsieh chen - ying , " but we all knew that it would n't last for long .
the task of rebuilding is the hard part . it 's going to take a long time . " the city of taipei " adopted " shihkang after the earthquake , assigning personnel from its various ward offices to stay on long - term in shihkang and assist with earthquake recovery .
mighty taipei , however , is joined in this task by peipu 's tcac , which is among the few organizations that have provided continuous assistance ever since the quake .
peipu lends a helping hand says shu shih - wei , director of tcac , " there is just so much to do after a disaster of this magnitude . tcac and the people of peipu have only got so many resources . "
in the little community of peipu , tcac managed to collect three truckloads of relief supplies and over nt$ 400,000 after the earthquake . in order to put it to the best possible use , they toured the disaster area several times and decided to devote all their energies to help the recovery effort in the township of shihkang in taichung county .
the two towns are not so far apart - about two hours by car . besides their common ethnicity , the seriousness of the damage in shihkang was a major reason why tcac chose to concentrate on shihkang .
shihkang is located on the banks of the tachia river , and was one of the areas most heavily hit by the quake , with 178 deaths , over 1,200 buildings totally destroyed , more than 500 homes partially destroyed , and dozens of historic old structures demolished .
tcac had already been active in community development efforts in peipu , and its members knew from this experience that rebuilding from the earthquake would take a long time , so they set up shihkang work station at tuniu elementary school in late october and made plans to stay for a year .
shihkang newsletter the main task of the work station is to publish the fortnightly shihkang newsletter . the first edition of this one - page newsletter went out last november 8th . it reports on everyday life in the disaster area and matters related to the recovery effort .
tcac 's li chieh - ying has been working full - time at the shihkang work station since november . according to li , the newsletter is extremely important to people in the disaster area for a couple of reasons . firstly , it enables people to share information .
people can see that they are not alone in their suffering , and that they must address their situation from a collective standpoint instead of chasing after individual problems one at a time .
secondly , people in the disaster area need information from the outside world , and now that the news media have shifted their attention to other matters , the local people need an avenue by which to get their message out to the rest of the world .
the newsletter is just the thing to accomplish these objectives . this newsletter has also helped to spur increased contact between the people of peipu and shihkang . according to li chieh - ying , they distribute 3,000 copies of the shihkang newsletter in shihkang , 500 in tungshih and shinshe , and 1,000 in peipu , which enables the people of peipu to truly get a feel for what is needed in the disaster area .
by sending a person to serve full - time at the shihkang work station , tcac has managed to quickly integrate itself into the local community in shihkang , and to see where assistance is most urgently needed .
the children of shihkang , for example , are in especially great need of psychological counseling , so tcac asked the hsiuh - li liuh memorial foundation to provide therapy for children and teachers .
in addition , the shihkang work station is also helping to build prefab shelters .
the far eastern group only donated 50 prefab units , and people in less than privileged situations -lrb- such as renters and those living in illegally constructed residences -rrb- were not even eligible to apply for them , so tcac has been working hard to put up prefab units for the residents of tzu - yun lane .
several old residences collapsed there , causing numerous deaths and injuries .
the work on the prefab units has been a race against time , for as shu shih - wei points out , some people in the disaster area have died of cold over the winter .
to survive the great earthquake only to die because of an inadequate relief effort seems the height of injustice . a non-hakka in peipu
how has tcac managed to deliver such steady assistance to people in the disaster area ?
what do they have that sets them apart ?
it all has to do with their experience with community activism in peipu .
you wo n't find the name ta ai on a map of hsinchu county , for it is an administrative division not of the roc government , but of the famous yimin temple of northern hsinchu . the ta ai area encompasses the three townships of peipu , paoshan , and omei . yimin temple commands the allegiance of hakka faithful in 15 different temple districts , of which the ta ai district is one .
peipu township lies immediately southwest of the town of chutung , and is surrounded by mountains . over 95 % of its roughly 12,000 residents are hakka .
located in the center of peipu is tzu - tien temple , the town 's main landmark , and the bustling streets that run past the temple offer the best shopping and eating in town . tcac operates out of an office in the middle of town . the traditional architecture of the building is a very pleasant sight .
shu shih - wei , the key mover and shaker at tcac , was born to parents from the mainland and grew up in kaohsiung .
formerly a professor at chung yuan christian university , he first came to peipu ago to help a colleague study the local architecture .
shu 's role in the project was to study the sociology of peipu and gain a clear understanding of life in a small hakka town . shu ended up staying on in peipu after the project came to an end , and today he serves as director of tcac .
says shu , " now i can understand about 60 - 70 % of what people say in hakka ! " how it all started tcac was established almost by accident .
after settling in peipu , shu gradually put down roots in the local community and made friends .
in the summer of 1996 , shu and a few women got to talking about education and they hatched an idea to set up an after - school study center . the local catholic church donated space for the center , and the project was soon launched . they also set up a small library , and local residents generously donated many books .
thanks to the center , a group of concerned local citizens started seeing each other quite frequently , and they ended up establishing ta ai community affairs center in march 1997 .
they chose chiang yi - sen , the owner of a local dry goods store , as the chairman , and selected shu as director . the new organization resolved to work toward the achievement of four goals : " a better standard of living , in both the material and spiritual sense . preservation and development of hakka culture .
preservation of the environment and development of local industry . development of community education for people of all ages . " after tcac was officially established , its main project was the publication of a bimonthly newsletter .
the tcac newsletter provided the people of peipu with an opportunity to speak their minds on such issues as preservation of local streams , their love for their hometown , and various local affairs . pitching in
a young man wrote in the tcac newsletter , " i used to have a job in another town , and every time i came back to peipu i would go straight to the noodle shop and wolf down a bowl of bantiao noodles even before stopping to say hello to my parents . until i had eaten a bowl of bantiao , i did n't feel like i was back home yet . "
according to shu shih - wei , keeping the newsletter in print for two or three years has been no small accomplishment . " these people do n't write for a living .
a person might spend four or five hours writing up a short little article . " in addition to the newsletter , tcac has also been involved in many local activities . " a lot of interesting stuff goes on in a small hakka town , " says shu , adding that when help is needed the locals are likely to contribute not just money but something even more valuable - their time and energy .
when tcac puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . when a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience .
" if the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations . that is why tcac has been able to carry out so many activities over the past three years without spending any money . peipu residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns , flea markets , and post-harvest yam roasts , and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town .
according to chiang yi - sen , when tcac organized a camping trip last year , participants from chutung , toufen , and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals . we miss our walkways !
thanks to the energy and dedication of nine regular staff and many enthusiastic volunteers , tcac has managed to make a difference in this small hakka township over the past three years .
most notably , the people of peipu have begun to sense the value of what they 've got in their community .
the campaign to beautify peipu 's hsia street is an excellent case in point . seven years ago , in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion , the township widened hsia street . the project required demolition of all the covered walkways that used to stand outside the stores there .
it seemed like a laudable move toward modernization at the time , but people living along the street came to rue the loss of their covered walkways .
cars came roaring down in great numbers along the widened street , while the residents lost the space in front of their homes where they had once enjoyed many a leisurely hour .
according to chiang yi - sen , whose store is located on hsia street , everybody used to congregate in the cool shade of the walkways in the summer .
neighbors were more involved with each other , and his two children always had a place to play .
now that the covered walkways have been replaced by parking spaces , people scarcely leave their homes .
the old folks stay inside watching television , while the young people only emerge briefly on their way to work .
people rarely have a chance to speak to each other anymore .
fortunately , the people of peipu quickly realized their mistake .
last year tcac applied to the council for cultural affairs for authorization to carry out a campaign to beautify hsia street . the residents did everything they could to restore something of their former neighborhood . they erected street lamps and put out benches where people could sit and chat , and have succeeded in creating a very friendly atmosphere . the gaily lit hsia street seems almost to have returned to an earlier time .
it might be impossible for hsia street to ever be exactly the same as it once was , but the beautification campaign taught the people of peipu the value of what they have .
when the town hall made plans to rip up the stone steps on the long pathway leading up the mountainside at hsiuluan park and replace them with imported stone , local citizens protested , asking the town hall to leave the steps as they were .
in the end they succeeded in keeping part of the steps untouched . states chiang with a sigh , " there 's not much left that 's really worth passing on to our grandchildren .
we ca n't keep destroying things . " do you remember ? the scope of tcac activities is not limited to improving the quality of old neighborhoods .
the organization is also active in the effort to preserve the local environment .
shu shih - wei points out that for an agricultural community like peipu , streams are an indispensable resource .
aquatic life on taping river , however , is dwindling due to destruction of the surrounding environment and excessive gravel mining on the river bed .
last april , over 50 people from the townships of peipu and omei organized the tcac taping river preservation team . in addition to holding meetings throughout the local area to show slides and publicize the river 's plight , the river preservation team also posted notices on the riverbank in may asking locals and out - of - town visitors not to poison or electrocute fish or catch them in nets .
the team also goes out occasionally to pick up trash and patrol the river .
besides these activities , tcac also offers regularly scheduled classes for both children and adults .
current offerings include a class on environmental preservation for children , while for both children and adults there are classes on calligraphy , traditional hakka folk songs , and local history .
every wednesday evening you can hear the strains of hakka folk songs coming from tcac .
the youngest participants in the class are just seven or eight , while the oldest range on up to 70 or 80 .
every one of the lilting melodies carries with it a nugget of hakka culture . even more interestingly , the teacher makes up lyrics about the river preservation campaign and sets them to traditional folk melodies , thus melding the old and the new . in the class on local history , the participants themselves do all the talking .
they exchange stories about the past and talk about places whose names no longer even appear on the maps . everyone works in this way to call up a collective memory of local history . says shu shih - wei , " by sharing our experiences we can get everybody to take an active interest in the changes that are taking place in the local community . " outgrowths of the class include the river preservation campaign and a guidebook for tourists interested in learning about environmental issues and local history . says shu , " forget about all the high - falutin' talk about ' urban redevelopment ' and whatnot - everyone cares about what goes on in their town .
but you 've got to find a way to get everybody working together so you can actually get something done , otherwise all talk about local affairs wo n't amount to anything more than people doing a bit of idle chatting and complaining around the dinner table . " hard times , warm hearts
with such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , tcac was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central taiwan last september . after zeroing in on shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , tcac wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters .
in working together on the recovery effort , the people of peipu and shihkang have built up close personal ties .
at a new year 's celebration in peipu , shihkang mayor hsieh chen - ying gave the people of peipu a gift as a token of gratitude for their generous assistance , and when tcac board members traveled to shihkang to inspect the progress on the prefab shelters , they took advantage of the occasion to exchange views with local residents .
" i 'm very excited about the two - way channel of communication that we 've established , " says li chieh - ying , and he adds that this communication is a source of strength that has enabled the shihkang work station to keep going .
the prefab units that tcac helped build at tuniu elementary school were completed on february 28th , and li chieh - ying reports that the shihkang work station is now concentrating primarily on gaining a clear picture of what is needed to get people back to work .
although the original plan only calls for the shihkang work station to operate for one year , li chieh - ying opines , " i have my doubts about whether we 'll actually be able to leave after a year . " he feels that the cooperative relationship and emotional ties that have been forged between peipu and shihkang ought to be kept alive , and he hopes that the people of ta ai will be able to share their know - how in community activism with other localities so that taiwan can recover the vibrant communities that it lost in the earthquake . p. 100 peipu 's ta ai community affairs center built 11 prefab shelters at tuniu elementary school in shihkang . performers of traditional hakka music came from both peipu and shihkang to celebrate the completion of the shelters . p. 102 the sight of the river spilling over a newly created drop - off in the formerly flat riverbed at shihkang dam gives stunning testimony to the power of last year 's earthquake . the bridge is being left as is to serve as a monument to the quake . p. 102 in a perverse twist of fate , the terrible destruction wrought by the earthquake has left shihkang with a lot of valuable new " tourist attractions . " this enterprising shop owner is selling photos of the disaster area . p. 105 located in the center of peipu , tzu - tien temple is the town 's main landmark and features a big open area that is excellent for holding various activities . the musical performance pictured here has attracted a big crowd of both locals and out - of - town visitors . -lrb- courtesy of ku cheng - chien -rrb- p. 106 the people of peipu have come to understand the value of their heritage , and have begun working to preserve old buildings . in restoring old residences , they are eschewing modern building materials and using the methods of the past . a man is shown here mixing mud to daub over the brick walls . -lrb- courtesy of ku cheng - chien -rrb- p. 107 shop signs everywhere advertise such typical hakka items as bantiao noodles , lei tea -lrb- which has peanut powder and other high - calorie ingredients mixed into it -rrb- , and dried persimmons . peipu 's distinctly hakka atmosphere is perhaps the town 's most striking feature .
the age of the peacock " god gives a woman one face ; she can make another one for herself . "
this well - known expression is being amended by the behavior of men in the 21st century . the " male beauty pageant " at chiao tung university just ended , and it was quickly followed by a website male beauty contest . modern males not only are competing over looks , they also are competing over dressing themselves up and making themselves over .
in his book the art of life , the humorist lin yutang noted how " commercial advertising has commodified virtually every inch of a woman 's body , right down to the last line and the last painted toenail . "
now when you look at advertising billboards or magazines , you see men displaying their oiled - up muscles , shiny white teeth , smooth and clean - shaven skin , and elegant attire . the " new man " is making himself over from head to toe , and is not averse to showing a more feminine side in doing so . men are invading territory previously held exclusively by women , and are declaring : " ladies , you no longer have a monopoly on making yourselves beautiful ! "
" this summer , before putting on your shorts and sandals , be sure to do skin care treatment and thoroughly clean your legs , so that you can present a fresh clean image to people . " you would probably assume that this is an ad for a woman 's beauty product , would n't you ?
a men 's fashion magazine that sells over 10,000 copies per month in convenience stores cautions its male readers that if they want to have the " face of an angel , " then every day they must do " three - step skin care " to rid themselves of dead skin cells . men can now retain their youthful looks with moisturizing masks , wrinkle - removing patches , and techniques for tightening facial skin and giving the lines of the face a more pronounced depth .
of course , after facial care is finished , do n't forget to rub moisturizing cream into your calves ! everywhere advertisements are promoting the idea of the " peacock . " they are encouraging modern men to take practical steps to " decorate " themselves . the american cosmetics company clinique had sales over nt$ 1 million in the first month in which they released men 's skin care products in taiwan .
chu che - tao , the company 's director of education and training , declares : " the market potential for male skin - care products is unlimited . "
phone calls and internet inquiries from men asking about beauty products and services are outpacing the capacity of the industry to handle them . angela chiang , general manager of access cosmetics international , the taiwan agent for a number of imported perfumes , says that taiwan 's male fragrance market began to grow markedly in 1998 .
last year , some of the leading brands showed sales increases of 200 % .
many male clients have three or four different kinds of fragrance at home , using different ones for the office , long weekends , and so on .
in days gone by , it was considered an extravagance for dad to go down to the barbershop for a shave and haircut .
today beauty parlors are offering these aging gents the chance to lighten their spots , change their profiles , and have their wrinkles pulled away . one salon in hsinchu called modern man salon has adopted the slogan : " men and women are finally equal . " the determination of men in taiwan to redo themselves is rising .
men are giving away nothing to their sisters in the search for beautiful bodies , as is suggested by a few recent disputes between male beauty salons and dissatisfied customers .
according to statistics from early march 2000 from the wanfang hospital laser center , last year the ratio of men to women going for cosmetic surgery was 1 : 3 , compared to 1 : 5 just five years ago .
lai hsien - hung , a physician at the center , predicts that before long the ratio will reach 1 : 1 . show me the body it is frequently argued that it is a male - dominated society that creates the need for women to spend money making themselves up as if their lives depended on it .
but who should get the " credit " for this new male infatuation with beauty ?
besides the fact that advertising and sales pitches in a modern commercial society " seduce " some men into falling into the beauty trap , many observers suggest that a major force behind male vanity are women , especially the women closest to individual men .
betty wu , a famous author and television host , says that today seven out of ten modern guys who buy name - brand fashions and use cosmetics do so under the influence of their girlfriends . wu has found that " modern men can in fact easily accept change . "
indeed , as consumers men are often easier to deal with than women , as they are more decisive about purchasing .
when taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor .
few bothered to worry about their external appearance . even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies . but women have had enough of that , and these days have the economic wherewithal to do something about it .
in the past , women could only be recipients of gifts from men , but now they are able to buy gifts to give to their male partners . women are very familiar with the cosmetics market , and are now influencing the consumer behavior of their husbands and boyfriends . with a little help from women , men 's fashions have taken off :
" virtually all the major men 's fashion brands have been brought into taiwan in the last five years , " say justin lin , editor - in - chief of men 's uno , a well - known fashion magazine .
in the past , when foreign companies would release men 's and women 's fashion lines at the same time , taiwan importers would only bring in the women 's clothing ; now men 's and women 's attire comes in together .
men also are increasingly feeling pushed by women in the realm of cosmetic surgery and body shaping . many men have been encouraged by their wives to get surgery to change their single-fold eyelids to double-fold , or to have fat removed by liposuction .
one mother brought her middle school son to lin ching - yun 's cosmetic surgery hospital , saying : " i could n't give birth to a good nose for you , but at least i can have a good nose made for you . " macho macho man
in the view of betty wu , the reason men are daring to enter the ranks of beauty lovers , and even accept softer and more feminine standards of beauty , is because expectations of men in society have changed . the women of generation x , born after 1965 , have economic independence , and no longer are looking to men to support them and their children . thus they no longer are looking for someone who " walks and talks like a real man . "
in the past , the definition of " a real man " was usually one who could support a wife and children , and who would play the active role in a relationship , with the woman being the passive partner .
since more and more women do not expect a man to support them , what they are looking for in a man has also changed . wu croons , " we want men to be more juicy . " in the past it was no big deal if your male partner was n't really presentable , but now an important condition for a boyfriend is that one is not embarrassed to take him out in public .
says wu : " i just do n't understand what my mother saw in john wayne in his dirty old jeans .
" in the past women wanted to be coddled , now they want to coddle men . guys who evoke a woman 's sympathetic instincts and " non-threatening " types of " pretty boys " are becoming more and more popular .
lucia lee , a young office worker who regularly discusses social trends with webfriends on her own website , says that modern males no longer have that rough - tough character ; guys like hsieh ting - feng and chen hsiao - tung , who never have a hair out of place , are very popular male idols these days . when well - groomed male stars stand on stage next to their female counterparts , they both look equally " juicy . "
relax dudes social change is permitting women to devote more attention to admiring male beauty , and it also is allowing men to enjoy beautifying themselves . ning yin - bin , an associate professor in the graduate institute of philosophy at national central university , and an expert on gender issues , says that for a long time " society did not encourage men to spend time making themselves up or becoming more attractive to others . "
the role society assigned to men emphasized accomplishments in the outside world , so it was only legitimate for men to learn how to make a living .
wang hao - wei , a psychiatrist who frequently writes on the subject of men in taiwan , says that guys by nature find it hard to reveal their softer sides .
they can only put down their body armor after slugging a few drinks down . today , they 're getting a chance to express themselves through external beauty , and can show a softer side . he tu - lin , a tall and handsome television star , declared his own opinion - without the least bashfulness about it - on a recent radio program :
" the key factor allowing men to have the courage to display their own bodies is that they see their bodies as their own . their bodies no longer belong to a cultural tradition or to other people . as men love themselves more , they can transfer some of this self - love to their bodies . as a result , modern men have discovered that can they can make a statement about themselves through their clothes and their bodies . "
whether awakened to a new sense of their own bodies by popular culture , or driven to stay at the forefront of commercial fashion , contemporary men have certainly made a firm decision to make themselves more beautiful .
moreover , as the service industry has come to dominate the economy , a fresh and clean appearance - with absolutely none of that macho sweat thing allowed - has become considered simply good manners .
many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs .
yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men . a case in point : last year , singtsufang enterprise imported specially made underwear from japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look .
they originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by october , but in fact it went six months earlier .
kao -lrb- taiwan -rrb- corporation recently did a " millennial masculinity survey " in which 70 % of male respondents said that they could accept the idea of a man wearing cosmetics . many foreign manufacturers and advertisers are rubbing their hands in gleeful anticipation of getting a share of this market . chen yen - ying , director of public relations planning for kao , says that this year at least four companies will begin marketing skin care products for men .
from the celebrity advertisements in subway stations and on the sides of buses , you can see that in terms of market leaders like trendy fashions , hair styling , body sculpting , face care , and even undergarments , there is a tremendous amount of scope for a more diversified selection of products for men .
androgynous zone ideally , businesses and popular culture want to be able to sweep everyone up in a single net , and would prefer not to break their market up by gender .
it happens that many modern guys who go in for dressing up are also showing a trend toward androgynous standards of beauty . in fact , says betty wu , it is not only now that androgynous standards of beauty are starting to take root in taiwan .
although everyone has a different aesthetic sense , and there are many kinds of beauty , " you can still identify certain trends , " she says .
" some years the look is the tough , hard - nosed type , and other years a softer , more feminine look is in . "
look at some of the stars of early films in taiwan , like chin han , chin hsiang - lin , and liu wen - zheng , who had a definite elegance .
" they were tall and well - built , but very gentle , " opines wu .
these days , more and more women , in appreciating men , think that the " prettier " the guys are , the better .
justin lin , in his analysis of the pretty - boy phenomenon , avers : in the 1990s , the general trend of all cutting - edge design was " super-youth . "
many well - established products appealing to the upper middle - class found it impossible to resist the trend toward youth and had to change their own design and style . looking around , you can see a transition in the most popular types of male models . the muscle man and the james dean type are on the way out .
more and more the models are of the soft , almost feminine schoolboy type , the boy next - door type , or boys who look childish and underdeveloped , as if they lack experience .
you could say that people just got tired of looking at macho men and cool dudes . but as wang hao - wei sees it , the deeper cause of the current worship of ever - greater youthfulness in modern society can be traced to the dissolution of the traditional family structure . elders , who held all the power in the past , have become targets of derision . businesses have no choice but to go along with the trend .
wang concludes : " in a society in which individualism is important , youth is the best security . " besides adapting to rising individualism , ever - alert commercial culture is also taking advantage of feminism and homosexual self - awareness .
cross-gender thinking is influencing the way men make themselves appear . this is especially apparent in the entertainment community , which sets the pace for popular culture and is often the fastest to pick up on new trends .
many in that field are crossing traditional barriers between male and female . in the past only women had sequins , embroidery , or skin - revealing gaps as part of their clothing , but now these are being put in men 's clothing as well . recently , the top four hong kong male singing stars were seen on stage competing for attention while wearing skirts .
you can expect that it wo n't be long before you can admire some guy on the street wearing a skirt . the new generation of young women mostly have a positive attitude toward androgynous beauty . as lucia lee says , " raw masculinity or raw femininity is of course attractive , but the more diversified is the pursuit of beauty , the more interesting the world is .
as far as i 'm concerned , if a guy wants to wear a skirt or have long hair , as long as it looks good , anything goes . " the non-no set
male beauty is tending toward youth and gender neutrality , and those pursuing beauty are mainly young . they are the ones who most dare to and who can afford to . chen ta - wei , a 28 - year - old webpage designer , says that in his generation the girls grew up reading non-no and the boys grew up reading men 's non-no .
fashion magazines taught him to accept more colorful and cuter clothing , and now he knows name - brand fashions like the back of his hand . though he has already entered the working world , he still pays close attention to the men 's fashions introduced into magazines . " this year prada is putting out purple shoes that cost about nt$ 20 - 30,000 . doc marten 's millennial commemorative shoes have a similar style , but the price is much lower . i 'm thinking about buying the latter . "
girls who grew up reading non-no can accept the consumer attitude of the men 's non-no crowd .
both groups follow fashion closely , exchange information , and raise new ideas .
" i do n't work out to build muscles , but to define them . right now shape is what 's in . with a little bit of muscle , your clothes look even better . " chen ta - wei also has his own ideas about the skin care products on the market : " men 's skin care products all assume that men have oily skin with built up dead skin cells , so they have very strong cleaning agents . but these can damage your skin .
i prefer to use softer women 's skin tonic . " cabula chang , associate managing editor at chinatimes.com , who is now 40 , has a brother eight years younger than himself . he says that if he is the last of the " a - man 's - life - is - hard " generation , his younger brother will unfortunately be of a set whose lives will be even harder down the road .
this is because his younger brother , who invests an hour a day decking himself out , spends virtually all his money on clothing and pleasure . liu hsiang , a phd candidate who also teaches at an english supplementary school , says that it is certainly necessary to spend time and money if you want to give your exterior appearance a little character . the materials of the clothes and the hairstyle have to be just right .
and some labels do indeed represent quality . liu , who clears out his closet for each new season , currently has 25 pairs of shoes , and more than 30 shirts .
he feels that the expression " there are no ugly women , only lazy women " can equally be applied to men , so he also encourages his friends to pay more attention to their appearance to give people a better impression .
it has been said that " power is the greatest aphrodisiac , " and this is still true . but in the past , men with status simply neglected their physical appearance . today 's younger generation is n't content with knowing that they have power or ability ; young men today care about the impression they make on the outside as well .
beauty is an acquired trait some feel that the arrival of " the age of the peacock " is simply a reflection of the frivolousness of the younger generation .
public commentary was quite reserved on the incident of " chiao tung university has no handsome guys " and the subsequent " male beauty pageant " earlier this year . but , counters chen tsai - ching , director of guidance counseling at the lungshan middle school , it is in the nature of young people in whatever era to worry about their looks .
as she sees it , young people are no more vain now than they were in the past . it 's just that society is more open , and adults are more tolerant . they no longer have a negative , repressive attitude , and therefore young people are more daring about expressing themselves .
ko ching - ming , a professor of chinese at national taiwan university who is in his fifties , says , " i grew up with compulsory haircuts and school uniforms . " in the past , both boys and girls were required to keep their external appearance " non-provocative . " the new generation has more opportunities to express individuality through appearance .
in the youth sub-culture that aims for rebelliousness , dyed hair and pierced ears have become trademarks . ko sees this simply as the diversified choice that is available in a pluralistic society . " there 's no need to see it as an indicator of morality . "
chang shao - yu , a second year medical student at national taiwan university , says that in fact beauty is learned . some of his classmates are able to achieve a certain look without really investing too much effort simply because their parents devoted a lot of attention to clothes .
" the kids from my family , on the other hand , have to figure it out for ourselves . " his voice carries a tinge of regret . he and his mother rarely went shopping together or discussed how to evaluate the quality of clothes .
chang , who takes note of how others dress and of how fashions are matched in store displays , says that the point is not for parents to teach their children to be slaves to fashion , but to teach them how to dress with a sense of character and beauty .
whether or not you find this behavior among some men acceptable , it is an established fact .
tsai shih - ping , a " pretty boy " from the literary world who is now his 40s , sighs : " this is a new era , and men really can make a statement with their bodies . from a certain point of view , i believe that many men around my age feel very jealous , and even a sense of loss , when we see young guys with their personalized photo albums and their dressing up . "
dress for success ?
there is more at work here , however , than just looking good , and many men now feel , as many women have long felt , that dressing up is forced on them by society .
wang hao - wei notes that in this generation people are increasingly forced into situations in which appearance matters - for example , on the lecture podium , or in front of the tv camera or the camera lens . people need a greater sense of self - confidence , and feel more and more uncomfortable with their bodies .
so they strive more and more to recover lost confidence by enhancing their external appearance . " if you do n't have looks , and you ca n't dress well , you wo n't even be able to find a job as a clerk in a clothing store , which is ranked as one of the lowest status job categories , " says chen ta - wei . go to a clothing store and check it out for yourself -
you wo n't find any ugly guys working there . in fact , there is still a lot of discrimination in our society based on appearance . it is not only the young who want to look better , and it seems the attitudes of the kids are affecting their elders at home . besides supporting their families , guys in their 40s are also starting to worry about whether they are looking old , and whether their beer - guts are starting to show .
so they too are joining the ranks of those seeking cosmetic surgery and skin care treatments . men 's uno had one article which said : in the past , western guys lived for sun , sea , and sex .
these days , they think about how the sun causes skin cancer , the sea is filled with oil spills , and sex can be fatal .
thus a beautiful body , appropriate diet , and healthy recreation have become the new pursuits .
part of the reason middle - aged men seek better looks is also health , with health now encompassing the realm of skin care and looks as well . ning yin - bin suggests that it is hard to generalize about which group or groups are in the " beauty - loving set . "
he points to the fact that even politicians are playing this game . in this visual age , politics is closely tied in with performance . male politicians are careful about their appearance and attire .
with the help of male beauty salons , skin care products , and cosmetic surgery , these middle - aged men can also win the support of strangers just from their external appearance .
lin ching - yun , who often helps politicians with their images , says frankly that many politicos come to have their wrinkles and the bags under their eyes removed before they go for photo sessions .
and many government officials who often appear on tv have been patients in her cosmetic surgery clinic . the book , dear , i want you to look good for me is billing itself as " the first book of sartorial philosophy against which men can measure themselves . "
the book declares that as taiwan moves toward internationalization , men are constantly required to appear in public places or at social gatherings , so that dressing up is no longer a monopoly of women .
playboys , not chauvinists the rapidity with which ideas and fads spread in a wealthy information society means that a love of beauty is not limited to one gender , and body - sculpting does not distinguish between young and old .
last year , a survey by tung 's foundation discovered that the gender / age cohort most concerned about comparisons between their bodies and others ' is men aged 60 and above .
they ranked higher than women or any other age group of men on " willingness to pay money to preserve or enhance physique " and " attention devoted to changes in physique . " the foundation 's suggested explanation is that these men were focused on their careers when they were younger , and they are only turning their attention to their appearance as they get older .
the new generation , on the other hand , strikes a balance between career and appearance .
this is not necessarily a bad thing .
in the eyes of feminists , the arrival of the era of male preening has added a number of interesting possibilities to the game of mutual admiration between the sexes . but besides lustful appreciation there is a deeper question :
do the " peacocks " who have been influenced in part by feminist consciousness " have any different ideas or make any adjustments with regard to their roles in relations between the sexes ? " not necessarily , it appears . he tu - lin , a staunch advocate of male body autonomy , did an advertisement once for jewelry for men .
beneath the soft face was a body of primitive , raw male muscle , with the idea being that jewelry makes a man even sexier .
the ad copy claimed that jewelry would attract women and make them " willing to accept your rules . " wang hao - wei has asked flashy " pretty boys " how they cope if their girlfriends wo n't listen to them . often the case is , " i give her a good slap in the face . "
despite such anecdotal evidence , however , there are hopes that there will be positives from the new male fashion sense .
ning yin - bin assumes that as men and women compete in corporeal beauty , some balance will be reached , without going to extremes .
lin ching - yun , who has often expressed in writing her conviction that people should n't go for cosmetic surgery unless they have little choice , says that the advantage of men entering the ranks of cosmetic surgery patients is that there is more supervision of the industry ; women who go for plastic surgery accompanied by husbands or boyfriends usually get better results . liu hsiang , who spends a lot of time dressing and making up , has come to feel deeply the trouble women go through in their pursuit of beauty . perhaps , when more men can feel the sentiment that women have known for millennia of " dressing up to please others , " gender relations will be a little more harmonious .
taiwan news holds seminar on cross-strait relations
the biggest story of the year in taiwan has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- victory in the election on 18 march .
jin zhong , president and editor - in - chief of hong kong 's open magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in taiwan observing the election campaign and its aftermath , and on 20 march , open organized a seminar titled " the new president and cross-strait relations . "
the seminar was held in cooperation with taiwan news , one of the island 's oldest english - language newspapers -lrb- known until last year as the china news -rrb- . the kmt ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate james soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than the dpp ticket , a margin of defeat which jin zhong described in his opening remarks as stunning . when chinese communist premier zhu rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before the election in an effort to scare voters away from the dpp ticket , the ruling party made a grievous mistake , opined jin , when it failed to come out strongly critical of zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the " fear card . " at the same time , however , winning candidate chen shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .
as a result , he must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation . he will have to include a wide range of people in his government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people . as for mainland china 's saber - rattling , jin argued that there is no need for undue concern .
stated jin , " the consequences would be too severe . it 's not like taiwan is without any means of retaliation . are the mainland authorities really prepared to see hong kong and shanghai go up in flames ? " there are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course . the seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .
some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy . perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by ruan ming , a visiting professor at tamkang university 's department of china studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former chinese communist secretary general hu yaobang . ruan stated that beijing 's basic position on taiwan has not changed at all since the days of deng xiaoping .
" there 's nothing new in what they 're saying . " the only thing the chinese communists are saying , says ruan , is that they will attack " if taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence , " and taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country 's name would be meaningless .
" no matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you taiwan . it 's just like in england - the official name is the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , but nobody calls it that . and there 's no need to going around shouting , ' we 're a country ! we 're a country ! '
who in the international community does that ? "
pragmatism , please " taiwan needs to be more pragmatic , " says ruan , " just like the mainland . " they made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once the election was over they backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , " we 'll wait and see what they say and do . "
the attitude with them , in ruan 's view , is very pragmatic . ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , " chen shui - bian is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . " he likens chen to the staunchly anti-communist richard nixon , who was able to normalize ties with the chinese communists precisely because he was trusted by the american people .
similarly , when chen shui - bian negotiates with beijing , no one will worry about him selling taiwan down the river .
the noted political commentator chin heng - wei , chief editor of taiwan 's contemporary monthly , agreed strongly with ruan 's comments , and added , " in this election the people of taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations . "
the most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , " black gold " politics -lrb- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -rrb- , and crime fighting . when nobel laureate lee yuan - tseh came out in support of chen shui - bian , implying that the dpp represented " the progressive forces in society , " chen 's support jumped immediately upward .
virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that taiwan need only avoid stirring up chinese nationalism .
wei chengsi -lrb- news director at atv news in hong kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in shanghai -rrb- emphasized the fluid nature of beijing 's policy on taiwan .
he feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than taiwan , and that the current tension basically stems from president lee teng - hui 's pronouncement on state - to - state relations .
having been through the tiananmen massacre , wei felt compelled to warn the people of taiwan , " you absolutely must not think the way the students did in beijing in '89 .
you must not think that ' the communists wo n't attack because the us wo n't let them , ' and then go out of your way to provoke them to where they no longer have an out .
under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for a communist party leader , and he might well decide , ' to hell with the us and economic development , i 've got to attack if i 'm to stay in power . '
that would be an incredible disaster . " chiu hsiang - chung , chief editor of the hong kong economic journal , also advocated cautious optimism .
in his view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but he listed a few variables that bear close watching .
the first is the combination of nationalism and jiang zemin 's desire to serve another term as secretary general of the communist party and make his mark on history . could he attempt to use nationalism to further his ambition ? second , the people 's liberation army hopes to parlay the taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics . third , taiwan could make mistakes and give the chinese communists an excuse for military action .
and a fourth factor is the wishy - washy american support for taiwan . if all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war . when hawk meets hawk
chou chi - ping -lrb- senior advisor at business weekly -rrb- and tseng fu - sheng -lrb- general secretary of the kmt 's department of mainland operations -rrb- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air . chou , as a former official with the straits exchange foundation , has had direct dealings with the chinese communists .
he argued that the dpp 's view of the mainland has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .
it is true , acknowledges chou , that chen shui - bian has changed his basic stance and now says that he " will not change the country 's name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . "
it is also true that lee yuan - tseh -lrb- who is highly respected in the mainland for his academic achievements -rrb- has vouched for the sensibility of chen 's approach to cross-strait relations . and yes , once again , it is true that the chinese communists have muted their rhetoric considerably .
nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .
if the chinese communists conclude that taiwan 's leadership has dropped its insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as its aim , chou argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship . tseng fu - sheng feels that taiwan should claim the high ground by holding up its experience in democratization as an example for the chinese communists . says tseng , " reunification depends entirely on whether china can democratize . "
his biggest worry is that the deep gulf between the dpp and the mainland authorities could cause them to misread each other . he stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between beijing , washington , and taipei . if the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , opined tseng , the result could be war . the seminar attendants also examined taiwan 's domestic situation . versatile author and cultural commentator ping lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the kmt headquarters . in demanding that lee teng - hui resign as chairman of the kmt to take responsibility for the election defeat , ping -lrb- herself a second - generation " mainlander " -rrb- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in taiwanese society .
it was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .
this group feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of kmt rule they have always thought of themselves as a privileged " majority " in taiwan even though in fact they are a minority .
they do not identify with taiwan as their home , and they have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .
in some ways the election has forced them to realize that they truly are a minority . this development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in taiwan . the participants generally felt that the election was a victory for democracy . on the domestic front , the victory of chen shui - bian showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish " black gold " from the political arena . in cross-strait relations chen 's victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between he kmt and the chinese communist party . reform of the kmt and the formation of a new political party by james soong will also improve the political system in taiwan .
it appears that the people of taiwan have finally taken their first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .
everyday people and a story of true grit -- the wu family of taihsi -lrb- laura li / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by david mayer -rrb- they say a rising tide lifts all boats . no one would know more about that than the older generation in taiwan . the changes of the past five decades have had a deep impact , for example , on the wu family of yunlin county .
their main claim to fame is ... nothing , actually , and that is precisely why their story typifies the experiences of so many . so lend your attention , dear reader , as we recount the ups and downs of an average family from a quiet little backwater called taihsi township . wu tsung - sheng and his older sister have come to meet me at the train station in touliu , administrative seat of yunlin county . we pile into a car and head toward their parents ' home .
wu tsung - sheng fills me in on his hometown . " taihsi is a rather unusual place , " says tsung - sheng , the family 's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at tunghai university in taichung .
" when i read the studies that describe taiwan as being so prosperous , i have to wonder how their descriptions could be so totally different from what our lives have been . they might as well be talking about a different planet . " probably most people do n't realize , adds tsung - sheng , that there are still places in taiwan as backward as taihsi .
to the outsider , however , the place does n't look backward at all .
as tsung - sheng drives west in a very nice toyota at a comfortable speed down a broad county highway , his older sister sits in the front passenger seat with cell phone in hand discussing the traffic situation with someone at home .
in the meantime , tsung - sheng 's five - year - old nephew clamors from the back seat for his mother to buy him a pokemon plaything , just like kids the world over are doing these days .
when mcdonald 's stores in taiwan were swamped last year during a giveaway of hello kitty dolls , lots of people thought they might be able to beat the crowds by hitting mcdonald 's in supposedly untrendy taihsi , but they found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations .
the emperor is far away the scenery grows increasingly rural as we move west through the townships of huwei , tuku , paochung , and tungshih . temples tower over green rice fields . less than half an hour after leaving the train station we get off the county highway and onto narrow tungshih east road .
when we reach our destination in rural taihsi township , a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road , and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one .
wu tsung - sheng 's parents , who are pushing 60 years old , run a local bakery , and they greet us with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of haikou -lrb- as the locals are accustomed to calling taihsi and the surrounding townships near the coast in western yunlin county -rrb- .
they also speak taiwanese with an unmistakable haikou accent . to welcome their guest they have ordered a big seafood meal in advance . tsung - sheng 's grandmother , parents , uncles , aunts , cousins , nephews , and nieces have all come in from around haikou for the gathering .
the strength of the wu clan 's family ties is plainly evident . these people go back for generations here .
from the destruction of world war ii to the mixed joy and grief of the early post-war years , from the barest of rural hamlets to a prosperous little town , this family has seen it all .
84 - year - old grandma wu is not as sharp as she used to be , but she can still rattle off a tale or two . two indignities suffered back in the 1940s , in particular , remain indelibly etched in her memory . the first occurred in the latter part of world war ii when the japanese tied her hands behind her back and marched her off to do forced labor for over a year , building roads , digging ditches , and carrying a shoulder pole . the second indignity was the onerous taxes that were levied in the early years after taiwan returned to chinese rule .
" we had to pay taxes twice a year , " says grandma wu , flashing a mouthful of dental work .
" the first time was for water , and the second was for land . it did n't matter whether you even had a crop to harvest or not - you had to pay , or they 'd throw you in jail . "
she explains that one dou -lrb- 10 liters -rrb- of rice back in the 1940s was worth five or six yuan , or about four days ' pay for a manual laborer , but the tax on one jia of land -lrb- 0.97 hectares -rrb- was 150 yuan . a lot of people had to borrow money just to pay their taxes .
" it took four days to earn one dou of rice , " says grandma wu . " we could n't afford to eat it , because we needed it to pay our taxes . "
although the kuomintang government eventually carried out land reform to provide relief for poor farmers , the wu family never shared in the benefits . they were as poor as their neighbors , to be sure , but they owned land and were thus classified as small landowners , which by definition meant that they neither had any extra land to rent out nor did they rent from others . while many of their neighbors received land as a result of the reforms , the wu family got nothing .
grandma wu was close to 30 years old when the kuomintang recovered taiwan from japan , but the event meant little to her , for she had never received any schooling .
all she remembers is that when the war ended , taiwan was turned over to " them . " with a grin , grandma wu throws up her hands in a gesture of helplessness and quips , " when the colonial government spoke , i did n't understand their japanese .
when the kuomintang speaks , i do n't understand their mandarin either . " " there 's no difference between the japanese government and the kuomintang , " says grandma wu .
" if something important comes up , they send a local official out to make an announcement and explain what it 's all about . " wu tsung - sheng adds , " they 're totally outside the loop here . you of course know the phrase , ' heaven is high and the emperor is far away . ' well , it was people like my grandmother who coined it . "
grandma wu was adopted into the wu family at age ten .
within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out .
orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .
with no male siblings to carry on the family line , at age 25 she managed to find a husband who was willing to let his first male child take the wu surname .
the children came rapidly , and there was never any money to spare . but it is clear that she does live reasonably well now . when did survival cease to be such a struggle ?
grandma wu remembers quite clearly when the turning point came . it was in the early 1980s , when her oldest grandchild was already a teenager , that business gradually started going better for her three sons . the three brothers got together and decided that they should each give her nt$ 2,000 every month .
for the first time in her life , she was able to relax a bit , then five years ago the government started providing a monthly pension of nt$ 3,000 .
this was enough to cover meals , and her life improved even more . grandma wu now lives together with several other old folks very near the coast in the old traditional farmhouse where she grew up . her main worry these days is her granddaughter in taipei , who is in her 30s and still unmarried .
" her father got married when he was 22 . how can a girl be putting things off ? " 13 - year - old construction worker
a lot of hard work has gone into the comfortable life grandma wu enjoys today .
her eldest son wu chien - lo recounts that after he graduated from sixth grade in 1954 his family was too poor to let him go any further in school , so at age 13 he took off with an older boy on the slow train for taipei .
without pausing to take in the sights of the big city , chien - lo went straight to work at a construction site , where he carried a shoulder pole and mixed cement .
buildings were going up everywhere in taipei in the mid-1950s , and the city was bursting with opportunities .
but , says chien - lo , " i only had a grade - school education . i did n't have what it took to think about a career in taipei . i just wanted to go back and help my family work the fields . "
after two years in taipei he went back home just as the area was getting electric power for the first time .
the bright lights at night got some people so excited at first that they could n't get to sleep . taiwan back then was one of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane , but the harvest was extremely difficult work , as chien - lo is painfully aware .
once he came very close to cutting a finger clean off with a sickle , but he just slapped some cement mix -lrb- commonly regarded as a good disinfectant -rrb- on the wound and worked on through the pain .
united we stand wu chien - lo joined the army at age 20 , and during his stint he made friends with someone who had been making a living as a baker . chien - lo began to realize that selling his manual labor was not a viable long - term option . he decided to open a bakery .
after receiving his discharge he borrowed nt$ 12,000 from his father , hired a baker , and opened up a store . he himself rode around on a motorcycle all day selling beverages and baked goods .
his capital ran out before he expected , and he had to ask for a second loan from his father - in - law to get his business off the ground .
a few years later his younger brother tsai jui - ting -lrb- as the second son , he was given his father 's surname -rrb- got married and followed in wu chien - lo 's footsteps by selling baked goods and beverages . to avoid competing with his brother , jui - ting opened up his store over ten kilometers north in mailiao township .
jui - ting , who in his youth always wore hand - me - downs and crude garments fashioned from throwaway rice sacks and the like , never put on his own set of store - bought clothes until just prior to joining the army . who would have guessed he would one day become the biggest beverage wholesaler in the mailiao area ?
having watched his older brothers succeed with their bakery businesses , the youngest brother tsai kuo - lung took up the same business in the neighboring township of szuhu after finishing his military service . the three brothers have worked together over the years to build up their businesses , and an efficient division of labor has evolved among them .
kuo - lung today is in charge of doing all the baking , and he acts as supplier for wu chien - lo and tsai jui - ting .
" in a rural area like this , " says wu chien - lo , " family members work together , and everybody shares equally in the success . "
not surprisingly , of course , he has seen quarrels arise in other families over who does the most work and who goofs off , who 's getting rich and who 's not , but in the wu family , at least , harmony has been the key to success .
all three brothers are hard - working and frugal . each one married through a matchmaker , and none of them ever had an album of wedding photos made . asks tsai kuo - lung , " why should we work so hard and pinch pennies all the time just to spend our money on something like that ? "
all three brothers drive toyota camrys , purchased from the same dealer .
one can gradually save up money by running a small business , to be sure , but wu chien - lo states frankly , " land is where the real money is . it 's hard to get by just running a business . "
because his beverage wholesaling business requires a lot of space for large warehouses , he borrowed money from friends for many years to buy land .
little did he know when he first started that what he bought 30 years ago would go up in price from nt$ 3,000 per ping -lrb- approximately 3.3 square meters -rrb- to over nt$ 100,000 today . when you throw in the family farmland , which has not yet been divided among the brothers , the wu clan is worth over nt$ 100 million .
says wu chien - lo , " who figured prices would go up like they have ? we did n't buy the land as an investment . we 're not greedy enough to even think in those terms . we just bought it because we needed it for our business . "
sacrificing for the kids
although they may be loath to spend frivolously on themselves , wu chien - lo and his wife consider money no object when it comes to their children 's education .
" the reason we worked so hard around the clock for so many years was because we were afraid that we might not be able to do right by our kids . we were worried that they might fall in with the wrong crowd after they got into junior high , " says mrs. wu , adding that taihsi is well known for the fact that it has " lots of dust in the air , lots of yams , and lots of gangsters . "
to keep their kids out of trouble they sent all four of them off to a well - known catholic boarding school in touliu as soon as they reached junior high . each child spent six years there -lrb- except for the second daughter , who only attended for three years -rrb- , and every weekend the two parents would pack up lots of goodies and take the bus to see their kids . it was a difficult trip , and required several transfers .
the total cost of one year 's tuition plus room and board at the private school came to more than nt$ 150,000 per child . with four kids at the school , the financial burden was substantial , especially considering the fact that they were spending these sums back in the mid-1980s . the struggle to pay tuition took every ounce of energy they had .
" that 's the responsibility you bear as a parent . you want to see your children succeed , " says wu chien - lo . luckily , all four of his children were good students and had no problem passing their university entrance examinations . in their little hometown , wu tsung - sheng and his siblings are noted for their excellent academic achievements .
the result has been a bit comical in at least one respect , for the eldest daughter was so strictly observant of the prohibition against speaking taiwanese in school -lrb- a rule formerly enforced throughout taiwan -rrb- that she does n't even speak taiwanese very well any more .
after graduating from national taiwan normal university in taipei , she came back to yunlin county several years ago to teach senior high school in touliu , and now she makes people laugh every time she opens her mouth to speak her odd brand of taiwanese . it makes for an amusing contrast with her grandmother , who does n't speak mandarin well at all .
in the view of wu tsung - sheng , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put on education does n't have so much to do with the idea of getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .
his parents are not interested in his specialty , nor do they know anything about it , but they have never objected to his chosen path , nor did they say a word when his younger brother switched his major from business management to sociology . this long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able to make a living near home -lrb- because there are no major universities or research institutions in yunlin county -rrb- .
" thinking back on it , i realize that our parents began encouraging us very early to aim high and not feel like we had to stay near home .
we all started boarding school at age twelve and then went on to university in taipei . as we got older , we went back home less and less . "
their studies ended up weakening their ties to their hometown , notes tsung - sheng wistfully . their parents , in the meantime , are doing everything they can to make it easier for the children to come back home if necessary . for starters , they 've built a multi-story house with a separate floor set aside for each of the children .
chien - lo explains , " our two boys have n't started working or gotten married yet .
i hope they 'll be able to make a go of it off in some city , but if it does n't work out they can always come back and tend the store . " it would probably make better business sense , in fact , to close the store .
people have been moving away from the haikou area for many years , and the local economy is in the doldrums .
what 's more , it will only get more and more difficult to make money running an old - fashioned mom and pop store now that a new convenience store has opened up across the street .
even so , the couple is n't yet ready to call it quits . it is for their children 's sake that they stay in business . living next to heavy industry
less than ten kilometers away in mailiao stands the formosa plastic group 's sixth naphtha cracker complex . tsai jui - ting points out that even though formosa plastics uses a lot of foreign laborers from southeast asia , the complex has also hired a lot of local people , and since the plant went into operation he does n't seem to see so many young people hanging out in the area 's small towns with nothing to do .
even though the seawall built to protect the plant has blocked people 's view of the sea , and in spite of worries about the possibility of mercury pollution in the soil , the extra employment has won the plant a lot of local support .
says wu chien - lo , " i always say , if you 've got work , you 've got food on the table . do n't go around complaining about the pay being too low . it used to take four days to earn one dou of rice . now you can earn over ten dou in just one day .
if that 's not enough for you , then you might as well go starve to death . " wu chien - lo and his younger brothers do n't expect a lot from the government .
at most , they express nostalgia for the days when former general hau pei - tsun served as premier , because " they arrested a lot of criminals when he was in charge . "
the one thing that really irks them now is national health insurance . " when you run your own business like we do , " says youngest brother tsai kuo - lung , " a family of five like ours has to pay over nt$ 60,000 per year in premiums for national health insurance . that 's a lot more expensive than labor insurance or farmer 's insurance .
what 's more , he adds , there are no major hospitals in yunlin county , so if you get sick you 've got to go all the way to the next county .
not only that , says tsai , the deductible for medicine was jacked up " ridiculously high " last year , and everyone is complaining bitterly about it .
hoping for more democracy when the subject turns to politics and taiwan independence , the normally outspoken wu chien - lo suddenly grows cautious . " it does n't matter who wins the election .
they 're all good candidates . we 'll just have to wait and see . " wu tsung - sheng understands the reasons for his father 's reticence quite well . yunlin county politics are riddled with factionalism and the influence of organized crime , and you can find ample proof here that all politics are indeed local . with over 40 voters in the extended family , the wu clan is a plum of a voting block . all the local factions eagerly woo chien - lo , who has in the past gotten deeply involved in politics and taken to the streets in support of certain candidates .
over the years , however , he has learned that it is best to avoid offending people , and he now plays his cards close to the vest .
wu tsung - sheng explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked only tenuously to what goes on in distant taipei , and the concept of democracy has n't made much headway here .
the locals are most concerned about what public figure " gives people face " by showing up at weddings and funerals , and who has close personal ties with whom .
what is more , vote buying is accepted with breezy indifference , as if it were the normal thing to do . however , says tsung - sheng , local politics probably wo n't be so dirty once the younger generation becomes more influential . fifty years of struggle have brought prosperity to our island . will it take another fifty years to establish a mature democracy ?
as tsung - sheng drives down the road , holding forth on politics and society , i ca n't help feeling all of a sudden that there is every reason to be very confident about the future of taiwan . p. 99 84 - year - old grandma wu puts an arm around her great - grandson and great - granddaughter . from right to left are her sons wu chien - lo -lrb- and his wife -rrb- , tsai jui - ting , and tsai kuo - lung . throw in the grandchildren and you 've got four generations gathered at grandma wu 's traditional farmhouse right near the seacoast in taihsi township . p. 100 the wu family 's bakery business has been a steady money earner over the years and has provided a comfortable living . wu tsung - sheng and his parents are shown here in front of wu chien - lo 's shop . p. 101 4 - h clubs were once very popular in taiwan . the girl at second from the right in the front is today the wife of wu chien - lo . -lrb- courtesy of wu chien - lo -rrb- p. 102 the haikou area is known for lots of sandy wind blowing in from the seashore , and for the big yam crop grown here . the area is also a big producer of oysters . the empty shells piled here along the roadside fill the air with their briny aroma . p. 103 not a whole lot of traffic moves along the streets of taihsi township . the slow - paced small town atmosphere lingers in the mind long after a visit to taihsi has ended . p. 104 eldest grandson wu tsung - sheng is working on a doctorate in sociology . this visit has spurred grandma wu to tell lots of stories he 's never heard before , and he takes a close interest in her tales .
" at the end of rainbows " looking for palauan pots of gold
" from taiwan 's point of view , palau is like a freshly opened oyster , when you first see the shining pearl . "
so declares gennie yen , the director of the roc office of the palau visitors authority .
to be sure , since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the roc and palau last december 29 , the island has received considerable media attention in taiwan . the number of taiwan visitors to palau in january was double the number of last january . in march , foreign minister chen chien - jen led a delegation to palau which included government officials , private sector business people , and representatives of the mass media . and in april , the taipei office of the palau visitors authority formally opened its doors .
this " palau fever " has also infected taiwan business people , who are always " susceptible " to new opportunities . building on the foundation of formal diplomatic relations , many taiwanese firms are anxious to try their hand and to explore palau 's investment environment .
a guidebook describes this beautiful archipelago nation in the south pacific as being " at the end of rainbows . "
though this may seem far , far away , in fact , palau is geographically the closest to taiwan of all the countries with which the roc has formal diplomatic ties .
a direct flight takes only three - and - a - half hours .
perhaps for taiwanese , there are rather more immediate implications to " the end of rainbows . "
this unfamiliar and exotic land is a virgin territory of commercial opportunities for tourism , trade and investment . jewels in the pacific taiwan and palau share much more in common in terms of culture and historical position than most people realize .
the people of palau are of the same ethnic background as the aboriginal people of taiwan - malayo - polynesian . last year when the inaugural polynesian cultural festival was held in taitung county , scholars and arts troupes from palau were among the participants .
during the modern age of western and japanese colonialism , both taiwan and palau experienced foreign rule which has left traces of spanish , japanese , american , and other cultures .
after wwii , taiwan was returned to chinese rule , while palau became a un trust territory under us authority . -lrb- palau did not gain full independence until 1994 . -rrb- palau - taiwan political contacts began in the 1980s .
in 1983 , president haruo i. remeliik led the first palauan delegation to taiwan . there have been numerous official visits since then . in 1984 , the two countries signed an agricultural cooperation agreement , and taiwan dispatched a technical assistance team there .
since the beginning of exchanges between the two governments , taiwanese business people have been conducting trade with palau , and have also invested there , entering the restaurant , fishing , retail , and other trades .
during the taiwan strait missile crises in 1995 and 1996 , when rumors and panic filled the air , fraudulent business groups in taiwan cheated many investors with a scam surrounding real estate in palau , but there was a silver lining to this cloud : it attracted the attention of more taiwan business people , and especially the domestic tourism industry , to business opportunities in palau . bin - fang stone , now director of the palau - roc friendship association , was one of those who came to palau at that time to explore the possibility of investment in real estate .
stone states : " before independence , there was a serious lack of tourist facilities in palau . most of the visitors were in specially - organized groups from the us or japan which came for deep sea fishing or scuba diving . it was only when taiwan tourist agencies began developing the tourist route to palau that many taiwanese began to invest in the tourism industry here . " snorkeling , one of the most popular activities in palau , was brought in by taiwanese entrepreneurs , and you could say that they have been among the founders of the palauan tourism industry .
currently there are more than 100 taiwanese living in palau . most of them are in the tourism industry , in operations such as tourist agencies , hotels , and water sports . though most of the investments are small , there are large projects , including the hotel palau , opened in 1998 and built by the kuomintang - run acc corporation development company , as well as a large vacation spa currently being built by the hung kuo group . in addition , taiwan businessman chen liang - shen made a major investment by purchasing outright a local hotel .
zero pollution many taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in palau .
the foreign ministry delegation that visited palau in march included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment . taiwanese entrepreneurs already in palau enthusiastically welcomed the establishment of an embassy there , which makes the future of their investments even more secure . lin neng - jong , director - general of the industrial development and investment center of the ministry of economic affairs , who visited the island in march , points to some special concerns in the palau investment environment : for one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development .
moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and - except for fishing products - other materials all have to be imported .
therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . in addition , the total population is only 18,000 . anyone interested in establishing a factory there will face a labor shortage . in fact , palau relies on " imports " for most of its labor as well , and there are 6000 foreign workers in the country . lin concludes : " tourism is still the best investment in palau right now . "
early taiwanese investors have certainly been proved perspicacious , since palau 's pollution - free environment is its greatest asset . diving aficionados have hailed palau as the greatest of the seven wonders of the deep .
its waters support more than 700 varieties of coral and 1500 varieties of fish . the ocean water is warm and the currents are moderate , making for ideal diving conditions . in addition , there is a great deal of shallow water , which is tailor - made for snorkeling , so that even tourists who are not particularly at home in the water can enjoy the magnificence of the ocean . especially noteworthy is " blue corner , " one of the most famous snorkeling locations in the world .
and it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; palau 's land scenery is also absorbing . the " rock islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .
the islands of peleliu and anguar , which were battlefields in the pacific war between the us and japan , are criss - crossed by tunnels built by the japanese , while the remains of ships and aircraft dot the ocean floor . these islands have great potential as sites for historical tourism .
in the air , because palau is a tropical ocean climate , and rains leave as fast as they come , tourists are often treated to rainbows .
gennie yen , the director of the taiwan office of the palau visitors authority , says that people have even seen three rainbows at one time .
and if there has been no rain , you can see a kind of horizontal rainbow by standing on the beach at sunset and following with your eyes the different shades of blue of the receding ocean as they merge into the bands of reds in the evening sky .
in these islands surrounded by coral , which are virtually always calm and windless , you can be pulled into the sky under a parasailer , and have a whiff of what the scent of heaven must be like .
in addition , the bia -lrb- traditional structures where men met to socialize and discuss local affairs -rrb- , and also the local species of non-poisonous jellyfish , are other items that are especially interesting to tourists .
reinvigorating the tourism market
lin neng - jong says there are two viable directions to get into the palau tourism industry . one is to invest in a tourism - related industry in palau , the other is to increase the number of taiwan tourists and extend profit opportunities into taiwan itself .
oddly , despite palau 's beauty , in the past few years tourism has dropped off considerably .
in 1997 , there were more than 70,000 foreign visits to palau . last year the figure was 50,000 . taiwan has been , along with japan , one of the main sources of tourists to palau .
in 1997 , the number of taiwanese visitors peaked at more than 30,000 annually , but now is down to well below 20,000 . as a result , taiwan tourism businesses in palau , which mainly cater to taiwanese , are crying uncle .
" it 's not only the hotel industry , even at chinese restaurants business has fallen off sharply , " says chu hui - chun . chu , who also operates a tourist agency , was forced to move the chinese restaurant she had run for many years to much smaller premises .
hsu wen - sheng , deputy director - general of the roc tourism bureau , says that a major reason why profit margins have shrunk is that tour operators in taiwan no longer aggressively push palau as a destination .
hsu notes that far east airlines , which operates the taiwan - to - palau route , raised the price of a ticket by over nt$ 3000 two years ago , citing inadequate passenger demand and high costs . this made palau much less competitive compared to other places such as guam , bali , and phuket .
hsu concludes : " if the price is raised for tour groups , no one is interested , but if the original price is maintained , the tour operators ' profit falls too low .
a lot of tourist agencies have simply given up promoting this route . " james yeh , general manager of the sunrise express travel service , which specializes in pacific island tours , says that the current trend among travelers in taiwan is for low group fares with lots of entertainment provided .
most people who go on island vacations are looking for pure recreation , so they would prefer to be somewhere where the facilities are more developed .
though palau is rich in natural attractions , it lacks peripheral tourist facilities like pubs , shopping centers , and gift shops , so naturally the islands are less attractive .
despite all this , james yeh notes that the rate of return visitors to palau is very high , more than 30 % . clearly the island is still very appealing . if the problems of high group rates and inadequate facilities can be solved , there is enormous potential yet in palau .
the palauan government is working hard to eliminate obstacles to solving the above problems . johnny itaru kishigawa , director of the palau visitors authority , says that the government is going forward on a new airport and a number of tourist - related facilities . they are also studying a proposal from the taiwan side to lower landing fees and reduce underlying ticket costs . in addition , the pva now has a taiwan office , and hopes to raise palau 's profile among taiwan travellers .
gone fishin'
in the current wave of interest in investment in palau , the fisheries industry is also getting attention .
currently , there 's only one taiwanese business person in the fishing industry in palau - tai jung - fei - so profits are quite good .
" at first i was in business with a bunch of friends , and we rented eight fishing boats , but profits were only ordinary . after my friends pulled out of the operation , i switched over to mainly running a base for fishing boats . " little did he expect that profits would be much larger , especially after the company acquired local fishing rights for 75 years . during the peak season from may to october , more than ten tuna ships come in every day to offload their catch and to resupply .
these days , tai 's palau marine industries covers an area of 1.5 acres and employs more than 40 staff . it offers advanced freezing facilities and two aircraft , guaranteeing to deliver tuna fresh to the japanese market within 24 hours .
however , though tai has made quite a name for himself with his business , this does not necessarily mean that other taiwanese can come and make similar investments .
koo kuang - ming , chairman of koo 's holdings company ltd. , which operates fishing boats in the south pacific , explains that south pacific fishing is divided into two types - net fishing , and line fishing of tuna . palau is not really suited to the former , because its territorial waters are not large , so the catch is limited .
on the other hand , tuna stocks there are high , so palau is more suited to line fishing . but the problem is that tai jung - fei is already running a tuna base there , and it is debatable whether there is the need for another one . koo warns : " it 's hard to estimate the potential catch . if there were several firms , the risk would be much greater . "
in addition , though there are many varieties of fish around palau , the scale of operations is small , and markets are far away , so the return on investment would not necessarily be very high .
koo points instead to a different option : the waters around palau are clear and warm , which makes them suited to aquaculture . so far , returns from the small - scale aquaculture of scallops have been decent . koo cautions , however , that " if you want to invest , you have to go large - scale , because after all palau is far from the main markets . "
palau free trade zone
in 1986 , palau , like many former american - controlled trust territories , signed a " compact of free association " with the us . the agreement allows palauan products to enter the states tax - free , and there are no quota limits for such things as textiles . for taiwan , a major producer of textiles and electronics , this is a very strong investment incentive .
currently japanese and taiwanese business people are negotiating with the palauan government to establish a palau free trade zone . the idea is for palau to designate a special zone for economic development , with the palau government providing tax and land - use incentives .
the zone would be for processing of exports , mainly in textiles and electronics , and mainly to the us market .
felix yen , president of the zhen an palau corporation , which is handling the hung kuo project , is very familiar with the business climate in palau .
he says that right now the main obstacles to foreign investment are land acquisition and communications . under palauan law foreigners are not allowed to own land there , but can only lease land for development . the longest permitted lease is 50 years . but even leasing is a complicated matter , because traditionally land in palau is owned jointly by the family and the clan .
moreover , communications and internet access are not very reliable . all of these problems deter investors . though the communications problems may be resolved within a few years - the government has received us assistance for priority construction of electricity and fiber optic facilities - lin neng - jong still cautions those interested in signing on to the free trade zone plan to " be prudent . "
" the point to watch out for in the whole plan is that taiwan firms may not understand that it might not be all that good a deal from the point of view of the palau authorities , " he says . currently foreign firms are more pro-active than the palauan government , which has its own concerns : the indigenous population is small , and there could be social problems if a large number of foreign workers come to the islands . also , the government must weigh economic development against environmental destruction . " the terms under which palau would accept the proposed zone may not be as good as many taiwan business people optimistically expect . "
looking at the larger picture , however , there are many areas and ways to invest . a careful look will show that palau has many pearls .
li mao - tsung , a pottery expert living in the us , who was commissioned by the roc government to do a study of the suitability of palauan clays for pottery , says that palau has a lot of clay of decent quality , making the islands a good location for the development of art pottery or large scale pottery and porcelain production .
unique investment opportunities like these are waiting to be taken up by alert entrepreneurs . perhaps palau is , as gennie yen says , like a just - opened oyster , with the pearl gleaming before your eyes . but to grasp the pearl , taiwan business people will have to rely on their wisdom and experience .
constitutional revision paves way for phasing out national assembly -lrb- chang ching - ju / tr. by david j. toman -rrb-
on april 24 the national assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during lee teng - hui 's presidency : its own demobilization . while this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting national assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .
on march 24 , just days after the roc presidential election , the council of grand justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's national assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void .
this stirred the ire of national assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . " the reaction by a minority of na delegates to the grand justices ' constitutional interpretation once again triggered displeasure in society at the body 's refusal to admit its fallibility .
activists in groups such as the taipei society and the association of taiwanese university professors organized a street demonstration to call for the dissolution of the national assembly . a further consequence of the grand justices ' ruling was that an election would have to be held to produce a new national assembly membership before the conclusion of the current term . while this development had would - be candidates in all parties scrambling to launch election campaigns , by late march the post-presidential-election situation , combined with pressure from public opinion , pushed the kmt to work with the dpp on means to phase out the national assembly , despite the kmt 's previous opposition to the body 's complete dissolution in the name of preserving the constitutional structure .
for a time , the question of whether to hold elections for the national assembly , as well as the dpp and kmt 's shared policy for phasing out the body , were viewed as motivated by fear of the growth of the people first party -lrb- pfp -rrb- . thus the hubbub continued over the fate of the national assembly for a fortnight , until finally the newly formed pfp caucus in the assembly agreed to its gradual downsizing . this paved the way for the commencement on april 8 of the sixth round of constitutional revisions in recent years , in which such issues as reducing the total number of na delegates and freezing their powers and duties - amounting to their " self - abolition " - became the center of discussion .
the various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the national assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates . finally , on april 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the national assembly , favorable provisions for residents of taiwan 's offshore islands -lrb- kinmen , matsu , and penghu -rrb- and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .
in line with these revisions , the voting public will no longer directly elect na delegates . rather , the national assembly will become a " task - based body " generated according to proportional political party representation in the legislature , maintaining the rights to ratification of constitutional revisions proposed by the legislative yuan , impeachment of the president and vice president , and resolutions on modifications to national territory .
with these changes , legislators will exercise approval over personnel appointments to the judicial , examination and control yuans . to be fair , the national assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition .
this is especially notable given the ambiguity of taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two - headed system in the true sense .
many scholars caution that eliminating the national assembly and handing all its powers to the legislative yuan , while the government structure remains ambiguous , is not the best structural framework .
that said , despite landmark changes such as the full election of the national parliament in taiwan and establishment of the legal groundwork for the direct election of the roc president , the roc constitution has been revamped with alarming frequency over the past few years . in fact , some have scoffed that the constitution , the basis upon which the nation 's laws are founded , has been tinkered with more often than the civil and criminal codes .
further , new duties and authorities were given to the national assembly in order to achieve successive constitutional revisions .
for instance , in exchange for the assembly agreeing to give up its authority to elect the president , the body was given power of approval over personnel appointments to the judicial yuan , examination yuan , and control yuan .
with each revision , the constitution became increasingly jumbled , while na delegates leveraged their positions to exact " constitutional amendment rent " and fatten themselves up .
last year 's term extension bill further solidified the public 's image of the national assembly as no more than a tool of political struggle , and a self - indulgent body at that , generating widespread consensus on the necessity of dissolving it . while the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire across the political spectrum to progressively dismantle the national assembly , sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure of the various political parties to propose a new blueprint in its place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in the roc . for example , the national assembly will become a " task - based body " generated according to the proportion of seats held by each political party in the legislature . national taiwan university professor lee hung - hsi , an expert on constitutional law , points out that less than 10 % of the taiwanese population takes part in political party activities . thus a national assembly generated proportionally according to party representation represents suppression of the views of the other 90 % of the population , and thus violates the principle of vesting authority over constitutional government in the people . following the demobilization of the national assembly , many functions and powers currently held by the national assembly will be transferred to the legislative yuan . this in turn raises fears in the academic community that the legislative yuan could become an untamable new constitutional monster .
the expanded powers of the legislative yuan also include the impeachment and recall of the president and vice president , and the supplementary election of the vice president . these changes tighten the relationship between the parliament and the president , requiring the president to report to the legislative yuan on the state of the nation . but the president has only the passive authority to dissolve the parliament . in the face of a parliament with supreme powers , a president whose party claims only a minority in the legislature is powerless even to replace a premier with whom he does not see eye to eye , leaving him devoid of the authorities and responsibilities to correspond with his administrative actions . a china times editorial urged that the question of whether the enormous legislative yuan might be split into two houses by function be evaluated and worked out as soon as possible . the legal demobilization of the national assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . this dire outlook is surely not something taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the national assembly .
minister of transportation and communications yeh chu - lan -lrb- chang ching - ju / tr. david j. toman -rrb- -lrb- photo by pu hua - chih -rrb-
raised in a hakka village in miaoli county , yeh chu - lan , a graduate of the law department at fu - jen catholic university , is the new minister of transportation and communications , overseeing 120,000 employees and an annual budget of over nt$ 400 billion .
from her early career in advertising , to taking up her late husband 's unfulfilled wishes and setting out on the road of political no - return , yeh chu - lan has fought impressively , earning wide acclaim .
what makes yeh , having tasted the sweetness and sorrow of life in equal portions , able to switch roles with such aplomb ?
and where does the soft - spoken yet resolute yeh find the strength to handle the mounting challenges that life has thrust upon her ?
if not for the self - immolation of her late husband , cheng nan - jung , yeh would not have gotten involved in politics .
since running for legislator in 1989 , yeh chu - lan 's approach to politics for over a decade has been to " do things for taiwan . "
with the election of chen shui - bian to the presidency , she says she feels that the dpp 's transitional mission has been accomplished . however , at the repeated invitation of both president chen and premier tang fei to " write history for taiwanese democracy , " yeh was moved by their sense of mission and accepted the appointment as new minister of transportation and communications .
delicate and soft on the outside , strong and tough on the inside , yeh chu - lan 's confidence and tenacity are well illustrated by her love story .
after commencing university at the age of 18 , she met fellow philosophy student cheng nan - jung . her family 's eldest girl , she disregarded her father 's objections and insisted on marrying cheng .
for a short period after graduating from university she returned to teach in miaoli , but in order to be together with cheng nan - jung she returned north to look for work in taipei .
starting in an advertising agency as an account assistant , she climbed straight up the ranks to become the highest - ranking female executive in taiwan 's advertising industry , impressing colleagues with her competence and talents .
far more than a pinch - hitter
from career woman to professional legislator , yeh 's metamorphosis was clear for her colleagues to see .
in " looking back , " a documentary on women in taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the dpp 's department of women 's affairs , the late dpp women 's affairs director peng wan - ju made an acute observation about yeh : although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .
peng commented : " during her first term as a legislator she acted a lot like a substitute , so every time she questioned officials or addressed a session she would say that such and such was communicated to her in a dream by cheng nan - jung . however , by her second and third terms , she came very much into her own , and she won great respect from women 's groups as a defender of women 's interests and a champion of the family dependents ' section of the civil law . "
at the recent yangmingshan seminar for new government officials , yeh chu - lan gave a short interview , stressing , " when i first ran for office i was not playing the role of a housewife pinch - hitting for her husband . i was already an influential female executive in my professional field .
and even though i went into politics due to my husband 's sacrifice , i was only willing to do so because i shared his beliefs . my objective was to fight as a mother for what i hold dearest .
as a public servant , i have always been my own person . " in over a decade in politics , yeh chu - lan 's exhaustive efforts on the part of women 's groups are worth tallying .
the revision of the family dependents ' section of the civil law was a major undertaking , with a mind - boggling number of legal provisions touching on highly complex issues .
long - term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of yeh and new party legislator hsieh chi - ta , ultimately built momentum in the legislative yuan .
finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the executive yuan , the legislative yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . this proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law . respect for expertise
variously described by the media as a crusader for justice , a hard worker and an incorruptible political figure , yeh chu - lan , known as " mother of the country , " carries considerable seniority within the dpp . her aggressive efforts to shore up the hakka vote for chen shui - bian during the presidential election were also crucial to her appointment as minister of transportation and communications .
on the other hand , the media also notes that yeh has practically no past connections to the ministry of transportation and communications , and the ministry 's complex , specialized tasks present her with a steep learning curve . addressing these issues , yeh relates , " the ministry of transportation and communications , in a word , is about ' people , ' making it essentially a huge service network . with this in mind , setting out from the standpoint of ' people ' is the first task i have set out for myself . "
in addition , she stresses that due to the excessive burdens of the old administration , in which policies were constantly distorted by personal interests and party considerations , perhaps professionals in the ministry of transportation and communications were frustrated at being unable to put their expertise into play . " people want the new government to quell the old never - ending conflicts over individual interests , and draw a line between public administration and politics . these are the biggest issues faced by the new cabinet . now is the chance to clear out the cobwebs and get off to a new start . "
new president takes office on may 20 -lrb- eric lin / tr. by david mayer -rrb-
the republic of china 's tenth - term president and vice president , chen shui - bian and annette lu , took the oath of office on 20 may , 2000 in the first - ever transfer of power in chinese history to a popularly elected leader from the opposition .
in his inaugural speech , chen touched on a wide range of issues of concern to voters in taiwan . on the domestic front , he discussed the alternation of political parties in power , democratic reforms , a fair and just society , a government for all the people , nonpartisan government by a coalition of forces opposed to corruption , the establishment of an efficient and dynamic government , a knowledge - based economy , law and order , environmental preservation , education , culture , reconstruction from last year 's september 21st earthquake , and various other issues . the common thread running through his domestic policy remarks was an emphasis on reform .
on the sensitive topic of cross-strait relations , he sent a number of positive signals to beijing .
the speech put a heavy stress on democracy and human rights , a reflection of the high expectations the public holds for the government on these fronts . later in the day , post-inaugural celebrations kicked off around the island and commentary on chen shui - bian 's address came pouring in from across the political spectrum .
what was the overseas reaction ?
what did domestic commentators have to say ?
how will chen 's presidency change taiwan ?
the new president 's inaugural ceremony began at 9:00 am on 20 may at the presidential palace . chen shui - bian and annette lu were sworn in by weng yueh - sheng , president of the judicial yuan , then legislative yuan speaker wang jin - pyng presented chen with the official seal of the republic of china and three other presidential seals .
chen took his first act as president by signing his name to the appointments of tang fei as premier , chang chun - hsiung as secretary - general of the office of the president , and chuang ming - yao as secretary - general of the national security council .
after tang took his oath , he submitted his cabinet nominations to chen for formal appointment .
the most remarkable moment of the inauguration came at 11:00 am when chen strolled into the open air to take the oath of office and deliver his inaugural address to the nation in front of the presidential palace .
featuring aboriginal folk songs and a rendition of the roc national anthem by pop queen chang hui - mei , the ceremony was attended by over 10,000 foreign guests , overseas chinese , and local citizens .
after the national anthem , chen shui - bian delivered his much anticipated inaugural address . observers at home and around the world were waiting and wondering - would he address the " one china " issue ?
in his 40 - minute speech , chen declared the determination of the people of taiwan to carry out a peaceful transfer of power between political parties , and to continue forward with their democratic political system . he called for a government for all the people and a non-partisan coalition of the forces opposed to corruption , and declared the new government 's determination to improve law and order , the economy , the environment , post-earthquake reconstruction , and other aspects of life in taiwan . on the subject of cross-strait relations , chen stressed that the people of taiwan and mainland china share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one china . "
he also promised that during his presidency , as long as the communist party regime renounces the use of military force against taiwan , he will : -lrb- 1 -rrb- not declare independence ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- not change the nation 's name ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- not push for the inclusion of the " state - to - state " formula in the constitution ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- not promote a referendum on taiwan independence ; and -lrb- 5 -rrb- not seek to abolish the national reunification council or the national reunification guidelines .
he also had a message for his international audience , promising to make a more active contribution to safeguarding international human rights . he stated that taiwan would abide by the universal declaration of human rights , the international covenant on civil and political rights , and the vienna declaration and program of action .
he also indicated that the new government would request the legislative yuan to pass and ratify the international bill of rights as a domestic law of taiwan , so that it would formally become the " taiwan bill of rights . " later in the day , taiwan 's various political parties all released statements on the inaugural address .
chang jung - kung , director - general of the kuomintang 's department of mainland affairs , stated that chen failed to break any new ground in his statements on cross-strait relations , and said that while chen had succeeded in calming the atmosphere for the time being , the stalemate remains unresolved .
the people first party -lrb- pfp -rrb- and new party -lrb- np -rrb- gave a more positive evaluation .
pfp secretary - general david chung felt that the president had sent a positive signal to the mainland , but that his domestic policy lacked the sense of direction that would come from a comprehensive vision .
np convener hau lung - pin commended chen for his finessing of the " one china " issue .
beijing responded almost immediately to chen 's speech . while expressing dissatisfaction at his avoidance of the " one china " issue , they also stated that it might be possible to re-start cross-strait negotiations if taiwan were willing to return to the one china formula adopted during talks in 1992 , when it was agreed that each side could maintain its own interpretation of what " one china " means .
us president bill clinton praised chen 's speech as pragmatic and constructive , and stated his hope that the two sides would be able to resume dialogue at an early date .
japan 's foreign minister yohei kono also commented favorably , indicating his government 's hope that the two sides can engage in dialogue and work for a peaceful resolution of the cross-strait issue now that the new president has taken office .
in addition to heads of state and representatives from countries with which taiwan enjoys either formal diplomatic ties or friendly relations , the inaugural was also attended by three generations of democracy activists from mainland china -lrb- lin xiling , wei jingsheng , and wang dan -rrb- and lech walesa , the 1983 nobel peace prize winner and former president of poland .
all these visitors complimented chen shui - bian for his speech and expressed support for taiwan 's determination to follow the path of democracy , freedom , and peace . on the evening of inauguration day , chen shui - bian carried out two functions at the grand hotel .
after hosting a gathering of dpp members on one floor of the hotel , the president then proceeded to an official state banquet for vips on another floor of the same hotel .
at the dpp function , party chairman lin yi - hsiung had a word of caution for his fellow party members : " we must not let our newly attained power go to our heads . " there was also a big inaugural celebration on the big square that evening at the chiang kai - shek memorial . the celebration moved the next evening to kaohsiung , and other celebrations went on all across the island .
the sun yat - sen memorial hall marked the occasion by holding a special exhibit of contemporary chinese painting , and all sorts of hot - selling commemorative products appeared on the market , including alcoholic beverages , coins , pens , etc . everyone has high hopes for the new presidency , but we must remember that may 20th is just the first step on a long journey . if a brighter future is to actually take shape , the government and citizens will have to work for it . p. 75 in his may 20th inaugural address , chen shui - bian -lrb- left -rrb- declared the advent of a new era . shown at right is vice president annette lu . -lrb- photo by diago chiu -rrb- p. 76 to highlight the new president 's humble beginnings , the post-inaugural state banquet went long on typical taiwanese dishes . the menus were printed on fans like the one shown here . -lrb- photo by hsueh chi - kuang -rrb- p. 77 pop diva chang hui - mei sang the roc national anthem at the inaugural and angered the chinese communists , who reacted by pulling her long - running sprite commercials from the air and banning the sale of her music . no one had expected a pop star like ah - mei to get embroiled in cross-strait politics . -lrb- photo by diago chiu -rrb-
taiwan stands up : moving toward a brighter future leaders of our friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from taiwan and abroad ;
this is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .
i thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .
we are here today , not just to celebrate an inauguration , but to witness the flowering of hard - won democratic values and the dawn of a new era .
on the eve of the 21st century , the people of taiwan have completed a historic alternation of political parties in power .
this is not only the first of its kind in the history of the republic of china , but also an epochal landmark for chinese communities around the world .
taiwan has not only set a new model for the asian experience of democracy , but has also added an inspiring example to the third wave of democracy the world over .
the election for the 10th - term president of the republic of china has clearly shown the world that the fruits of freedom and democracy are not easy to come by .
twenty - three million people , through the power of determined will , have dispelled enmity with love , overcome intimidation with hope , and conquered fear with faith .
with our sacred votes we have proved to the world that freedom and democracy are indisputable universal values , and that peace is humanity 's highest goal .
the outcome of taiwan 's year 2000 presidential election is not the victory of an individual or a political party .
it is a victory of the people as well as a victory for democracy , because we have , while attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to our feet together .
taiwan stands up , demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .
taiwan stands up , representing the self - confidence of the people and the dignity of the country .
taiwan stands up , symbolizing the quest for hope and the realization of dreams .
dear compatriots , let 's always remember this moment ; let 's always remember to value and feel gratitude for it , because the fruits of democracy did not come out of the blue . we reaped the fruits only after we had been subjected to many perils and countless hardships .
if not for the fearless sacrifice of our democratic forebears , if not for the unswerving faith of the tens of millions of taiwanese people in freedom and democracy , we could not possibly be standing on our beloved land today and celebrating a glorious occasion that belongs to all the people .
today , it is as if we are standing before a fresh new gate of history .
in the process of democratization , the taiwanese people have created a brand - new key to our shared destiny .
the new century 's gates of hope are soon to open .
we are humble but not submissive .
we are full of self - confidence but do not have the slightest bit of complacence .
since that moment on march 18 when the election results came to light , i have accepted the mandate of all taiwanese people in a most earnest and humble frame of mind , and have vowed to devote all my heart , knowledge and courage to assuming the heavy responsibility for our country 's future .
i personally understand that the significance of the alternation of political parties and of the peaceful transition of power lies not in that it is a change of personnel or political parties .
nor in that it is a dynastic change .
rather , it is the return of state and government power to the people through a democratic procedure .
the country belongs to the people , rather than to any individual or political party .
the government and its officials , from the head of state down to the rank - and - file employees , exist for the service of the people . the alternation of political parties does not mean an across - the - board negation of the past . we should be fair in evaluating the contributions made by those in power throughout the ages .
mr. lee teng - hui deserves our highest tribute and heartfelt gratitude for his promotion of democratic reforms and for his excellent performance during his twelve years of leadership .
taiwan society has rallied and participated energetically in the election . despite the diverse views and stances , all individuals share the same commitment - to come forward for the sake of their political ideas and the country 's future . we believe that the end of an election is the beginning of reconciliation .
after the curtain falls on emotional campaigns , rationality should prevail .
under the supreme principles of national interest and the welfare of the people , those in power and in opposition should both fulfill their mandates given by the people and realize the ideals of fair competition in multiparty politics , as well as the checks and balances of democratic politics .
a democratic society with fair competition , tolerance and trust is the strongest impetus for a nation 's development .
placing national interests above those of political parties , we should solidify the will of the people and seek consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , to promote the country 's progress and reforms .
" a government for all people " and " rule by the clean and upright " are promises i made to the people during the campaign period .
they are also taiwan 's key to stepping over its fault lines and rising to a higher level in the future . the spirit of " a government for all people " lies in the fact that " the government exists for the people . " the people are the masters and shareholders of the state .
the government should rule on the basis of majority public opinion . the interests of the people should reign supreme over those of any political party or individual . i have always taken pride in being a member of the democratic progressive party , but from the moment i take my oath and assume the presidency , i will put all my efforts into fulfilling my role as a " president for all people . "
as in the formation of the new government , we recruit people according to their talents and do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , gender or party affiliation . the welfare of the populace shall be our primary goal in the future .
" rule by the clean and upright " has as its topmost priority the elimination of " black gold " - the involvement of organized crime and moneyed interests in politics - and the eradication of vote - buying . for a long time , the taiwanese people have been deeply repelled by moneyed politics and the interference of organized crime .
vote - buying in grassroots elections has also robbed the people of their right to elect the wise and the able , and tainted the development of taiwan 's democracy .
today , i am willing to promise that the new government will eliminate vote - buying and crack down on " black gold " politics , so that taiwan can rise above such sinking forces and ensure rule by the clean and upright .
we must give the people a clean political environment .
in the area of government reforms , we need to establish a government that is clean , efficient , far - sighted , dynamic , highly flexible and responsive , in order to ensure taiwan 's competitiveness in the face of increasingly fierce global competition .
the age of " large and capable " governments has now passed , replaced by one of " small and effective " governments , which have established partnership relations with the people .
we should accelerate the streamlining of government functions and organization and actively expand the role of public participation .
this will not only allow the public to fully utilize its energy but also significantly reduce the government 's burdens . similar partnership relations should also be set up between the central and local governments . we want to break the authoritarian and centralized control over both power and money . we want to realize the spirit of local autonomy , where the local and central governments share resources and responsibilities , where " the central government will not do what the local governments can . "
whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced . we should understand that the government is no panacea for all ills .
the driving force for economic development and societal progress is the people . over the past half - century , the taiwanese people have toiled hard to create an economic miracle that has won global applause , and to lay the foundation for the survival and development of the republic of china .
today , facing the impact of fast - changing information technologies and trade liberalization , taiwan must move toward a knowledge - based economy .
high - tech industries need to be constantly innovative , while traditional ones have to undergo transformation and upgrading . in the future , the government should not necessarily play the role of a " leader " or " manager . "
on the contrary , it should be the " supporter " and " service provider , " as expected by private enterprises .
the responsibility of a modern government is to raise administrative efficiency , improve the domestic investment environment , and maintain financial order and stock market stability , so as to allow the economy to move toward full liberalization and globalization through fair competition .
based on these principles , the vitality of the public will naturally bloom and create a new phase in taiwan 's economic miracle .
apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self - confidence and a better quality of life .
let our society not only be safe , harmonious and prosperous , but also follow the principles of fairness and justice .
as we cultivate the ever - growing abilities of our citizens , we will let our next generation learn in an environment filled with happiness and hope .
the 21st century will be a time when " the right to a quality life " and " a refined way of life " are much emphasized . the government will find solutions for issues relating to the people 's lives , such as law and order , social welfare , environmental protection , land - use planning , waste disposal , river cleaning , transportation and community renewal .
it will also have to implement these solutions thoroughly . at present , we need to immediately improve law and order and environmental protection , two important indicators of the quality of life . we will build a new social order so that the people may live in peace without fear .
a balance must be ensured between nature conservation and economic development so that taiwan may develop into a sustainable green silicon island . judicial integrity is the bulwark of political democracy and social justice .
an impartial , independent judiciary is a protector of social order and a defender of the people 's rights .
at present , we still have a long way to go in our judicial reforms .
our compatriots must continue to keep close watch over the judiciary and voice their expectations .
at the same time , we should also restrain our administrative power and give the judiciary room to operate independently and without interference .
humans are taiwan 's most important resources .
talented people hold the key to the country 's competitiveness , while education is the long - term cause underpinning " accumulating wealth among the people . "
we will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top - notch talents amid the fierce international competition . we will let taiwan move gradually toward being a " learning organism " and a " knowledge - based society . "
we will also encourage people to take up lifetime learning to fully develop their potential and creativity . grassroots community organizations are now developing around the country , working to explore and preserve the history , culture , geography and ecology of their localities .
these are all part of taiwan culture , whether they are local cultures , mass cultures or high cultures .
due to special historical and geographical factors , taiwan possesses a wealth of diversified cultural elements .
but cultural development is not something that can bring immediate success . rather , it has to be accumulated bit by bit .
we must open our hearts with tolerance and respect , so that our diverse ethnic groups and different regional cultures may communicate with each other , and so that taiwan 's local cultures may connect with the cultures of chinese - speaking communities and other world cultures , and create a new milieu of " a cultural taiwan in a modern century . "
the september 21 earthquake that struck last year brought to our land and our compatriots an unprecedented catastrophe , the pain of which is yet to heal .
the new government will brook no delay in the reconstruction of disaster areas , including industrial and spiritual recovery . we will not cease until the last victim is taken care of and the last destroyed place is rebuilt .
here , we would like to express our highest respect again for all individuals and nongovernmental organizations that have selflessly lent a hand to the rescue and reconstruction work after the disaster .
amid the fierce power of nature , we have seen taiwan 's most beautiful compassion , strongest faith and greatest trust .
our compatriots have been injured by the september 21 earthquake , but with the spirit of a " volunteer taiwan , " taiwan 's new family will stand up resolutely on its feet once again .
dear compatriots , 400 years ago taiwan was called " ihla formosa " - the beautiful island - for its lustrous landscape .
today , taiwan is manifesting the elegance of a democratic island , once again attracting global attention , as the people on this land create a new page in our history .
we believe that the republic of china , with its democratic achievements and technological and economic prowess , can certainly continue to play an indispensable role in the international community .
in addition to strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , we want to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .
through humanitarian care , economic cooperation , cultural exchanges and various other ways , we will actively participate in international affairs , expand taiwan 's room for survival in the international arena , and contribute to the welfare of the international community .
besides , we are also willing to commit to a more active contribution in safeguarding international human rights .
the republic of china can not and will not remain outside global human rights trends . we will abide by the universal declaration of human rights , the international convention for civil and political rights , and the vienna declaration and program of action . we will bring the republic of china back into the international human rights system .
the new government will urge the legislative yuan to ratify the international bill of rights as a domestic law of taiwan , so that it will formally become the " taiwan bill of rights . "
we hope to set up an independent national human rights commission in taiwan , thereby realizing an action long advocated by the united nations . we will also invite two outstanding nongovernmental organizations , the international commission of jurists and amnesty international , to assist us in our measures to protect human rights and make the republic of china into a new indicator for human rights in the 21st century .
we firmly believe that at no time , nor in any corner of the world , can the meaning and values of freedom , democracy and human rights be ignored or changed .
the 20th century left us with a major lesson - that war is a failure of humanity .
waged for whatever lofty purposes or high - sounding reasons , war is the greatest harm to freedom , democracy and human rights .
over the past one hundred plus years , china has suffered imperialist aggression , which left indelible wounds .
taiwan has had an even sadder fate , tormented by brute force and colonial rule .
these similar historical experiences should bring mutual understanding between the people on the two sides of the taiwan strait , setting a solid foundation for pursuing freedom , democracy and human rights together .
however , due to the long period of separation , the two sides have developed vastly different political systems and ways of life , obstructing empathy and friendship between the people on the two sides , and even creating a wall of divisiveness and confrontation .
today , as the cold war has ended , it is time for the two sides to cast aside the hostility left from the old era . we do not need to wait further because there is a new opportunity now for the two sides to create an era of reconciliation together .
the people on the two sides of the taiwan strait share the same ancestral , cultural , and historical background .
while upholding the principles of democracy and parity , building upon the existing foundations , and constructing conditions for cooperation through good will , we believe that the leaders on both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one china . "
i fully understand that , as the popularly elected 10th - term president of the republic of china , i must abide by the constitution , maintain the sovereignty , dignity and security of our country , and ensure the well - being of all citizens .
therefore , as long as the ccp regime has no intention to use military force against taiwan , i pledge that during my term in office , i will not declare independence , i will not change the national title , i will not push forth the inclusion of the so - called " state - to - state " description in the constitution , and i will not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to the question of independence or unification .
furthermore , there is no question of abolishing the guidelines for national unification and the national unification council . history has proved that war will lead to more hatred and enmity , without the least help to the development of mutual relations .
chinese people emphasize the difference between statesmanship and hegemony , believing in the philosophy that a government which employs benevolence " will please those near and appeal to those from afar , " and " when those from afar will not submit , then one must practice kindness and virtue to attract them . "
such chinese wisdom will remain a universal value . under the leadership of mr. deng xiaoping and mr. jiang zemin , the mainland has created a miracle of economic openness .
in taiwan , over a half century , not only have we created a miracle economy , we have also created the political marvel of democracy .
on such a basis , as long as the governments and people on the two sides of the taiwan strait can interact more , following the principles of " goodwill reconciliation , active cooperation , and permanent peace , " while at the same time respecting the free choice of the people and excluding unnecessary obstacles , both sides of the strait can make great contributions to the prosperity and stability of the asia - pacific region .
both sides will also create a glorious civilization for humanity . dear compatriots , we hope so much to share the moving scene of this moment with all chinese - speaking people around the world .
the wide ketagelan boulevard before us was bristling with security guards only a few years ago . the building behind me used to be the governor general 's mansion during the colonial era .
today , we gather here to extol the glory and joy of democracy with songs of the land and the voice of the people .
with a little reflection , our compatriots should be able to appreciate the deep and far - reaching meaning of this moment : authoritarianism and force can only bring surrender for one time , while democracy and freedom are values that will endure forever .
only by adhering to the will of the people can we pioneer the paths of history and build enduring architecture .
today , as the son of a tenant farmer with a poor family background , i have struggled and grown on this land and , after experiencing defeat and tribulation , i have finally won the trust of the people to take up the great responsibility of leading the country .
my individual achievements are minor , but the message is valuable because each citizen of formosa is a " child of taiwan " just like me .
in whatever difficult environment , taiwan will be like a selfless , loving mother , who never stops giving her children opportunities and who helps them realize beautiful dreams .
the spirit of the " child of taiwan " reveals to us that even though taiwan , penghu , kinmen and matsu are tiny islands on the rim of the pacific , the map of our dreams knows no limits .
the map extends all the way to the horizon as long as our 23 million compatriots fear no hardship and move forward hand in hand .
dear compatriots , this magnificent moment belongs to all the people . all grace and glory belongs to taiwan - our eternal mother .
together , let 's extend our gratitude to the earth and our respect to the people .
long live freedom and democracy !
long live the people of taiwan !

the genuine article -- our french nanny
-lrb- chou chin - cheng / tr. scott williams -rrb-
when my wife 's company sent her to paris to work , we did n't think that our daughter , then just over a year old , would have any problems with attending school there . little did we imagine a colleague would inform us that her daughter had been " surrounded and attacked " by a group of young french children on her first day of pre-school .
the incident frightened her so badly that she would n't let her daughter go back to school . if that was the case , my wife and i had a serious problem on our hands . what could we do with chien - chien if she was going to be viewed as a " little foreigner " and be bullied at school every day ?
the only solution seemed to be to have her learn french . that way , if we ended up in court , at least she would n't have to stand there mute .
and so we hired martine , a frenchwoman in her 50s , to be chien - chien 's nanny .
my wife truly treasures chien - chien , and was not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving her with someone else .
first , we had no idea what kind of person martine was .
we knew only that she was a licensed nanny with documents from the french government , and hiring her to look after chien - chien seemed better than hiring a cheaper unlicensed nanny .
second , chien - chien understood no french , so we were concerned that she might be mistreated . we could n't have guessed that martine would treasure her just as much as my wife does . and martine knew how to handle children !
my wife and i thank heaven for her . i remember the first day we took chien - chien to martine 's place . my wife and chien - chien played out an extended farewell scene before finally tearfully parting .
and her father ?
although i understood no french in those days , i was prepared to spend the whole day with chien - chien . i wanted to convey to martine the idea that " if you beat the dog , you 'd better be prepared to deal with the master . "
but in spite of my resolution , within ten minutes , with martine gesturing and chien - chien sobbing , i was hustled out the door .
at first , i thought i had better stand outside and " keep an eye on things , " but then i realized that that would n't accomplish anything , and i made my dejected way home .
later martine told my wife that i had had to leave unless i wanted to spend my entire life holding chien - chien 's hand . it took martine to remind us that short , sharp pains are better than long , drawn - out suffering .
at the outset , we were concerned that chien - chien would n't like french food , so we prepared a lunchbox for her everyday and delivered it with her to martine .
but every evening , her lunchbox came back untouched . was n't she eating ?
thinking , " if this continues , she 'll starve to death , " we confronted martine .
confronted , martine calmly informed us that chien - chien could n't spend her entire time in france eating the lunchboxes we prepared .
and , she continued , since that was the case , why not get chien - chien used to eating french food as soon as possible ?
furthermore , she informed us that her own nutritious homemade meals would help chien - chien grow . she was even planning to prepare a " dinner box " for chien - chien to bring home in the evenings . our " confrontation " turned into an abject apology !
one day , martine mentioned to us that chien - chien was a little cross-eyed .
however , she said we were not to worry because children 's eyes usually correct themselves as they get older .
to ease our minds , she had already taken chien - chien to see her uncle , an ophthalmologist .
if chien - chien would visit him again four or five times at two - week intervals , everything would be fine . when we asked her about the fee , she would only say that it should n't be much .
in fact , she never did tell us .
usually , nannies view sick children as an annoyance because they require more care , and often must be given medication .
as a result , most nannies expect that a child 's family will take care of it when it is sick .
but martine was different .
when the weather turned cool and chien - chien came down with a fever , martine called my wife to offer to keep chien - chien for the night .
she told my wife that she had been a nurse and that taking chien - chien home in the cold night air might worsen her chill .
my wife , who had been hoping to take care of our sick daughter herself when she got home from work , naturally declined her kind offer .
in this way , we became more and more comfortable -lrb- and more and more grateful -rrb- having martine as chien - chien 's nanny .
i think martine treated chien - chien just as if she were her own child .
our daughter is now three years old and attends a pre-school near our home . chien - chien 's teacher has told my wife that chien - chien 's french is very good .
perhaps because our little " foreigner " now speaks french , she gets along very well with her classmates ; they all remember her french name , elodie , and let her know that i 'm there when they see me coming to pick her up after school . we owe all of this to martine . we were lucky to find someone so skilled in the art of being a nanny .
she helped us so much . thank you , martine ! p. 111 chien - chien and martine at the eurodisney in paris .
money for nothin' ... but it 's not risk free
-lrb- laura li / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by phil newell -rrb- it is said that the two hottest subjects in post-martial law taiwan have been sex and personal money management , which certainly goes to show the degree of openness and pluralism in today 's society .
moreover , like sex , personal money management is something that many people only vaguely understand , that they feel uncertain about committing themselves to , and that leaves them feeling tired and empty .
personal money management is now a national sport . the wealthy hope to roll their money over , while those less well off are trying to make a small pile of their own .
but what kind of money management approach is best suited to the current era ?
how can one win in the investment game without losing the game of life in the process ?
" earning money is the first priority , spending money is a sin , long live personal money management ! "
thus declares a poster on the wall of a certain " miss chen , " a secretary in a trucking company in pingtung . every night before going to sleep she turns on her computer to check out the closing share prices for the taiwan stock exchange and the opening figures for the us exchanges , and then makes a quick calculation in her head of her total wealth .
this woman , who is nearing 30 and has been working for seven years , has a " personal value " which is still less than nt$ 600,000 , so in order to build up a fund for investing , she will not buy a house or go abroad for travel , and she 's becoming a scrooge in the eyes of her friends .
yet , all her discipline and her enthusiasm can not guarantee that she makes money . and sometimes when she looks at the poster on her wall , she feels as if she is being mocked .
if i knew then what i know now ...
liu li - chih , a 25 - year - old teacher , is another e-generation personal money management enthusiast .
even before he did his compulsory military service , he began making investments of nt$ 3,000 per month in a japan technology fund . over three years , the fund has gone from taking losses to taking off ; though it has levelled off somewhat lately , the returns have been excellent .
liu declares himself to be " a faithful believer " in all manner of personal money management books , and when he has free time in summer vacation , he spends an average of 20 hours a week looking at investment information . his greatest regret is that he began his financial career too late . he says : " if i had used my allowance every year from the time i was small to invest in a fund , at the rate of nt$ 30,000 per year , after 20 years , there would be quite a lot of money right now . " becoming increasingly agitated , he adds that if he had understood money management early on , he could have invested right after the big stock market collapse in 1990 , and he would be rich today instead of regretful .
it looks like more and more of the e-generation are getting into investing . but do they know what they are doing ? dennis chien of the money management website called jp investment clinic strikes a cautionary note : " i do n't think the education system has fulfilled its responsibility to teach people how to manage their money . "
chien points out that school textbooks only teach moral lessons like " a penny saved is a penny earned , " which are not exactly what the real world demands these days . in contrast , many american children understand a bit about money management from early on .
for example , a child in her early teens might babysit for the neighbors or cut lawns , and then put the money in a mutual fund . some investment websites have games for children to teach them about various investment instruments and portfolios . these treat personal money management as a serious life skill that all modern people should know . chien says that the situation is just like sex education in the past .
they give it only the most cursory treatment in schools , but most people have a strong desire to find out about it , so as a result they have to pick up what they can from the newspapers or cable tv . the result of the lack of a proper investment outlook is that speculation is rampant .
according to statistics of the ministry of finance , 87.5 % of the trading volume on the taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors .
in 1999 turnover was 288 % -lrb- that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market -rrb- , which , though considerably down from nearly 600 % ten years before , remained four times higher than the new york stock exchange . despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .
a new climate for the e-generation
fortunately , over the last three years foreign investors have brought some new ideas into the country . although they still engage in " hit - and - run " high - volume trading for quick gains , at least most foreign investors ignore gossip and do n't touch the more speculative stocks .
rather , they put more emphasis on the fundamentals of a given company or industry . dennis chien notes that foreign firms have also introduced risk management ideas like " having a well - rounded portfolio " -lrb- i.e. " do n't put all your eggs in one basket " -rrb- . these have had a positive impact on the local stock market , and have given the investment activities of the e-generation a more rational foundation than those of their parents .
the chief characteristics of the current wave of e-generation personal money management are great ambition , reliance on expert analysis , and diversification of investment targets .
nevertheless , the hottest investments are always changing , and perhaps no amount of rational analysis or detailed information will be able to change this .
chia chen - i , senior executive vice president of the individual banking sector at bank sinopac -lrb- which earlier this year created a stir in the industry by introducing the world 's first five - in - one money management account -rrb- has been observing the evolution of the financial environment in taiwan for many years , and offers the following thoughts about trends in money management .
chia recalls that in the 1960s , people were too poor to have any money to manage ; there were also fears of war , and so any money people did have they quickly exchanged for gold or us dollars on the black market .
in the 1970s , faced with two oil crises and inflation , the idea of buying property to preserve value became widespread , and those who could afford it bought land and houses . at that time , the stock market had only a hundred or so listed companies , and its fate depended on a few manipulators behind the scenes .
it was seen as a " cannibalistic market " which scared off most citizens . the past is gone the real fad for personal money management only hit taiwan in the mid-1980s . it was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface .
the huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the nt dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into taiwan .
the stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of nt$ 71,800 per ping -lrb- about 3.3 square meters -rrb- in 1986 to nt$ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .
at that time , great opportunities for making money stared one right in the face .
in pursuit of overnight wealth , many people mortgaged their property to buy stocks , and then used their stocks as collateral to borrow more money , creating a vicious cycle that laid the foundation for the burst bubble and huge debts of later years .
but , having reviewed the past , chia chen - i declares : " in money management , you can only look to the future ; there 's no point in regretting what 's gone . "
indeed , in the era of the internet , with everything moving much faster , investment indicators like product popularity and employment trends can change overnight .
those who can not see the trends or who can not react fast enough are doomed to be the losers in the wealth game .
take for example the case of mrs. chang . widowed at an early age , for over 20 years she supported her family as an independent real estate broker . her success made her very confident about her understanding of the property market .
six years ago , she decided to help the family of her younger brother , who contracted a terminal illness , to buy a new house . at the time , the price of high - rise apartments in the tanshui new town had fallen from nt$ 220,000 per ping to nt$ 150,000 . congratulating herself on getting a low price , and confident that the market would rebound , mrs. chang happily put down the first payment and watched her brother 's family move in .
however , it was about this time that many new projects - started earlier by construction firms hoping to take advantage of peak prices - came on the market .
the number of empty units rose to over one million . next , increased cross-strait tensions put a further damper on the property market . the september 21 earthquake last year was the final straw .
today you can find high - rise apartments in tanshui new town for as little as nt$ 110,000 per ping . mrs. chang 's brother 's family is stuck with a heavy mortgage , and there are constant recriminations between mrs. chang and her nieces and nephews.
will the taiwan property market inevitably recover ? not necessarily .
looking around the world , at the us , japan , hong kong , and even mainland china , there are countless examples of long - term downturns in the housing market .
the popular book die broke notes that the sharp rise in housing prices in the us in the 1960s and 1970s was due to underlying structural factors : the large generation of " baby boomers " were starting careers and families , thereby increasing demand for housing . at that time , some of the older generation about to retire happily sold their houses to the younger at high prices .
the large profits they earned attracted numerous speculators into the market , and prices were driven even higher , encouraging construction of ever more homes .
but now that most of the baby boomers have their own homes , and the current " e-generation " is smaller , who are all those extra homes going to be sold to ?
snafu
the upshot of all this is , as hsu yen - shan , chairman of the department of finance at national chengchi university , cautions : " there are no absolute experts at money management . " so - called experts are simply those who have particular knowledge about a certain sector in a certain place at a certain time .
but you know the old saying : " people have two feet , but money has four . " trends change faster than most people can anticipate . no wonder the " stock masters " featured on cable tv usually disappear from view after a brief reign , only to be replaced by equally short - lived successors .
in the past two years , perhaps brainwashed by money management dogma that says " the early bird gets the worm , " investors have swarmed like bees for the latest fads , sometimes jumping in even before the true value is known .
the us nasdaq index , which has a history of 29 years behind it , suddenly surged from 2800 in october of last year to more than 5000 by march of this year . telecommunications , internet , and biotechnology stocks soared . the price - to - earnings ratio of some individual stocks reached 500 , which some ridiculed as the " price - to - dream ratio . " " investors sometimes act as if they do n't care about a company 's current losses , but simply put all their faith in the distant future .
unfortunately , the farther in the future something is , the more likely it is that expectations will be wrong , " points out chiu shean - bii , a professor of finance at national taiwan university .
beginning in mid-march of this year , nasdaq high - tech stocks plummeted . for many investors , earnings accumulated over many years disappeared in a matter of weeks .
the misguided idea that " what is new is better " also has been a problem in taiwan .
a certain " mr. wang , " who works in the government , last year thought he would jump on the bandwagon for telecom and internet stocks . he borrowed money to purchase 80 blocks of shares , at nt$ 13 per share , of fixed - line internet network stocks , which had n't yet even been listed . when the price fell to nt$ 11 per share , he still did n't worry , thinking that " so long as i do n't sell , the loss wo n't be realized . " little did he expect that the new government would clamp down on illegal trading in fixed - line network stocks .
suddenly his whole investment - well over nt$ 1 million - has been frozen , and all he can do is stand on the sidelines in a state of panic .
to be sure , ignorance of new trends is not recommended , but looking too far into the future can also lead to disappointment .
indeed , in this information era , money management may even be getting more difficult . strange to say , but the explosion of money management information , which should in theory make investors ' lives easier , does not .
as chiu shean - bii says : " there 's plenty of information out there , and there are so - called experts everywhere .
but the result is that investors do n't know what to believe , and find it even more difficult to make a decision . " moreover , often even the best information and analysis is no match for sheer luck . cabula chang , editor - in - chief of the money management website smartnet , describes a case in point . last year , one of the hottest stocks was quanta computers , which reached 800 per share . the story goes that there was an old grandmother who followed the crowd in and out of the stock , earning a huge amount in the process . afterwards , she asked : " what i still do n't understand is , how can selling pork jerky be so profitable ? "
it turns out that she thought she was investing in a dried - pork company of the same name , and those who heard her question nearly fainted with disbelief .
money management madness the fever for money management has in fact disrupted the lives of many people , and brought a lot of headaches . however , jessica liu , associate director of the taipei branch of ubs , who has written a number of books on money management , says that there is no turning back .
whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . the reason is very simple . " the money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " according to liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .
in addition , since the 1980s taiwan has been swept up in the globalization of capitalism . rural society has disintegrated , and traditional industrial sectors have withered , as newly rising electronics and information industries have appeared one after another . these rapid changes have brought the threat of unemployment or early retirement to many individuals .
in order to cope with the increasing uncertainty of life , it is necessary for people to build up a nest egg .
liu says : " if you have nt$ 30 million in the bank , you do n't care whether you have to retire or not . what 's important is that you do n't have to worry about the future , and live in fear that a sudden loss of your salary could ruin your life . " of course , everyone feels a different sense of urgency about the uncertainties of life .
sometimes , in fact , this can become a source of interpersonal friction .
" miss chen " of pingtung worries that her father , soon to retire at age 60 , does n't think much about money , and his expected retirement plus savings will be less than nt$ 4 million -lrb- about us$ 120,000 -rrb- .
you manage , i benefit ?
as miss chen does not hesitate to say : " my mom and dad still think that it would only mean an extra set of chopsticks on the table for them to live with their daughter . it seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . they have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " she has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success .
indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother . meanwhile , the changes in the larger environment that are making people anxious about their economic security are boons to companies trying to market financial products .
a certain american bank has recently been doing " carpet bombing " advertising with slogans like " one out of every two people wants to retire ten years early , but has n't yet begun a financial plan ! " or " 60 % of parents want to send their children abroad to study , but one - third of these do n't know how much money they should prepare ! "
it is said that these ads have been very effective .
chen yi - fen , vice president of the individual banking department at fubon bank , speaking as someone who has been closely following this problem from the sidelines , reminds consumers that no matter what the source - advertising , websites , or whatever - though advice may be cloaked in a halo of expertise , the motive is to sell products and to earn money from the financial activities of clients .
chen says : " it 's like those ads for milk that emphasize how fearful osteoporosis is .
the problem is , they do n't tell you that milk is by no means the only way to prevent this , or even the most effective . "
it ai n't over till it 's over another factor driving " investment anxiety " is peer pressure . " if a 40 - year - old does not have a securities account , he wo n't be able to engage in conversations with his peers about the market , so naturally he will feel out of touch , " says cabula chang . chang admits that he still lives in a rented house in tanshui .
his wife wonders why his colleagues in the financial management community are multi-millionaires , while he still has not had his rendezvous with fortune .
chang tells his wife that one should not compare oneself to others . their success may be temporary or even illusory . a number of his friends who had insider information were quite proud of themselves when they profited from the rise of taiwan pineapple to more than 200 . but within less than two years , the stock collapsed and became worthless paper .
chang recalls an inexperienced reporter who got sucked in to the market two years ago by some irresistible insider information . he even mortgaged his house and persuaded his friends to invest with him . today , he still has not got his head above water .
chang says , " the longer i 'm in this business , the more i feel that you ca n't get anywhere by trying to get ahead quickly . " investment options are like churning whirlpools ; of course you enjoy the ride as long as you are on top of the water , but currents shift , and eventually you may get sucked down . " in investing , until the final moment , you never know whether you 've won or lost . "
jessica liu , who personally feels little anxiety about money management , points out that one of her core principles for investing is to not compare herself with others .
" this is because i know that opportunities to make money come and go . if i do n't make a lot this wave , there 'll be another wave later . "
she says that anxiety rises in direct proportion to a person 's expectations and desires . the more you want , the more anxiety you feel , and the greater will be the sense of disappointment if you fail . in other words , anxiety derives from greed .
" if you buy tsmc at 150 hoping it will go up to 220 within a couple of months because that 's what you need to make your final house payment , then it only goes up to 200 , you 'll feel dissatisfied , " says liu . this sense of disappointment is completely due to the lack of a proper money management outlook . people in middle age invest in hopes of finding a sense of personal security .
but members of the e-generation often have more specific objectives in mind . lin yu - ting , currently a sophomore in the department of financial management at national chengchi university , puts the money she makes working part - time into the market .
she says that she has " a specific plan for each period of time , such as going abroad , or buying a car . " so her aim is " to manage my money so that i can spend it ! " lin 's classmate ou chien - ming says that he has always wanted to save money to go traveling with his girlfriend .
last year , after vacillating for quite a while , he finally borrowed nt$ 80,000 from his mother to invest in stocks , under the assumption that , by putting to use what he was learning in school , it would n't be that hard to make a good return .
alas , he put his faith in the predictions of a certain investment adviser , and put everything he had into securities stocks , which stagnated . after the election of chen shui - bian as president , he mistakenly assumed that the market would go down , and sold everything without even looking at the share prices . he ended up selling at the low point , and his dream of going abroad is even farther out of reach than it was before .
healthy money management
chiu shean - bii of national taiwan university was told in a recent meeting with the general manager of certain large american commercial bank : " asians always ask : ' is the market going to go up or down tomorrow ? ' but investment advisors are not weather forecasters , and we do n't pretend that we can know the future . "
this banker says that his money management target is not to make a specific profit within a specific time , but to use a variety of financial instruments - including defensive investments like insurance and reliable ones like savings , as well as an active investment portfolio - to appropriately diversify his assets . he seeks to " build a noah 's ark . when the weather is good , you can make a little more progress , but when storms hit , you can ride them out . "
chen yi - fen , who comes across all manner of money management plans every day , often wonders about the meaning of it all .
she says that today banks are always talking about how they want to provide every individual with tools to " intelligently manage money . " for example , they provide credit cards that award bonus points , housing loans with built - in short - term overdrafts for investment , and even mutual fund accounts that will automatically invest a specific amount at fixed times .
but how much money is enough ?
that depends on the values of the individual .
" each individual should choose a lifestyle and belief system that they feel comfortable with , and not just follow the crowd , " says chen .
after all , in a pluralized society , there should be more than one definition of success . recently there was a news story about the old author chang tuo - wu having to sell lottery tickets on the street .
one financial expert took chang as an object lesson to " warn " people to learn how to manage their money . yet , looking at this another way , if chang had spent his youth worrying about accumulating money , he would not have had the experiences he did and made his way from being an ordinary soldier to writing such moving works .
in the end , there are no numbers that can validly measure what has been gained in life , and what lost .
it is said that the two biggest causes of family arguments this year have been differences over who to vote for in the presidential election , and over what stocks to buy .
as jessica liu reminds us , money management , like life itself , is an accumulation of small experiences , a long road with ups and downs , and so should be faced with equanimity .
after all , is n't the point of making money to have a better life ? but if you lose your sense of fun , your health , or your friends and family in the process , and if you win the money game only at the cost of losing the game of life , what kind of a return on your investment is that ?
president chen travels abroad -lrb- chang chiung - fang / tr. by david mayer -rrb- president chen shui - bian visited the nicaraguan national assembly on august 17 , where he received a medal from the president of the assembly , ivan escobar fornos . -lrb- photo by wu chi - chang , central news agency -rrb-
on august 25 president chen shui - bian wrapped up his first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in latin america and another three in africa .
while in the dominican republic to attend the inauguration of president hipolito mejia , chen had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations . the president signed joint communiques with nicaragua , gambia , and chad , and agreed to provide us$ 4.6 million worth of loans to the dominican republic to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the international monetary fund .
" we can not use pressure from beijing as an excuse for our diplomatic setbacks , " said chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to roc 's allies that our country has no intention of pulling back from its diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , the roc will be working even harder than before .
chen shui - bian left on august 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the latin american nations of the dominican republic , nicaragua , costa rica , as well as the west african nations of gambia , burkina faso , and chad .
before boarding the plane on the 13th , chen shui - bian delivered a short speech in which he stated , " taiwan must stand up and be counted . " the purpose of this trip , said chen , is to share taiwan 's experiences with other countries , and he also indicated the hope that this trip would help to solidify taiwan 's diplomatic relations .
the entourage was the largest ever to accompany an roc president abroad , and included : chuang ming - yao -lrb- secretary - general , national security council -rrb- , tien hung - mao -lrb- minister of foreign affairs -rrb- , lin hsin - yi -lrb- minister of economic affairs -rrb- , chen po - chih -lrb- chairman , council of economic planning and development -rrb- , chen hsi - huang -lrb- chairman , council of agriculture -rrb- , chung chin -lrb- head of the government information office -rrb- , jeffrey koo -lrb- chairman of the national association of industry and commerce -rrb- , wang yu - tseng -lrb- chairman of the general chamber of commerce of the roc -rrb- , and lin kun - chung -lrb- chairman of the chinese national federation of industries -rrb- . there were also many legislators in the delegation , including hung chi - chang , helen chu , feng ting - kuo , and li yin - yun . -lrb- li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the roc diplomatic post in washington , dc . -rrb-
the total size of the delegation came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .
the president kept to a very tight schedule during the trip . after a brief stopover in los angeles on the 13th , chen continued on and reached the dominican republic on the 14th . he attended the presidential inauguration there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world . on the 17th he continued on to nicaragua , where he met with president arnoldo aleman and delivered a speech to the nicaraguan national assembly . on the 18th , presidents chen and aleman signed a joint communique before chen shui - bian departed for costa rica , where he received the great cross of juan mora fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation 's highest award . on the 20th he flew across the atlantic ocean to gambia to meet with gambian president yahya jameh before heading on to burkina faso and a dinner with president blaise compaore . on the 23rd chen delivered a speech to the gambian parliament .
the next stop on the itinerary was chad , where chen dined with chad 's president idris debi . on the 25th chen and debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to taiwan slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful typhoon bilis . chen 's stopover in los angeles was a sensitive subject , for chen had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the us congress .
after furious protests from beijing and discouragement from the us state department , however , chen canceled the plan just the day before arriving in los angeles . a crowd of 500 to 600 taiwanese living in the united states showed up to greet the president at his hotel and protest against the us government 's " caving in to beijing at the expense of taiwan . "
when chen arrived on the 14th in the dominican republic , he was greeted at the airport by over 100 representatives of the taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 taiwanese residents threw a party for the president that night at his hotel .
the next day , chen took advantage of the upcoming presidential inauguration to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which the roc has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of el salvador and the second vice president of panama .
on the 16th chen attended the inauguration of president hipolito mejia . the roc contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .
the roc currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in latin america and the caribbean .
in recent years , however , mainland china has continually upgraded its trade links with the roc 's diplomatic partners . the allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .
in the case of the dominican republic , for example , supporters of president mejia announced to the media on the eve of president chen 's arrival that mainland china was planning to build a large thermal power plant in their country .
in addition , the dominican republic is seeking a seat on the un security council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for beijing 's support . this situation could affect relations with taiwan .
on the bright side , taiwan has scored a few points of its own in this diplomatic tug of war .
when chen arrived in costa rica on the 18th , his hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support the roc s bid for membership in the united nations .
costa rica 's president miguel rodriguez also accompanied president chen on a tour of a taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by taiwan sugar corporation , and a vocational training school .
president chen departed on the 20th for africa , where the roc has eight diplomatic partners .
chen shui - bian is the first roc president ever to travel to western africa .
there is little two - way trade between taiwan and any of the three countries on chen 's african itinerary .
instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of our diplomatic ties with these countries .
taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in burkina faso have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while taiwanese specialists sent to gambia have successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from taiwan and raised them on gambian soil .
in addition to this type of technical assistance , taiwan has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .
taiwan 's most notable contribution to gambia 's infrastructure is the main terminal at the airport .
gambian president yahya jameh declared his support for admission of the roc to the united nations , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of roc passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in gambia .
president chen 's trip yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but it was not problem - free .
first , as the president was preparing to depart taiwan , the nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon the roc to make good on the previous administration 's promise of us$ 100 million in assistance .
this remark sparked controversy in taiwan , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same " checkbook diplomacy " practiced by its predecessor .
chen shui - bian responded that while the new administration has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will it fail to honor the promises made by its predecessor .
foreign minister tien hung - mao stated that the purpose of chen 's trip was to consolidate taiwan 's diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation . tien stressed that the president would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .
president chen received a very warm welcome in nicaragua , but the local press still mentioned " checkbook diplomacy " in reporting on the visit . the roc 's ambassador to nicaragua , antonio tsai , bluntly argued in a briefing with chen that taiwan 's foreign assistance to nicaragua was being misused . according to tsai , the assistance has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the ministry of foreign affairs .
opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and western nations have also been critical .
a second problem connected with the trip was the question of who would act in the president 's stead while he was out of the country . concern over this issue prompted president chen to state before his departure that he would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that he would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency . the president said that there was no need for an acting president because he had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during his absence .
so is taiwan 's diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ? or is it checkbook diplomacy ? ambassador - without - portfolio lu yi - cheng wrote an article in which he argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why taiwan should have to steer clear of it .
he pointed out that the world 's developed nations spend an average of 0.24 % of gnp on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in taiwan 's case . in view of taiwan 's economic strength , argued lu , our foreign aid expenditures need not be reduced ; in fact , they should even be raised somewhat .
the roc has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when this issue cropped up in connection with the president 's trip .
the question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern . this situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration 's ability to govern . this is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .
stand up and join in ! roc diplomacy on the move
ever since the republic of china withdrew from the united nations in 1971 , nearly 30 years ago , taiwan 's foreign relations have been in a state of chronic crisis - leaving the people of taiwan with a diplomatic sword of damocles hanging permanently overhead .
in the last 30 years , taiwan has become an economic powerhouse , and taiwanese have become world travelers , yet there 's not a trace of taiwan in the united nations .
the shooting may have stopped half a century ago in the chinese civil war , but the war has been extended by other means - diplomacy . the overall international environment has not changed , but taiwan 's government has .
now the democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- , with which the chinese communist party has no historical relationship , is the ruling party .
in line with the old saying " the newborn calf does n't know that it should fear the tiger , " the new government has been especially active on the diplomatic front . in june of this year , foreign minister tien hung - mao visited macedonia and the vatican , the two countries in europe that have formal diplomatic relations with the roc . in august , president chen shui - bian traveled to six of taiwan 's diplomatic partners in central america and africa . in september , tien hung - mao again journeyed to europe , while vice president annette lu followed up on the president 's trip to with a visit of her own to roc diplomatic partners in latin america .
as is commonly known , taiwan 's diplomatic difficulties mainly are due to the cross-strait confrontation . will the flurry of high - level visits abroad by the new government bring the diplomatic breakthrough that taiwan 's people almost do n't dare to hope for ?
will china adopt a new containment policy ?
what counter-measures does the taiwan government have ?
in these visits abroad , the president and vice president traveled with large retinues , but the foreign minister kept a low profile . does the new government have anything in its bag of tricks that the old hands in the former kmt administration did not try ? some say that " national sovereignty " and " economic assistance " are the two " achilles heels " of taiwan 's foreign relations .
as soon as they are mentioned , they draw crippling fire .
" national sovereignty " meets with powerful resistance from mainland china , which resists taiwan 's efforts to establish interstate diplomatic links , a key indicator of sovereignty .
" economic assistance , " on the other hand , though an important tool in maintaining diplomatic ties , has been frequently ridiculed in taiwan as " checkbook diplomacy . " achilles heels " national sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , taiwan has long been suffering from prc efforts to undercut taiwan 's international status .
indeed , as levi c. ying , an overseas chinese legislator from the new party , says , mainland china is the only real obstacle and enemy to taiwan 's foreign relations .
in 1998 the prc made the boast that by the year 2000 the roc would have zero diplomatic partners , and moved to undercut taiwan 's relationships .
they are still trying to achieve this target . this july , a book published by the prc entitled chinese foreign policy , the year 2000 , declared that its most important foreign policy goal is to " reunify the country , " and strongly attacked taiwan 's efforts to be admitted to the united nations .
in terms of its relationships with the us and japan , mainland china makes the " taiwan problem " a top priority .
liu pi - jung , a professor of politics at soochow university , says that in looking at the diplomatic struggle between the roc and prc , it is useful to distinguish three arenas : the asia - pacific situation , formal diplomatic relations , and international organizations .
in terms of the asia - pacific situation , the prc strongly resists any international support for taiwan , such as the idea of placing taiwan within the scope of the " guidelines for us - japan defense cooperation . " thus the attitude of the us has become one of the key factors in cross-strait relations . since the new dpp administration took office in taipei , the prc has been deeply worried by the party 's advocacy of taiwan independence .
as a result , the two sides have yet to open any formal dialogue mechanism such as existed before the freezing of cross-strait relations which occurred after former president lee teng - hui went to the us in 1996 . meanwhile , taiwan 's position in the us - prc - roc triangle has deteriorated as a result of lee teng - hui 's " special state - to - state " formula and mainland china 's active efforts to improve relations with the us . an example of the latter is the september visit of prc president jiang zemin to new york to participate in the united nations millennial conference .
in the run - up to the us presidential election , there has been an effort by anti-communist forces in the us to " demonize " china , and jiang 's address to the un - which was very friendly in tone and was delivered in english - is widely believed to have effectively improved the negative image of china in the us .
at the end of september , the us congress passed a resolution granting the prc permanent normal trade relations , bringing the bilateral relationship another step forward . track two
jason hu , formerly foreign minister and now director of the department of cultural affairs in the kmt , warns that the us is already leaning toward the prc in the trilateral relationship .
the prc has been intensively lobbying the us on the principle of " one china , " and taiwan can not sit idly by .
in fact , the new government in taipei is aware of this point .
president chen has openly asked the united states to play a more active balancing role in the taiwan strait . lee ying - yuan , a dpp legislator who is tapped to be the next deputy representative of the roc in washington , states that at the moment the formal channels between taiwan and the us are functioning very smoothly , and that chen 's keeping of his promise to make an august stopover in los angeles very low - key has strengthened mutual trust between the us and the new government .
in addition , taiwan is trying to strengthen so - called " track two " communications between think tanks in the roc , prc , and us .
" think tanks have a considerable influence on government policies . strengthening contacts between the three sides would help mutual understanding , " says lee .
formal diplomatic partners
while the prc is deeply involved in taiwan 's relationship with the us , it has an even more immediate target : to break taiwan 's formal diplomatic relationships , which give taiwan the status of a sovereign country .
for many years now , the number of countries which recognize taiwan has been between 28 and 30 , with the current number being 29 .
however , recently the prc has been stepping up its pressure on roc diplomatic partners in latin america , africa , and the south pacific .
the book chinese foreign policy , the year 2000 specifically states that beijing is targeting taiwan 's diplomatic partners in central america - guatemala , honduras , el salvador , nicaragua , costa rica , panama , haiti , and the dominican republic - for upgrading of formal relationships . the book also mentions ways in which improvement in ties has taken place .
for example , says the book , last year relations between beijing and panama took a giant step forward , indicating that rumors in taipei about a possible break in relations with panama were not completely unfounded .
also , when chen shui - bian visited the dominican republic in august , the roc ambassador there reported that in 1997 , the prc managed to get the dominican republic 's agreement to the establishment of a prc office in the dr capital by playing on the dr 's desire to extend its consular rights in hong kong .
in africa , last year the prc tried very hard to get taiwan 's eight diplomatic partners on that continent to participate in the " sino - african cooperation forum " held in beijing in october . although ultimately all eight refused , the prc 's determination to strengthen interactions with these eight countries is unmistakable .
meanwhile , in the south pacific , there were gains and losses , with the roc losing its formal ties with tonga but gaining formal recognition from the marshall islands .
fish in water taiwan does not have many cards to play in developing formal diplomatic relationships . early on , taiwan 's agricultural technology and the dedication of its agricultural cooperation teams helped maintain relations with african and south pacific countries .
in recent years , taiwan 's economic power - including both financial assistance and overseas investment - has added another card to play .
nevertheless , taiwan 's foreign assistance programs have been a subject of considerable criticism at home .
in the past the democratic progressive party repeatedly attacked foreign aid , and the fact that the dpp now holds the presidency has n't reduced the general dissatisfaction with it . levi ying says that the old government gave out financial assistance " as if money grew on trees . "
yet the new government , which criticized this policy in the past , is following the same old path . " although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease - fire with communist china , today , when taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "
what is so important about financial assistance that both the old and the new administrations place such emphasis on it ?
former foreign minister jason hu defends foreign aid by arguing that there are two kinds of countries in the world : those that help and those that need help . in the past taiwan was a recipient of american aid , so now that taiwan has the economic power to return the favor to the international community , it should do so .
moreover , explains hu , " in fact the amount of money taiwan spends on foreign assistance is very limited .
currently the un asks that oecd countries try to spend 0.7 % of their gnp on foreign aid . although most countries do not reach this level , most spend at least 0.2 % . taiwan , on the other hand , is spending only about 0.1 % ! " since there is a basic obligation to help all countries in need , and taiwan is already doing less than it should , it is all the more understandable that taiwan gives aid to countries with which it has formal diplomatic relations .
jaw - ling joanne chang , a researcher at the institute of european and american studies at the academia sinica , says that the public needs to look at the issue from a new angle . relations between the roc and its diplomatic partners should be seen as mutually beneficial . taiwan 's diplomatic partners have economic needs , so we give financial assistance .
we have diplomatic problems , so our diplomatic partners support our entry into international organizations . each side gets something it needs , and the relationship can not be summed up as a purely financial one . chang continues : " it is shallow to see the maintenance of relations between the roc and its diplomatic partners as depending only on money .
ties with some latin american countries go back 40 or 50 years . such a long period of friendship can not be explained only by the size or wealth of the countries involved . " in fact , in recent years the prc has spent much larger sums of money than taiwan in trying to woo away the roc 's diplomatic partners . in addition , it often dangles its enormous domestic market before them as an inducement .
take for example the so - called " banana diplomacy " the prc employed toward costa rica three years ago .
attempting to take advantage of the fact that bananas are costa rica 's main export , the prc , through private channels , indicated that it would be willing to purchase costa rican bananas at a high price .
however , because the prc has no formal diplomatic relations with costa rica , they would have to add a 40 % customs tax . this was clearly an effort to use commercial incentives to force the costa rican government 's hand . as it turned out , costa rican bananas had been contracted out early to large corporations , and also some of the companies commissioned by the prc failed to pay up as promised , causing costa rican farmers to lose confidence in them .
as a result , the prc goal was not achieved . nonetheless , from this case you can see that prc diplomacy has been extended to cover the commercial field as well . learning from this , president chen says that taiwan must deepen its economic diplomacy . the government must take the lead in negotiating the construction of markets and the creation of business opportunities with other countries and international organizations .
meanwhile , businesses must collectively move to the front line . only in this way can a win - win situation for both diplomacy and trade be created . the problem is that taiwan has been engaged in economic diplomacy for many years now , yet the results are not particularly obvious . jason hu says that currently economic diplomacy has shown only limited results , but there are still areas where the new government can work harder . " the main thing the government can do is provide information and convenience .
this requires coordination among the government information office [ gio ] , moea , and foreign ministry .
yet , so far , only the gio has sent staff to diplomatic partners to coordinate , while the moea has not posted staff to all relevant overseas offices , " he says .
greater effort and creativity is needed in economic diplomacy , which in turn requires more study and discussion among the political parties , businessmen , and the academic community , as well as greater flexibility and coordination in the mofa and other government agencies . process vs. outcomes the number of roc diplomatic partners is far behind that of the prc , which seriously impedes taiwan 's efforts to take part in international organizations .
for international organizations of which the prc is already member , such as the united nations , although taiwan has repeatedly knocked at the door , it has met with repeated failure as a result of international pressure imposed by the prc under the " one china " principle .
as for the world trade organi - zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the prc has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to taiwan .
however , because negotiations with the united states on early prc entry have not reached a successful outcome , prc entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for roc entry .
in this age of the global village , international organizations are increasingly important . how much room to maneuver does taiwan have in this respect ?
lo chih - cheng , chairman of research and planning board at the mofa , believes that taiwan still has room to maneuver in terms of international economic organizations .
but as for the un and its affiliated organizations , such as the world health organization or unesco , the roc faces countless obstacles .
in fact , the roc is currently the only nation that enjoys sovereignty that is excluded from united nations .
when chen shui - bian visited costa rica in august , the president of that country , miguel angel rodriguez , indicated for the first time that his country would be willing to help taiwan enter the un . but he suggested that taiwan should reconsider its tactical approach ; otherwise repeated failure could cause people to lose interest and faith .
in fact , this has already happened in taiwan 's public , which has seen the un effort fail repeatedly . people are wondering whether something should be changed in the roc approach to the un . lo chih - cheng says that you can not only look at the results of efforts to enter the un - you also have to look at the significance of the process .
" applying for entry to the un demonstrates that taiwan is a sovereign state and is qualified to be a un member . this reminds the international community to be aware of taiwan 's existence . in addition , from the perspective of the foreign ministry , efforts to re-enter the un are not only excellent training for diplomatic personnel , but also provide a regular test of how secure relations are between the roc and its diplomatic partner states , " explains lo .
the prc worked for 21 years to gain entry to the un , while we have only been at it a few years . there 's no point in getting overanxious . it 's not impossible that the general environment will change . this year the roc application to the un particularly emphasized that the un could serve as a forum for the peaceful resolution of the cross-strait problem .
this increases international understanding of taiwan 's sincerity vis - a - vis the cross-strait and international relations issues .
flexible diplomacy looking at the overall diplomatic situation , the new government faces more challenges , not fewer .
that being the case , so far , how has the new foreign policy team been doing ?
joanne chang of the academia sinica says that although most people feel that the new government 's strategies - " diplomacy of the whole people , " economic diplomacy , and entry into nongovernmental organizations - differ little from the past , you must remember that diplomacy is a long - term game , and , in the details , the new foreign policy team has already brought in some fresh air .
for example , she notes , recently the mofa , through its " virtual diplomacy institute , " has begun offering a class in " diplomacy of the whole people " that provides training to legislative assistants , political party staff , and employees of nongovernmental organizations . the aim is to develop the capability to participate in international affairs among a wider public .
in addition , the government is continuing to encourage and assist private groups to participate in nongovernmental organizations , is eliminating the units abroad which have proven ineffective , and is promoting " human rights diplomacy . " all of these are new approaches in foreign affairs .
lo chih - cheng relates that , though there is no direct and immediate impact on inter-state relations as a result of private participation in nongovernmental organizations , nevertheless such participation can strengthen communication and contact between peoples .
the research and planning board intends to establish a special ngo subcommittee , led by the government , to provide information and practical assistance to domestic ngos in taiwan .
lo explains that in democratic countries , with whom taiwan would like to strengthen ties , public opinion is the source of policy direction . so over the long term , people - to - people contacts will definitely have a positive effect .
this is also the thinking behind the government 's advocacy of " human rights diplomacy . "
by emphasizing the government 's concern for human rights on the international stage , not only can taiwan make its own democratization experience available for other countries currently going through the same process , it can bring itself closer to those countries which also place a strong emphasis on human rights .
besides promoting new ideas , says lo , the mofa is also undertaking internal reform .
in early september the mofa announced that , based on efficiency evaluations , the government would close its representative offices in the african countries of the congo , angola , and madagascar .
as lo says , " the roc must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " in the future , overseas offices of the roc will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations .
all the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group . lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the roc 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of north america and europe .
" the academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented .
in the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with european and north american countries , " he says .
though in office for less than four months , foreign minister tien hung - mao has already been to europe twice . based on his comments , analysts infer that taiwan may in the near future establish formal diplomatic relations with another european country . soft diplomacy
following closely on president chen 's trip , in late september vice president annette lu traveled to central american countries that president chen could not fit into his itinerary , including el salvador , honduras , belize , and guatemala , all of which have formal diplomatic ties with taiwan .
this visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power . instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .
in contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , annette lu has emphasized " soft national power . "
before her departure she stated that taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high - technology , compassion , and peace .
if taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the united nations will turn around and want taiwan to join . diplomats are anxious for a breakthrough that will reverse negative trends .
but many people say that the root of the roc 's foreign policy difficulties is still in the relationship with the prc . right now the two sides are at an impasse . it is unlikely there will be any progress on diplomatic or cross-strait issues between the two sides . before departing on his trip , president chen repeatedly stressed that , despite the tremendous pressure coming from the mainland , there are other considerations in foreign policy .
indeed , says joanne chang , it is precisely because diplomatic and cross-strait issues are inextricably intertwined that foreign policy breakthroughs are needed .
if more states support taiwan , taipei will have more cards to play in cross-strait negotiations , and domestic morale will be bolstered and people 's fears alleviated . as president chen said , determination is power .
the global values espoused by taiwan , including democracy , human rights , love , and peace , are the real assets of roc diplomacy . the old saying has it that " a person of high morals will never be alone . " we now look with high hopes to the international community .
soldier ants : maysing yang calls for ngo mobilization
maysing yang , vice chair of the ministry of foreign affairs ' research and planning board , lived for many years in new york . she joined taiwan 's political opposition movement very early in her career , and for a time chaired the democratic progressive party 's foreign affairs committee .
after the dpp gained control of the central government , in view of yang 's long overseas experience of diplomatic affairs and the overseas chinese community , she was recruited into the cabinet to take over the important position of vice chair of the mofa 's research and planning board .
in late august 2000 , maysing yang and presidential advisor and former dpp chairman peng ming - min led a delegation to attend the 53rd annual dpi / ngo conference of the united nations department of public information . she became the first serving mofa official to enter the un headquarters building since the roc left the un .
when news of this got out , the prc delegation at the un immediately pro-tested , and demanded that the two should leave the conference chamber and be excluded from the un building .
the next day , showing commendable courage , yang and peng slipped back into the conference chamber .
but their actions also attracted the criticism that this kind of high - decibel display is not in fact helpful for achieving taiwan 's return to the united nations . however , yang does not subscribe to this view .
enthusiastic , outspoken and full of vitality , she is highly optimistic about taiwan 's prospects for participation in un - associated ngos , and believes that as temples of popular campaigning , ngos can develop the strength of the taiwanese people .
below she describes her views .
after the new government took office , apart from being briefed on our diplomatic partners and on countries with which we do n't have diplomatic relations , i also looked at civic organizations with which the mofa has contacts and which are frequently active in the international community . i discovered that the world league for freedom and democracy is a well - run international organization with a complete organizational structure , is a member of the un 's department of public information , and attends the annual dpi / ngo conference every year .
this year too it was planning to attend the millennium edition of the conference . therefore when professor peng invited me to attend , i agreed to join the delegation as an advisor to the league .
the mofa was very excited about my attending the conference , because we can say that this is the first time a mofa official has entered the un headquarters building in the last 30 years . everyone thought it was a great breakthrough .
i also took the opportunity to personally get an understanding of how the dpi / ngo conference works , and of the direction of mainstream international thinking , and i collected a lot of relevant information in the form of conference materials . thus we gained a great deal from attending .
one of the main topics at this year 's conference was the issue of how to go about monitoring how governments put into action their ideals and their promises to their peoples . another main focus of discussion was the partnership between ngos , national governments and the un itself .
these are all very important things for taiwan to be thinking about , so we ought to participate more .
the un itself is an organization of national governments . at present we are excluded , and that is very difficult to change . ngos represent a very good point of access .
today there are a tremendous number of ngos .
they hold frequent conferences , and they have an ever - growing influence on governments .
for example , a couple of months ago i went to warsaw to attend the international forum on democracy . the forum was attended by foreign ministers from over 100 countries , but it was also an ngo conference . those attending included the great american entrepreneur george soros , who funded the forum , the former us ambassador to beijing , winston lord , and so on - all high - ranking , highly influential people .
in other words , ngos are very broad church . retired diplomats , business - people , social campaigners , academics and all kinds of foundations may be involved in ngos . ngos can be more powerful than governments , so governments certainly ca n t afford to ignore them .
at present , apart from the world league for freedom and democracy , a number of other ngos in taiwan are associated with the un , including women 's , aboriginal and academic groups . we hope that in the future more groups will actively develop an international profile , and apply to register with the un .
another way people in taiwan can actively participate in international affairs is by encouraging people of ability and influence in society to apply to join the un 's own ngos , such as population , human rights , peace and environmental groups , so that they can contribute their knowledge , and at the same time let others better understand people from taiwan .
we are living in an age of people power , and the un is responding to the trends of our time . in the past , ngos merely played a monitoring role at the un , but now the trend is towards their involvement in policy implementation .
hence in our future approach to the un , besides continuing to press for admission by mobilizing our diplomatic partners to speak on our behalf , we should also actively seek to make the most of the power of our people .
in particular , in the age of the internet , universal values such as humanitarianism and human rights transcend the narrow confines of national boundaries and nationalism . the taiwan issue is one of basic human rights . in other words , the people of taiwan are being denied the right to speak and vote in international affairs .
we can use the internet to gain the support of international champions of justice .
furthermore , among taiwanese compatriots living overseas there are many who opposed the old government , but are willing to support the new . these people are excellent partners through whom we can participate in un ngos .
we should n't be afraid of the chinese communist regime 's attempts to suppress such activity . they wo n't last forever , and they ca n't discourage everyone who supports us .
administration accused of political surveillance the investigators reform association , which was formed in early september , set off a political firestorm by accusing the administration of following in the footsteps of its kuomintang predecessor by carrying out politically motivated surveillance of opposition figures in the name of national security .
the office of the president , national security bureau , ministry of justice , and investigation bureau have all denied the charges , and president chen stated , " i have never instructed security organs to carry out surveillance against specific individuals since assuming the presidency , and i have never even seen the so - called ' national security daily . ' "
the association has stuck to its guns , however , and insists that the situation has not improved . controversy continues to swirl .
for a government that stresses human rights , this is an issue that can not be ignored .
the ira leveled its accusations at a press conference called to announce the group 's formation on september 9 . in addition to expressing support for reform of the justice system 's intelligence gathering organs , the ira accused the new administration of carrying out surveillance of members of opposition parties and persons viewed as rivals to the president .
the administration has allegedly focused especially on kmt party chairman lien chan , people 's first party chairman james soong , dpp chairman frank hsieh , and taipei mayor ma ying - jeou .
ira deputy chairman su yu - chi stated that abuse of investigative powers continues unabated today .
explaining the " chain of command " behind the surveillance , su said that the office of the president usually gets the ball rolling with an explicit or implied command to the national security bureau -lrb- nsb -rrb- , which relays instructions to the ministry of justice investigation bureau -lrb- mjib -rrb- . most investigations focus on political information on members of opposition parties .
the ira has drafted a " law for neutrality and supervision of intelligence organs " in order to : -lrb- 1 -rrb- require that intelligence organs maintain strict political neutrality ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- define clear jurisdictional boundaries between different intelligence organs ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- ensure proper supervision of their activities .
the ira 's accusations have elicited strong reactions . taipei mayor ma ying - jeou was angered to learn that intelligence organs would abuse their power by carrying out political surveillance against the taipei city government . kmt chairman lien chan and pfp chairman james soong stated that surveillance of political parties runs counter to the spirit of democracy . dpp chairman frank hsieh also voiced concern , pointing out that when he recently canceled a proposed visit to xiamen the news media had access to confidential information related to the matter .
hsieh called on the president to explain how the information could have leaked . according to eugene chien , deputy secretary - general to the president , national security organs are required by law to collect and analyze information related to national security and cross-strait relations .
information and analyses are forwarded to the president for his reference , said chien , but no one focuses on particular individuals or political parties .
the nsb also released a statement stressing that the information it collects is mostly related to matters that affect national security or pose a potential national security threat . as for the accusation that the nsb carries out politically motivated surveillance , the nsb stated that " gathering intelligence on national affairs " is one of its legally defined responsibilities . to the extent that its investigations focus on political matters , what the nsb is concerned about is the government 's performance of its duties , maintenance of order during elections , and cross-strait relations .
the nsb said it never carries out surveillance of individuals . these statements have not allayed suspicions , however . in fact , they have actually stirred up further controversy .
drawing on the term " white terror , " which refers to political persecution carried out by the kmt government during the 38 - year period of martial law , the three main opposition parties in the legislature have criticized the new administration for carrying out a " green terror " campaign -lrb- a reference to the green color of the dpp flag -rrb- .
pfp spokesman sun ta - chien alleged that ten persons have been targeted for special attention , and said that information on their activities is delivered to the president in a report nicknamed the " national security daily . " chen shui - bian responded publicly to the charges for the first time in his monthly press conference on september 16 .
chen denied instructing security organs to carry out surveillance against specific individuals , and said that he has never seen the so - called " national security daily . "
he further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " at the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .
mjib director wang kuang - yu assured dpp legislators on september 18 that his organization will redefine its mission to eliminate the category of " intelligence gathering , " which has stirred up so much controversy . instead , said wang , the mjib will concentrate on " investigating criminal activities and countering the attempts of individuals -lrb- and organizations -rrb- from mainland china and foreign countries to infiltrate or spy on taiwan . " questions concerning the proper role and jurisdiction of the mjib have reopened public debate on political surveillance .
the mjib is responsible for both political intelligence gathering and criminal investigations , and is nominally under the ministry of justice .
its work overlaps with that of the nsb , and the existence of two different chains of command inevitably creates problems . the ira has pointed out , for example , that mjib investigators often receive oral instructions from the nsb to collect information on a particular political party .
the ministry of justice , in the meantime , repeatedly calls upon the mjib to stop doing work not related to national security or crime prevention , and demands that they maintain strict political neutrality . investigators complain that they do n't know who to listen to , and it is difficult for them to concentrate on their work and play their proper role in the justice system .
the intelligence apparatus is supposedly subject to supervision by the legislature , which wields budgetary authority over these agencies and has the power to review internal administrative documents that do not contain classified information .
in reality , however , intelligence operations are extremely secretive , and legislators can do little to hold them in check . taiwan now faces two very pressing tasks related to its intelligence operations .
the jurisdiction of the mjib , for one thing , must be clarified . and secondly , our domestic intelligence activities must be subject to effective oversight so that no government of any stripe will ever again engage in repression of its political opponents .
lee kuan yew visits taiwan
senior minister lee kuan yew of singapore came to taiwan on september 23 , and though he did not publicly comment on the purpose of his visit , observers everywhere speculated that he may have come as an intermediary between taipei and beijing . indeed , lee , who has been dubbed " the asian godfather , " played a key role in the early 1990s in bringing about the first round of talks between taiwan 's koo chen - fu and beijing 's wang daohan .
it remains to be seen whether lee 's visit will bring any change in sensitive cross-strait relations , but president chen shui - bian revealed after lee 's departure that he and his guest had reached three points of consensus , including the need for a singapore - taiwan free - trade zone .
lee 's four - day series of closed - door meetings in taiwan came to an end on september 26 .
he met twice with president chen shui - bian and had numerous contacts with a wide range of other leading members of taiwan society , including tang fei -lrb- premier -rrb- , tsai ing - wen -lrb- mainland affairs council [ mac ] chairwoman -rrb- , the three mac vice chairmen , shi huei - yow -lrb- straits exchange foundation [ sef ] vice chairman -rrb- , chuang ming - yao -lrb- national security council [ nsc ] secretary - general , chiou i - jen -lrb- sef deputy secretary - general -rrb- , lee yuan - tseh -lrb- chairman of the presidential office 's inter-party task force for policy coordination -rrb- , and nita ing -lrb- chairwoman of taiwan high - speed rail corporation -rrb- .
lee also held in - depth discussions with kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- chairman lien chan and people first party -lrb- pfp -rrb- chairman james soong . although no one is saying so , it seems clear that lee 's visit focused primarily on cross-strait relations .
as one of the most senior politicians in the asian region , and a man who has had close ties with several generations of leaders on both sides of the taiwan strait , lee kuan yew maintains a special status in both taiwan and mainland china . the news media have even taken to calling him a cross-strait mediator .
lee said that the purpose of his whirlwind visit was only to get a first - hand feel for the new administration .
" i was never a cross-strait mediator , " he stated categorically , " and i 've never said that i was . "
mac vice chairman chen ming - tung sounded a similar note during interpellations at the legislature . when asked whether lee kuan yew had come as beijing 's emissary , chen said , " i can guarantee that he has not . "
tsai ing - wen , who met twice with lee during his brief stay , added that lee has considerable political stature in asia and around the world , and his concern about cross-strait relations and the direction of policy in this regard is helpful to taiwan .
beijing has also commented favorably on lee 's visit . prc foreign ministry spokesman sun yuxi stated that while the taiwan issue is china 's internal matter , it welcomes efforts by anyone who upholds the " one china " principle to bring about an early resolution .
it would thus appear that lee 's visit was welcomed by leaders on both sides of the taiwan strait , but in fact the two sides did not actually share a common view on the matter .
taiwan 's top concern was peace and stability , while mainland china continually brought up the theme of unification .
although lee 's trip would seem to have been a shot in the arm for the deadlocked cross-strait relationship , it also generated a lot of speculation and ill will because neither lee nor anyone who met with him was willing to say a word about the content of their discussions , and roc officials who went to call on lee at his hotel skulked around in underground walkways and service elevators to avoid journalists .
lee 's stay in taiwan certainly left the roc ministry of foreign affairs -lrb- mofa -rrb- with a bad taste in its mouth , for the mofa was not involved in the visit in any way , and was n't even aware in advance that it was in the works . that seemed quite odd , considering that lee is the founding father of singapore and is still active as senior minister .
many commentators blasted the way the visit was handled , and legislators described the affair as a serious breach of protocol .
foreign minister tien hung - mao was quoted as saying , " i feel a bit kicked around . " president chen broke the silence after lee left , stating at a function in honor of model public servants that he and lee kuan yew had reached three agreements , namely that singapore and taiwan should : -lrb- 1 -rrb- sign a " singapore - taiwan free trade zone agreement " ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- lend impetus to financial cooperation , especially a possible exchange rate agreement ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- effect telecommunication and internet alliances .
president chen further stated that after taiwan joins the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , taiwan and singapore , as fellow members of that select group of economic overachievers that journalists have come to dub " the four tigers , " should stop viewing each other as competitors and move toward a friendly division of labor .
president chen also stressed : " senior minister lee is not a mediator . he is not pushing any particular viewpoint , and he is no one 's mouthpiece . "
cross-strait relations , said chen , were just one of many issues that he discussed with lee .
it may be that the pursuit of economic and trade relations is the only way to get taiwan and mainland china onto the path toward a resolution of the cross-strait stalemate . separate entry into the wto by taiwan and mainland china may be the best opportunity for the two sides to settle upon a " no unification , no independence " modus vivendi .
it seems apparent that mainland china is the only place where taiwan 's traditional industries can survive . even high - tech industries are slowly making their way to the prc .
uncertainty in cross-strait relations will inevitably hurt taiwan 's economy .
lee kuan yew describes the debate between " one china " versus " one china as a point for discussion " and other such issues as mere semantics , and says that only history can bring the cross-strait issue to a resolution .
in the second half of his memoirs , which were published in taiwan in september , lee writes : " chinese people on both sides of the taiwan strait can reduce friction by building a relationship that is a bit more acceptable to both sides . " we ought to use lee 's visit as an opportunity to take stock of our current situation and further clarify our policy vis - a - vis mainland china , thereby bringing about an improvement in cross-strait relations .
therein lies the most concrete significance of lee 's trip .
new rules for tech startups -lrb- cyril chiang / graphics by tsai chih - pen / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb-
in the past few years the internet has helped to create a " new economy " that has both created technological fortunes and rewritten the postulates of traditional economic development .
microsoft 's bill gates did n't make his money out of land or gold or oil , and he did n't make it from machines or factory goods .
rather , what he had at his disposal was a method of organizing knowledge .
precisely because entrepreneurs no longer need land or financial assets , the bar has never been lower for what is needed to build a successful company . yet it 's worth noting that the rate of success has also never been lower .
if you want to get investors to open their wallets in this new economic age , then you 've got to have a handle on some key points .
if investors ' eyes have n't brightened in three minutes , it 's all over . those hoping to build up a new company have got to know how to capture investors ' attention in the shortest possible time .
what is the right thing to say ?
how should you say it ?
the following 13 questions are what investors are most concerned about .
if you can focus on these 13 points of business startup logic and then add your own creative vision and arguments , then you 've probably taken your first step to success !
question # 1 : how do you define your business ?
successfully defining a business is a process of elimination .
in the late 1980s , intel realized that it could no longer compete with japanese semiconductor companies in the production of memory chips , so it left that market , believing that it would only be able to break free from japanese competition by focusing on its specialty of microprocessors . it is now a larger company many times over . this is a story of how " loss " can turn into " gain . "
" elimination " suggests paring down .
the more clearly a company is defined , the more limited will be its operational scope .
but just about any successful company has a clear sense of its limitations , because otherwise it would n't be able to differentiate itself in the marketplace and reduce its vulnerablility to price wars . consequently , it is essential to pay attention to the following points :
1. no matter how complex your company , it must have a basic conception that is clear and easy to understand . 2. the company 's definition is a reflection of its operational strategies . 3. an unclear company definition represents unclear operational strategies . 4. you 've got to clearly define your role based on the value of your products and services and get the consumer to understand what makes you better . 5. differentiation is good and works to your advantage .
question 2 : what is your executive summary ?
an executive summary serves as a preface to an investment or business plan . it needs to faithfully reflect the special qualities and values of the entire plan in as few words as possible .
as far as investors are concerned , a clear , easy - to - read two - page summary is much better than a tedious 200 - page plan .
steve jurvetson , managing director of the silicon valley venture capital firm draper , fisher , and jurvetson , says : " an executive summary is n't a financial contract ; it 's a story . a story has to have drama and flesh - and - blood people . for an executive summary , i 've never used excel , and i 've never talked about models for the financial structure . i always spend my time thinking about how big a story it could become . "
therefore , you 've got to pay attention to the following : 1. the executive summary is the one chance you have to get investors interested in investing in your company . 2. focus on selling your plan . 3. get right to the point . do n't think of it as a literary competition . 4. in an orderly fashion , describe " the market , the management team , the finances and the technology . "
question # 3 : what 's the justification for this business ?
the japanese management guru matsushita konosuke has said , " do n't sell customers things they find attractive , sell them things they find useful . " investors have a lot of different cards they can play , so they 've got to know why your business plan is worth pursuing . why now ? why you ? consequently , you must consider the following points :
1. why should this be done ? why should you do it ? why now ?
2. the dollar sign -lrb- $ -rrb- is capitalism 's lingua franca . 3. the market will decide whether your plan is justifiable . question # 4 : how much risk are you willing to take on ?
are you willing to risk failure ?
when you try to get people to invest in a new venture , there will invariably be one question that each and every one of those potential investors will have in mind : " you want to put my money at risk , but what kind of risk are you taking ? "
investors hope that the entrepreneur is taking equal risk , because only with commensurate risk will the two sides cooperate unselfishly .
therefore , the entrepreneur must be very clear about the risk and the possibility of losing the investment . what follows are the values of a silicon valley new - age knowledge - based business creator :
1. a failure is like the south in the american civil war . it 's history ; move on .
2. those who have experience beat those who lack experience , and failure counts as experience .
3. your past failure is your mba from the school of hard knocks .
4. failure is not rare or unusual . you will only be successful by continuing to try .
you 've got to be careful about the following : 1. the investor and entrepreneur have to be taking similar risks if they are to cooperate selflessly . 2. have you already put in time and money ? 3. are you willing to forgo the security of a stable job and income ? 4. you can not pack a parachute and be thinking of a safe way to bail . 5. having failed previously with startups does not mean a person is a loser .
question # 5 : what are your company goals and business model ?
morris chang , chairman of taiwan semiconductor , believes that a company 's core staff ought to be on the same page . they should share the same vision for the company and fit into its corporate culture . the company goals should n't be pie - in - the - sky dreams .
since the company has got to crystallize the investors ' and staff 's talents and energies , its vision for the future has to be attainable .
apart from having a vision for the future , a company also needs a business model .
the business model is the way that the company plans to attain its goals .
a good business model can even realize visions of the future that seem impossible .
priceline.com , the first american company to sell airline tickets directly over the internet , surpassed the combined market capitalization of the three largest us airlines -lrb- united , american and delta -rrb- after only two years of operations .
the three airlines have a total of 1,400 jets , whereas priceline only has computers and network servers . the key to its success was its business plan .
therefore , you have to consider the following : 1. how do you outline where the company will be in three to five years ? this is the company 's vision . 2. how do you realize the company 's vision ?
this is the business model .
3. the company 's vision is built on faith , and it requires the possibility of realization . 4. once the company 's vision is defined , one should n't change it lightly .
the business model on the other hand can be constantly adapted in accordance with circumstances . question # 6 : how do you present your technology and service ?
introducing the company 's technology to investors is something that the company founder should be very familiar with , but it is also is the source of conflicting feelings .
how should a founder of a start - up go about explaining its technology so that investors can understand it without getting so detailed as to reveal company secrets ? here are some recommendations : 1. you have to be able both to describe your innovation and protect your own intellectual property . 2. do n't request a non-disclosure agreement , because this is unprofessional . 3. investors are not intent on stealing your ideas . instead they want to see that you can justify them .
question # 7 : what sort of problems do you want to solve ?
what problems is your company plan trying to solve ?
if you ca n't answer this clearly , then maybe you should be worrying about your future .
taiwanese entrepreneurs are facing the problem of having an incomplete chain of value , which is a result of their customers handling the activities with the greatest added value .
this is a result of the problem , not its cause !
the real problem is that entrepreneurs in taiwan do not make clear enough definitions when trying to resolve a problem , or they narrowly look at " manufacturing " as a way of solving the problem . raising one 's ability to innovate means raising one 's ability to solve problems .
this leads us to the following conclusions :
1. finding a solution is finding a profitable market base . 2. you can only solve the problem by finding the problem . 3. put your energies into solving today 's problems . 4. the problems created by your actions should not exceed the problems solved .
question # 8 : is the team complete ? who is missing ?
founders of startups will always build their own management team , and they almost always start with people around them and then move on to attract personnel from outside .
this creates a blind spot in the structure , with like - minded people grouped together .
investors like to hear entrepreneurs say that their teams are incomplete , because it shows that they have a practical mentality , and that they are aware of and willing to face their own shortcomings .
good investors ought to maintain a mutually supportive relationship with the management team , but the investors are certainly not just the management team 's rubber stamp .
as a start - up founder , you ought to clearly understand that you are providing your knowledge and youth and the investors are providing their money .
the investors have no reason to want to handicap the entrepreneur .
in other words , there should be a supportive relationship between the investors and the management team , rather than an obstructive one .
we urge those who are creating a startup to understand where you come up short and be willing to ask for help .
question # 9 : where are your customers ?
how do you get hold of them ? to answer this question , you 've got to focus on your " market segment . "
secondly , you should analyze why customers in your market segment would like to do business with you .
you 've also got to consider how to prevent competitors from taking customers within the same market segment or how to effectively create entry barriers , so that you will be able to maintain a competitive advantage for as long as possible .
a price war is the simplest strategy , but consequently its effects are the most limited . you should instead consider how to avoid the slippery slope of price wars .
what 's more , if you find that major changes in your sector are usually coming from other people 's customers , you should realize that they probably are n't your customers because they do n't need your products or can get something better .
to figure out why , you 've got to remind yourself to do the following : 1. focus your attention on the market segment . 2. a good product or service will actively create a market segment and find customers that did n't previously exist . 3. of course , any customer of yours sees some value in you . how they value you determines their expectations of you . 4. do n't forget about " non-customers . " do n't fall into the trap of thinking that you understand everything about the industry .
question # 10 : where are your competitors ?
please do n't say that you have no competitors .
perhaps you have no competitors today , but you will have them tomorrow .
and if you really do n't have weighty competitors , then your competitor is yourself . entry barriers and exit barriers have opposite effects . the former determines if there will be a swarm of competitors .
-lrb- if entry barriers are low , anyone can compete . -rrb- the latter determines whether there will be detrimental competition . -lrb- if exit barriers are high , competitors will fight to the last penny . -rrb-
if you want to maintain core compet - itiveness , the first thing you 've got to do is to eliminate business that does not relate to your core competencies . furthermore , you should put the emphasis on innovation and strategic management .
please remember : 1. when you analyze entry barriers , you should also analyze exit barriers . 2. you should focus on your " core competencies . " 3. you should use core personnel , develop core technology and attain core goals .
question # 11 : what is your market share ?
in america telephones reached 90 % of households in 50 years , whereas it only took video recorders 18 years to do the same .
today , new technological products and services are unlikely even to be around that long .
if technological entrepreneurs do not move forward , they fall behind .
developing the company -lrb- and extremely fast at that -rrb- is a road that must be taken , and market share is an indication of the speed of the company 's development .
the " killer " strategy must combine " quickly changing the rules of the game " with management thinking that is characterized by a " willingness to take risks , " " unconventionality , " and " a determination to become the standard . " your determination as the founder of the company is all - important . you 've got to pay attention to the following :
1. how should your company prepare to develop quickly ? 2. not only must you advance technologically if you are not to fall behind , but you must also develop quickly . 3. there is a fine line between ambition and wishful thinking . 4. the underlying logic is more important than the results .
question # 12 : when will you break even ? how do you read financial clues ? how do you transform your company ?
in the internet economy , companies that are not among the leaders are going to have a rough go of it .
therefore , merging -lrb- or being acquired -rrb- at the right price is more important than staying in business forever .
in order to prepare for a merger at any moment , financial officers must get used to the idea that " the company itself is its our biggest product . "
in the past , financial officers focused on cost management , cash flow , capital movement and risk avoidance .
from now on , looking at these wo n't be enough , and financial officers ought to turn their attention to mergers and raising capital .
if you want to raise capital , you 've got to explain how it is going to be used .
if you are going to pursue acquisitions , you have to evaluate assets . traditionally you raised capital in order to expand the scope of your business .
internet companies , on the other hand , raise capital to increase the value of the company before acquiring or being acquired . value in the internet economy is determined by the business model . it is very possible that the a company will lack tangible assets upon which to evaluate worth .
as a result , " reading the value of the business plan " has to take the place of the traditional work of checking the books .
the value of the business model is in looking toward the future , not the present , and as a result most mergers take the form of stock swaps so as to preserve cash reserves .
in order to obtain the best rate of exchange , it is important to be traded on the market as soon as possible .
with this lack of clarity , " breaking even " becomes the ultimate financial indicator . this series of changes has had a huge impact on financial officers .
the founder of a startup must : 1. pay attention to cash and cash flow . 2. forget about staying in business forever . be prepared at all times to sell the company for the highest profit .
question # 13 : how should a startup entrepreneur handle communications and the media ?
communication and media skills are certainly no less important than technology for a startup company . the professional managers of listed companies frequently come face to face with non-professionals .
speaking to the media is just one example . with regard to communication and the media , the main things to do are to simplify and speak in language that your listeners will understand .
excellent communicators first of all know how to " listen , " and secondly can think logically and learn quickly .
you 've got to take an open and objective attitude in order to understand the background of a question , and then respond by focusing on the questioner 's needs .
you must never force others to dance at your expert pace .
do n't overestimate your listeners ' specialized knowledge , but do n't underestimate their general intelligence .
from the very beginning , founders of startups have got to get into the habit of :
1. cultivating explanation skills , so that you can explain specialized knowledge to non-specialists and they can get the gist .
2. practicing how best to communicate . citing a good example is usually the best way to explain something .
guy kawasaki , founder of garage.com , the largest us company focusing on attracting venture capital for startups , has long been famous in silicon valley for his entrepreneurial enthusiasm . in a speech he delivered in the us in may he outlined the main points in his vision of new - age entre - preneurialism :
in the 19th century , companies in the ice business would send people to frozen lakes or rivers to saw up the ice . these companies were replaced by ice making factories . then refrigerators replaced ice factories .
if these businessmen had embraced change instead of resisting it , they would have had an opportunity to move into a new technological field - rather than just watching helplessly as others took over what was once their domain .
change is the only constant on the way to success !
taipei city : sweating in the spotlight recently the taipei city department of urban development announced their idea for a " taipei citizen 's passport . " who is their idea of a typical taipei citizen ?
the answer is an environmentally conscious , culture - loving person who has a soft spot in their heart for good causes - someone who reads several books a month , recycles , takes mass transit , donates blood , does volunteer work , plants flowers on their balcony and cleans their building 's exterior walls .
that 's who ! this " passport , " with its middle - class and decidedly western sensibility , is just one example of how taipei differs from other places in taiwan .
not long after chen shui - bian ascended to the roc presidency , the office of the president began to come into sharp conflict with taipei city hall .
they clashed over whether to build a domed stadium , over how to allocate government funds , over which romanization system should be employed to transcribe chinese characters , and even over whether the mayor was showing the president proper respect . these conflicts have caused taipei city to become isolated from taiwan 's other cities and counties .
what exactly is at the heart of these disputes ?
is there a north - south divide between taipei and the other counties and cities ?
and are the calls of " taipei first " and of " taiwan first " mutually reinforcing or mutually exclusive ? taipei 's wealth and high status as the capital have long been a sore spot with many people living elsewhere in taiwan .
some argue that taiwan ought to be divided into four counties by the chuoshui river and the central mountain range , with financial resources being equitably divided to create uniform levels of development in each .
others question whether the central government should be located at the northern tip of the island , making it difficult to reach for civil servants and regular citizens alike .
why not instead move the capital to taichung , they suggest .
since the taiwan provincial government was largely disbanded two years ago , the 21 counties and cities of taiwan have been directly under the roc central government . with the election of chen shui - bian , the roc is now under the control of the democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- , as are many of taiwan 's other cities and counties , including kaohsiung , which like taipei enjoys special status as a " self - governing municipality . "
whereas the south was chen 's principal source of votes , the blue of the kmt holds sway in taipei , making the city a thorn in the side of the ruling dpp and threatening its privileged position . in july the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by nt$ 6 billion . then in october the executive yuan lowered the population requirement for self - governing status , and taichung city joined taipei and kaohsiung as a special self - administered municipality .
various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as taipei . the goose that lays the golden eggs
is taipei really specially blessed ?
why is it the focus of so much attention , of so much envy and jealousy ?
perhaps the following figures can help shed some light on this matter :
the taipei basin holds 12 % of the island 's population on only 0.8 % of its land , yet it has one - sixth of the nation 's high schools , one - third of its universities , and 54 % of its cultural activities .
at least 75 % of all medium and large international conferences in taiwan are held in taipei . more than 90 % of multinationals in taiwan have their headquarters in taipei . and among the 100 largest domestic companies , more than 70 are registered in the city and pay their business taxes there . of the remaining , 10 can be found in the hsinchu science park .
whereas numerous factories are spread throughout central and southern taiwan , most are just producing for somewhere else . for these areas , a taiwanese expression captures the situation pretty well : " the hens produce droppings but lay no eggs . " as far as the distribution of government largess is concerned , in 1998 government expenditures in taipei city ran to about nt$ 176 billion -
that 's three times more than in kaohsiung city and more than in taichung city , miaoli county , taichung county , changhua county , nantou county and yunlin county combined . those six localities only received nt$ 120 billion in total . if expenditures were divided evenly among all the residents of taipei city , each would receive nt$ 68,000 , far above the nt$ 42,000 for the residents of kaohsiung , the nt$ 25,000 for residents of tainan city or the nt$ 17,000 for the residents of taipei county .
in light of this discrepancy , it 's no wonder that the other counties and cities angrily look upon the residents of taipei as " first - class citizens " who live in the lap of luxury , while taking everyone else for a ride .
these first - class citizens really do run through money like water . if you want to see how , you could start with taipei 's mass rapid transit -lrb- mrt -rrb- system , which is the world 's most expensive at nt$ 440 billion ; the kuandu nature reserve , for which japanese experts were hired to perform wetlands restoration to the tune of nt$ 14 billion ; the west gate district reconstruction carried out in conjunction with the building of the mrt there , which came to more than nt$ 10 billion ; the mucha zoo , which has consumed nt$ 30 billion since it was built in the 1970s ; or the building of the taipei financial center , which will stand 101 stories high , serve as an asian landmark , and cost the city as much as nt$ 10 billion .
two heads , north and south this easy - come , easy - go attitude toward money has long been a characteristic of taipei .
ever since liu mingchuan founded taipei in the late qing dynasty , rule over taiwan has switched from nation to nation . yet no matter who was in control , taipei has not been shaken from its position as the island 's center of government .
nevertheless , " it has only been ten some years that taipei has really left the others in the dust , " argues hsia chu - joe , a professor at ntu 's graduate institute of building and planning .
hsia points out that although the governor - general 's residence was located in taipei during japanese rule , in the agricultural taiwan of that period , the japanese colonial administration was concerned about rice and sugar production over the entire western plain and treated all the cities about the same .
moreover , at the end of the japanese era , japan began to put even more emphasis on kaohsiung as a base for its advances into the south pacific . this gave the impetus for kaohsiung later developing into an " industrial port city . " when the roc took over , government power returned to the governor - general 's residence in taipei , which became the presidential palace .
although taipei remained the political and economic center , kaohsiung remained as an important center of heavy industry .
export processing zones established in the 1960s in nantzu and chienchen attracted people from all over southern taiwan . in the 1970s , during the era of the ten construction projects , both china shipbuilding and china steel chose to locate in kaohsiung .
at one point , the city 's port was the busiest in the world , as it sent products " made in taiwan " across the seven seas .
it thus made a pivotal contribution to taiwan 's " economic miracle . " with the rise of industry in kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . "
and to some degree the provincial government 's location in nantou - and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats - meant that central taiwan was n't all that forlorn . taichung and kaohsiung step out !
well then , when did taipei really start to pull ahead ? and why ? hsia chiu - joe explains that the late 1980s were an important turning point . the rapid appreciation of the nt dollar necessitated a shift from the labor - intensive production on which the island had depended .
japanese and western manufacturers left , and even taiwanese companies began to pull up their stakes and move their factories to southeast asia and mainland china .
what 's more , there was a growing environmental consciousness that led the residents of central and southern taiwan to start opposing industrial projects .
ten years ago the town of lukang in changhua county told du pont to look elsewhere , and three years ago taichung county refused to allow bayer to build a plant there .
as a result , other multinationals planning major investment projects stopped even considering taiwan . "
in fact , what kaohsiung people want most of all is the ' three direct links ' with mainland china , " says huang jung - feng , the director - general of taipei 's department of reconstruction , who worked for the kaohsiung city government for many years . " with regularly scheduled flights , kaohsiung could turn itself into an international port led by its service industries . "
likewise , lai cheng - i , chairman of the taiwan province association of real estate investors , which is headquartered in central taiwan , recalls that ten years ago the taichung city government drew up a new plan for the city that called for straight , broad avenues . many businesses were privately expecting that the port of taichung would be able to establish direct shipping links with the mainland , and were even hoping to attract " red capital " from across the strait . they had visions of taichung establishing important links to the asia pacific or even to the global community .
much to these cities ' frustration , for ten years there has been no progress on the " three direct links . " kaohsiung and taichung have excellent ports , but they are like besieged cities with nowhere to go . three years ago the tuntex building was completed in kaohsiung .
at 81 stories it is one of the tallest skyscrapers in asia . yet a series of rumors circling about its precarious financial status have turned it into a symbol of kaohsiung 's falling fortunes . high - tech corridor while southern and central taiwan have fallen on hard times , taipei city has taken full advantage of the 1990s trend toward globalized production .
" there is first of all taipei 's position of importance both for the economy and for government , and the thriving science park in hsinchu , " explains hsia chu - chiu , who is a professor of architecture and urban planning at ntu .
" to these you add the international airport in taoyuan and the construction of the second northern highway , and what you get is a ' high - tech corridor ' from taipei to hsinchu . " hsia points out that this corridor extends overseas , eastward to california 's silicon valley and westward to the production bases in the pearl and yangtze river deltas on the mainland . taipei , however , plays a pivotal role in the middle , linking all the parts together .
" if you eat somewhere like the agora garden conference center , you 'll hear people all around you saying things like , ' have you been abroad recently ? ' or ' i 've just come back from overseas , ' " says yang ting - yuan , the former general manager of winbond electronic 's semiconductor subsidiary .
the outstanding performance of northern taiwan 's high - tech corridor is driving the taiwan economy and widening the gap between north and south .
given this situation , where is there leverage to bring about a better balance between north and south ?
any such attempt will hinge upon the central government working to redistribute wealth - to take from rich taipei and give to its poor country cousins . how much would such action actually help ?
although redirecting some of the billions appropriated for taipei city would do little to fundamentally change the economic disparity , many experts believe that it would at least serve as a comforting gesture to the various counties and cities crying for help . but it would not get to the root of the problem .
" if you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self - rule , ' so that the local governments -lrb- which are now only tertiary government units -rrb- really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues hsia chu - joe .
otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in tainan county is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high - speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern taiwan . knowing new york better than hualien
a city can thrive or wilt in response to political and economic changes to a nation . these developments can even slowly and silently change its basic character .
taipei 's character is much different than those of other taiwanese cities . " in attitude , taipei is like a different country from central and southern taiwan , " observes chen tung - sheng , chairman of ntu 's sociology department , and a member of the democratic progressive party 's brain trust .
first of all , while most counties and cities regard the central government as the boss and taipei as the imaginary enemy , only taipei has an " international outlook . "
chen points out that every year more than 900,000 residents of taipei - or more than 30 % of its population - travel overseas .
hsinchu comes in second at 28 % .
by way of comparison , only 6 % of tainan residents and 5.4 % of kaohsiung residents go abroad every year .
every winter and summer vacation chen 's kids go overseas to study english . but the chens are just another middle - class yuppie family in taipei . " taipei youth may well know more about the latest fashions in tokyo and new york than about yunlin or hualien , " notes chen .
you can see one example after another of how taipei has its eyes on the world and fingers on the global pulse . at the beginning of september , the taipei city government broke new ground by sponsoring a gay pride festival .
it even invited michael bronski , a leader of the gay pride movement in the united states .
the event was fiercely opposed by the presbyterian church and other groups in taiwan , but it clearly earned points with foreigners who participated enthusiastically and saw it as an embrace of tolerance and diversity .
" the fact is that taiwan puts a lot of effort every year into providing foreign assistance and sending the head of state overseas , but we forget that we engage in foreign relations with our everyday actions , " says cheng tsun - chi , who is director of taipei 's bureau of labor affairs . more than 30,000 foreign workers , mostly filipino or indonesian nannies and nurses , live in taipei .
" about 10,000 of these foreign domestics leave every year when their contracts expire . if these 10,000 people dislike taiwan , their opinions will get passed around by word of mouth when they return home . what hope will there then be for taiwan 's foreign relations ? "
last year cheng tsun - chi put on a big event for foreign workers , and this year he has created an english newsletter for foreign workers . says cheng : " guests from afar should be treated with respect - not only to show that taipei is serious about becoming an international city , but also because these visitors are one of the links taipei has to other international cities . " not losing face for the nation
" taipei is under a lot of pressure because it faces international competition , " says william chen , the head of taipei 's bureau of urban development . when multinationals are deciding where to put their regional headquarters they make city - to - city comparisons .
last december the english - language magazine asia week made a list of asian cities that put taipei and osaka in a tie for second place among the most livable cities in asia , behind only fukuoka . taipei was up three places from the year before . nevertheless , since the chart changes year to year , taipei could slip in the future if it is n't careful .
" taipei is struggling to catch up with tokyo , singapore and hong kong , and it has cities like shanghai , beijing , and bangkok running fast on its heels , " says chen .
chen points out that with the prc lavishing resources on shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years . it was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network . " in terms of quality and diversity , taipei is ahead , but it 's a step behind when it comes to bringing out the pickaxes for an infrastructure project , " chen admits .
for instance , there has long been talk about installing a proper sewage treatment system in taipei , but currently only 43 % of taipei homes are connected to it . the sewage from most taipei homes pours out , untreated , into rivers . the capitals of the advanced western nations would never have allowed such a situation to persist . the residents of taipei regard themselves as citizens of the " global village , " and are confident in facing international challenges .
as a result , they find it hard to accept the current government 's " taiwan - first " orientation and its focus on the " native soil . " recently , there has been a big controversy about which romanization system to use for writing chinese characters in english .
the roc government insists on casting aside the hanyu pinyin system that has been used on the mainland and around the world for many years and instead adopting the tongyong pinyin system , which has been specially created by a taiwanese scholar . this has raised the hackles of lung ying - tai , the director of the taipei bureau of culture : " the new government can not try to lock up the nation . it can not put the elimination of pan-chinese influences as the starting point for all its thinking ! "
not talking the talk
with its international orientation , taipei also has a much different attitude than other counties and cities , especially southern ones , when it comes to the issue of independence versus reunification .
" over 30 % of taipei 's population is made up of mainlanders [ those who fled the chinese communists , and their descendants ] , " explains chen tung - sheng . " this figure is much higher than the 13 % average in the nation . "
the mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the kmt have also taken firm root in taipei . what 's more , a larger proportion of hakkas live in taipei than any place outside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . with this population structure , the taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern taiwan is rather rare in taipei .
oddly , as taipei has gone out of its way to establish ties with the international community and trade with mainland china , it has , whether by intention or not , created distance between itself and the rest of taiwan .
chen tung - sheng , who grew up in shalu , taichung county and has a strong taiwanese consciousness , remarks that you simply ca n't get by without speaking taiwanese south of the chuoshui river . only in taipei do people dare to " eat taiwanese , but not speak taiwanese . " both in terms of language and national identity , there is a clear " split between north and south . "
to take the simplest example , current roc president chen shui - bian had an outstanding record as mayor of taipei . moreover , he wore the mantle of being a " taiwanese native son . " in any other county or city , his re-election would have been a sure thing . but in the 1998 mayoral election , he lost by more than 100,000 votes to ma ying - jeou , whose parents came over from the mainland .
the year that he lost , chen magnanimously said , " a first - rate city is bound to be a very picky city . " he did so to show that he bore no grudge , but perhaps his statement was also a harbinger of the current animosity between the president 's office and city hall . new hometown in the eyes of the other counties and cities , taipei may stand alone , but taipei people themselves struggle with their sense of identity .
" taipei is a classic immigrant city , whose citizens form a ' motley crew , ' " says tseng shu - cheng , head of the urban reconstruction organization and an associate professor of architecture at tamkang university .
" its citizens may all earn their living here , but they do n't share collective memories , and they lack any bonds of affection to the city or ties to personal networks here . " in a survey he conducted several years ago , tseng found that only one in five taipei residents were born there .
" ask somebody in taipei where they are from , and seven out of ten will say they are mainlanders or are from tainan , pingtung , penghu or wherever . they are practically always from somewhere else ! "
in tseng 's view the coming decade will be key to determine whether the city can transform itself from a " city of immigrants and migrants " to a " city of residents . " he is currently promoting a community development plan in the hope that neighborhoods full of strangers can pull together , and people living in taipei can begin to regard it as their " new hometown . "
but does tseng himself consider taipei to be his " new hometown " ? " as a matter of fact , i feel very conflicted , " he admits .
" if i do n't move back to my hometown within five years , i 'll probably never return . " tseng , who strongly identifies with tainan county as the place where he grew up , goes back every month to visit his parents .
in his hometown there are 20,000 people , and only two elementary schools and one junior high school .
there , if a neighbor is n't a relative , he 's probably an old school chum or co-worker . you really get a hometown feeling in a place like that . but can tainan provide him with career opportunities ?
wo n't his children lose the educational race before it even begins ?
he has seen a syndrome play out there : people 's parents die , and then they sell their farmland , let their family home go to ruin , pull up their stakes and move to taipei . because he knows that his hometown needs people like him to come back and work on its behalf , he really feels torn . missions impossible
" while many cities and counties want to rediscover their old sense of self , taipei wants to invent a self - identity that it never had , " explains tseng , getting at the crux of the difference .
and so , at the beginning of the year before last , taipei city began instituting a system of " community planning masters . " these unpaid volunteers selected by city hall gather suggestions and criticisms from residents and communicate with the elected neighborhood chiefs . then , after establishing concrete plans , they can apply to the city for financial assistance to implement them . the goal is to get the citizens involved , so that they can help create a taipei that they feel belongs to them .
" over the past two years , we have discovered that taipei city is not nearly as cold and lonely as we had once imagined , " says william chen with excitement . in order to expand participation , the city 's urban development department this year has begun to train " seed planning masters . " two - thirds of the 48 " seed students " are professionals , including seven who have doctorates .
the high quality of people in taipei has startled chen , who worked for a long time in the provincial government . the people of taipei can be proud of their high level of education and earnings and their discipline .
when chen shui - bian was mayor he launched a major campaign against the sex industry , enforced laws against drinking and driving , and required motorcycle drivers to wear helmets .
even taipei residents themselves were surprised at their ability to accept such high standards . since ma ying - jeou has taken over as mayor the city has required its citizens to take on another duty , which was formerly regarded as a " mission impossible " : recycling in conjunction with using high - priced officially approved garbage bags .
starting in july of this year , most taipei residents , who identify themselves as being environmentally conscious , have complied and now separate their garbage . one big family " although taipei city has excellent financial resources and special qualities , please do n't exaggerate these differences , " cautions ou chin - te , the assistant mayor for government services .
" and it 's even more important not to allow political or party differences to create a situation where regions clash or go their own ways . " the element of the taiwan experience that is most worthy of the nation 's pride is the relatively even distribution of wealth and resources . while taipei has national taiwan university and national chengchi university , distant nantou has national chi nan university and chiayi has chung cheng university , both of which also have first - rate faculties and curriculums .
what 's more , " though people in ilan and hualien may earn less money and have fewer facilities and less variety of activities , they also enjoy a lower cost of living , a more relaxed pace of life and clean air , " notes ou . different cities serve different functions . they ca n't be expected to be similar in every respect .
compared to many developing countries , where one city often stands far above the others , taipei 's advantages are really not that remarkable .
tseng shu - cheng notes that the areas close to the train stations in shanghai and guangzhou are thronged with illiterates looking for work and that beggars can be found on virtually any street in jakarta .
these scenes are the result of great poverty in the countryside . farmers have no choice but to come to the cities and struggle at the bottom for the crumbs of the wealthy . even in japan , an advanced industrial nation , tokyo is 4.6 times as large as osaka , the next biggest city .
linking arms the people of taipei are not unaware of their advantages and distance from the " native soil . "
when lung ying - tai took over as head of taipei 's cultural affairs bureau , her first move was to invite other local culture officials to a meeting .
lung says that taipei very much wants to share its resources and experiences with other cities and counties . whether holding an international cultural event or setting the city 's cultural policies , she always asks for the participation or input of other cities and counties .
next year , taipei wants to hold an " asian city cultural summit . " already 21 counties and cities in taiwan have signed on as co-sponsors . the " taipei experience " can be used beneficially .
yet the long - standing differences between taipei and other localities , as well as the differences in ruling parties , get in the way .
seven southern counties and cities have formed a political league centered around kaohsiung . taipei , on the other hand , ca n't even get along with taipei county , which completely surrounds it .
ou chin - te admits that taipei has hardly any high - level ties to other cities and counties .
the city is like a lonely island or a proud and arrogant peacock , fated always to be alone .
this is taipei 's pain , for sure . but is it not also taiwan 's loss ?
what price public art ?
-lrb- tsai wen - ting / tr. by christopher macdonald -rrb- the art market in taiwan has tended to focus on oil painting and ink - and - wash , with relatively little interest in sculpture , photography , ceramics and multimedia .
however , tens of millions of nt dollars have now become available for work in a range of forms , under the provisions of a 1992 law requiring at least one percent of the budget for major infrastructure projects to be spent on public art . as a result , artists from taiwan and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .
in taipei , 1997 was designated as the year of public art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island , chosen by the council for cultural affairs -lrb- cca -rrb- .
1998 also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .
as public art began to proliferate , university departments of art , environment and architecture , spurred by demand , began offering public art courses .
golden opportunity
the development of a number of major infrastructure projects , including the taipei mrt system , the second northern freeway and the new terminal at cks airport , released millions - even hundreds of millions - of nt dollars for spending on public art , creating a golden opportunity for eager artists .
during 1999 , 30 works of public art were completed in line with official provisions , at a cost of nt$ 40 million .
but the budget for yet - to - be - installed works is even more staggering : nt$ 100 million for public art at the new cks airport terminal alone , nt$ 85 million for spending by the kaohsiung port authority , and nt$ 80 million for stations along the wanhua - panchiao branch of taipei 's mrt network .
at a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists . no wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .
the fact that the contest for nine works to be placed along taipei 's " tunhwa art corridor , " organized by taipei 's urban development department , drew entries from over 130 artists , shows how intense the competition can be .
and it is sculptors who have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since three - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the 55 public art works completed in 1998 , 40 were works of sculpture .
art engineering ? at present , public art is chosen through one of four methods : open competition , invitation to tender , commissioning , and direct purchase .
the process has to involve a selection committee from the cca or relevant cultural department at the local level , comprising artists , architects , landscape designers , art educationalists and so on .
the committee appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .
entries which pass the first round are presented for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as to avoid subsequent protests .
unlike those working with other forms of art , the creators of public art need to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .
artistic conception alone is not enough .
they will be submitting expenditure claims and dealing with issues including long - term maintenance and cleaning , and maybe utility supply .
a number of artists have thus found it helpful to pool their talents , setting up workshops geared chiefly to the production of public art .
priceless art ? transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in taiwan . but huang wen - ching , a number of whose works have been successfully selected , points out that artists still have to overcome frequent misunderstandings , such as when the cost of their material
internet pioneer heidi hsueh
when the internet started to take off in taiwan in 1995 , inforian was one of the first taiwan internet startups . in the years since it has made quite a splash in the industry .
back when the internet in taiwan mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with mosaic , a 23 - year - old graduate student at national chengchi university named heidi hsueh and a graduate student at national taiwan university named lawrence ho decided to form an internet company together . they started with just nt$ 500,000 .
hsueh , who speaks with all the self - confidence of a prophet , recalls that she could early on see the tremendous impact that the internet was going to have on people s lives .
" we were riding that first wave , " says hsueh , who points out that deciding to strike at the right time is the first step to success .
starting with books in the early period , inforian - or pasia as it is known today - made money by publishing books and by localizing software for the taiwan market .
hsueh , the co-founder and executive vice president , ca n't count how many times she stayed up all night at the office in those early days .
once , when their distributor for some reason refused to make payments , they had to endure two months without any incoming revenue .
" when you 're considering founding a company , " she says , issuing a warning to the many youths throwing themselves into internet startups , " you 've really got to consider carefully the pressures you 're going to be under . "
the division of labor was clear from the start . ho was responsible for product design , and hsueh handled business development and marketing strategy .
after two years , the company had its first success : the iq97 -lrb- inforian quest -rrb- meta - search engine .
it hit a homerun for their internet dreams . not long after ho finished iq97 , hsueh sent it to the american website zdnet , which awarded it five stars , its highest rating . hsueh then used the internet to find distributors around the world .
soon iq97 had been translated into seven languages and plans were laid to step into the global market .
within a year of the product 's release in october of 1997 , it had sold three million copies worldwide .
inforian followed by launching cicq , a chinese language instant messaging site that attracted 1 million members from around the world . then in 1998 it focused on e-commerce , establishing the online auction site coolbid , which has averaged quarterly sales of nt$ 60 million and has as many as 100,000 members .
hsueh also made plans to forge alliances with world - famous companies .
in 1998 , after seeing hsueh 's strategic alliance plan , intel joined inforian as a strategic partner . later , it decided to take a stake in the company . it was the first time intel had ever invested in an asian internet company .
inforian , or pasia as it is now known , has grown from four employees to a staff of several hundred , and has become a multinational with offices in the united states and on the mainland , as well as in taiwan .
the internet lifestyle
" at pasia we emphasize that the internet is a kind of technological art that allows people to improve their lifestyle , " hsueh says . " this is a work of art that requires creativity to be whole .
the internet is part software , part media , part databank , and part communications device . it 's the best possible space for making the most out of creativity .
" on the front door to the company 's office on hsinyi road , leonardo davinci , albert einstein and the pasia logo grace each other with their respective presences .
hsueh notes that those two historical figures ' hard work and creativity changed the way people live . this is also the spirit that pasia wishes to project . as far as hsueh is concerned , the internet is both a tool and a communications platform .
internet companies , she believes , should reflect that .
as one such company , pasia must be flexible , efficient and practice what it preaches .
the intranet at pasia , for instance , provides chatrooms , vacation request forms , work guidelines , business travel forms , and even a bulletin board for selling workers ' second - hand stuff .
the offices have neon decorations on the walls and a hallway that is no less stylish than a haute couture catwalk . the whole office is infused with a modern and technological sensibility . of course , success is never guaranteed .
american tech stocks took a tumble in april of this year , and people began to talk about an internet bubble . meanwhile , pasia has had trouble obtaining new financing and has seen rapid turnover in its executive ranks , while rumors have circulated about its ipo application being rejected . nevertheless , hsueh holds that pasia has a clear niche and is very adaptable , so that it will be relatively unaffected by the economic downturn .
when you see heidi hsueh 's fresh young face and her no - nonsense approach to doing business , you quickly understand how members of the young generation are realizing their revolutionary ideas about lifestyle and career through the internet .
paralympics offer stage for taiwan performers
closing ceremonies for the 2000 sydney paralympics were held on october 29 . nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated . this event , a manifestation of the ideal that " the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , " broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation . the roc team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any taiwan athlete has returned from an olympic games with a gold .
also , as part of the events , taiwan 's crescent moon dance troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by the australian government to participate in the paralympic arts festival .
but even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the paralympics .
the just - completed paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .
the opening ceremony on october 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .
amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .
the events at the 12 - day paralympics were packed with spectators . the 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously . the host government even set up a huge tv screen in darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to australia , to broadcast the games live .
the games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .
on october 14 , taiwan 's crescent moon dance company created a sensation with their performance " standing on the highest peak , " performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in taiwan .
after the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause . the standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .
the crescent moon dance company has only been in operation for four years . organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , it is the world 's first dance troupe of its kind . as its manifesto reads : " one with no voice may nonetheless sing .
one with no wings may nonetheless soar . one with no limbs may nonetheless dance . the crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . "
the troupe also delighted sydney citizens with a performance at the sydney city hall on october 19 .
in the competition , host country australia took the most medals , including 64 golds . among the roc 's medals , the gold - the first ever for taiwan - was won by chiang chih - chung .
with a throw of 57.28 meters , chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the f12 visually - impaired class .
chiang , a member of the bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero 's welcome home from the bunun of sanmin rural township in kaohsiung county .
during the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised chiang for his glorious deeds .
meanwhile , the roc table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .
in the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , chou chang - sheng and lin yen - hung took the silver , while chou won another silver in the men 's singles .
the men 's class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women 's wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while li ching - chung -lrb- men 's judo class 1 -rrb- and lu li - hua -lrb- women 's powerlifting class 1 -rrb- garnered individual bronzes .
among asian countries , south korea turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .
this was due in part to the fact that the rok government has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service . indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the rok were retired veterans . their pensions allow them free time to train , and through athletics they bring meaning to their lives and glory to their countries .
taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .
they must give up working if they wish to train full - time . the south korean team of veterans , by overcoming their injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed their handicaps into glorious results . this example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .
bands make their mark -lrb- eric lin / tr. by david mayer -rrb- the band tradition in taiwan dates back to the time when the us military forces had bases on the island . it was de rigueur to have a live band at all the bars frequented by american soldiers .
veteran radio program host tao hsiao - ching recalls that when she wanted to organize a concert in the 1960s , there were already a lot of bands to choose from .
apart from bands that worked the bars , there were others that went into the pop music scene .
one example was " the five flower petals , " a five - girl band .
lead singer tsai mi - mi had a very sweet voice -lrb- " mama ! mama ! give me a guitar . . . . " -rrb- , and she was nice looking too .
but the flower petals were n't so much a band as a collection of teen idols . a number of bands appeared in the 1960s that sang mostly western songs . their lead singers sometimes got noticed by music companies and became famous singers .
the most famous ones were huang ying - ying , julie su , kao ling - feng , and billy . campus bands across the island began writing their own music and lyrics in the 1970s . notable examples include the travelers and wood guitar .
these bands , and the folk music they sang , reigned supreme on into the 1980s until the sudden rise of a number of extremely popular rock bands .
some of the more notable 1980s rock bands were the chiu chiu 's , the red ants , and several bands featuring hsueh yueh .
looking back on the origins of band music , tao hsiao - ching attributes its popularity to the albums of lo ta - yu and the fact that many proprietors of pubs and other establishments that hire live music started putting emphasis on " the band sound . " the social commentary in the lyrics of these songs also elicited a strong response .
according to wang tsu - shou , a senior reporter at minsheng daily , " youth bands were so popular , we thought for a while that we had entered into a sort of ' age of the band , ' but it turned out to be short - lived . "
the high tide of band music spurred the formation of many student bands , and khs musical company used to organize an annual campus rock band competition where many singers and bands got their first big break , including chang yu - sheng , tai cheng - hsiao , and the orient express .
the latter , which was composed entirely of good - looking guys , was the only group that released an album together after going professional , however , while chang and tai opted to strike out on their own as solo artists .
as tao hsiao - ching explains , band music only appealed to a limited market , and it was very expensive to keep a band operating .
for these reasons , music companies preferred to sign up only the lead singers . this remained the prevailing pattern in the industry from kao ling - feng 's time through the appearance of chang yu - sheng . then china , harlem yu & ding jian pai dang , baboo , and wu bai and his band all released albums in 1992 . the music world was electrified , and people began talking once again about the arrival of " the age of the band , " but the market for this music was still weak .
the only one of these albums that became a big hit was harlem yu & ding jian pai dang , and this album 's strong sales were due in large part to the fame of the singer , harlem yu .
wu bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s . then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called china blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet . the success of wu bai & china blue has rested primarily , however , on wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .
amidst this rebirth of youth bands in the 1990s , there has been a very interesting undercurrent . groupie , ltk commune , and a raft of other underground bands have quietly been carving out a niche for themselves in the pub scene .
both mainstream and non-mainstream music companies -lrb- such as friendly dog and crystal records , respectively -rrb- have begun to release their albums , thus giving a small number of enthusiasts ample opportunity to keep up to date with the unde
it 's the " knowledge - based " economy , stupid !
-lrb- laura li / photos by jimmy lin / tr. by phil newell -rrb- a saying has it that " knowledge is power . "
but here at the turn of the century , people are discovering that knowledge is more than just power ; it is also profit .
responding to the new realities , the executive yuan has put forward a plan to develop taiwan 's " knowledge - based economy " which aims to double per capita income within ten years . this plan embraces the long-term economic goals of the new administration .
but what is covered under the rubric of developing the knowledge - based economy ?
what conditions are required to be successful ?
does taiwan meet these criteria ?
did you know that 90 % of the knowledge in the world has been produced in the half century since the end of world war ii ? and in 20 years , what we know today will be only one percent of the total knowledge bank of our children !
" it is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century . now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes wu se-hwa , dean of the business school at national chengchi university . the explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .
profit defines value
in 1992 , shortly after us president bill clinton took office , he declared that emphasis should be placed on research and development and on creating a " new economy . " it turns out that these last eight years in the us have been a golden age of high economic growth , falling unemployment , and stable prices .
in 1996 , the oecd coined the term " knowledge - based economy , " and many governments have jumped on the bandwagon since .
you can call it the " new economy " or the " knowledge - based economy " or whatever , but what is it really ? how can such an economy be created ?
because each country has different development needs , there are many different answers to these questions .
wu se-hwa points out that the term " knowledge - based economy " refers to any economic activity based on the production or application of knowledge , in which " knowledge " includes all kinds of technology , patents , management know-how , and individual creations .
it is not important how profound or esoteric the knowledge may be ; what matters most is turning that knowledge into a product which can earn a profit .
looking back at the economic history of the west , in 16th century society , agricultural products were the key to wealth and power . whoever had the most , and most fertile , land was in a dominant position .
in the industrial age , capitalists who commanded the wealth to buy machinery and hire workers , or who owned critical resources like coal and oil , replaced landowners as the dominant figures in the economy .
but today , whoever owns systematized knowledge will win out over his or her competitors .
when lester thurow , the well - known economist from the massachusetts institute of technology , came to taiwan to give a lecture a half year ago , he pointed to the microsoft corporation as a prime example : microsoft owns no farmland , no oil fields , no expensive and sophisticated factories , and no shops of its own . its product fits onto a tiny microchip .
yet this company , relying only on the brainpower of several thousand engineers sitting in front of computers writing programs , has earned billions upon billions of dollars for owner bill gates .
it is estimated that 300 million persons use microsoft windows each day around the world , with annual revenues reaching us$ 25 billion .
knowledge petrie dish
in the past , chinese people discovered much knowledge and invented much technology , but , influenced by the confucian belief that profit was not a worthy application of wisdom , never converted these into commercial products . but in the face of today 's dramatic global economic transformation , there is no choice but to try to turn knowledge into profit . and the thing that links knowledge with profit is information technology -lrb- it -rrb- .
hsu wen-hsing , founder of smartek engineering , whose company has twice won national awards in taiwan for its fingerprint verification device , says that human history can be seen as the history of information .
when marco polo visited the east in the 13th century , if he had not left a written account of his travels , it would have been a virtually wasted trip .
the recent enthusiasm for the taipei exhibition of terracotta warriors from xi'an is due to the fact that these long - buried figures contain information about mysteries dating back 2000 years . hsu wen-hsing points out that in the past information was always tied to material objects , and remained in the hands of the few .
when the material objects disappeared , so did the information they contained .
but now , thanks to it , for the first time in history information can be forever stored in huge volume , ready and waiting to be manipulated , exchanged , and even sent across great distances . it is like a petrie dish .
information cells swim around in it , and can divide , recombine , reproduce , and copy themselves without limit , opening up entirely new possibilities for the accumulation and application of knowledge .
for example , computers are capable of finding numbers hidden under or scattered throughout a huge pile of data which is impenetrable to the human brain , and can analyze and clarify these numbers into useful know-how .
" one order form is not information . but , by using a computer to save , connect , and search individual order forms , one can draw a thread through tens of thousands of them , and discern their regularities and variations . now that 's knowledge , " declares simon chang , president of acer cybercenter services . at a glance you can find information such as regional and seasonal variations in sales , or market acceptance of a given product .
and if there is a problem , it can be identified immediately , avoiding guesswork and wasted time .
everyone a multibillionaire !
in the information world , everyone is equal . though huge multinational corporations may have an edge in terms of information technology , since the rapid growth of the internet in the 1990s , ' little guys ' whom no one has ever heard of before - relying only on programming ability , creativity , and hard work - have had the space to bring their talents into play .
the best - known example is yahoo , the world 's number one web portal . it all started with two stanford phd students looking for a way to categorize the websites online , who came up with a great idea for a way to make finding information easier for internet users .
with this idea , after six years of hard work , today yahoo has a market value of us$ 50 billion . over the past five years profits have grown at a rate of 9800 % , which has got to be some kind of record .
however , though knowledge may be profitable , its value is subject to severe fluctuation .
george tsao , assistant vice president of the knowledge management center at winbond electronics corporation , notes that in the past you could determine the worth of a company by adding up its fixed assets -lrb- such as land and factories -rrb- and liquid assets -lrb- such as cash -rrb- , with each calculable down to the last penny .
but knowledge is intangible . two different software packages burned onto identical chips can have grossly different values . sometimes it all depends on luck or fads .
the dramatic rise and fall of us software stocks this past year reflects the difficulty of assessing the value of knowledge .
wu se-hwa points to intel as a prime example of how knowledge can " convert silicon to gold . " a name - card sized cpu is in fact just a chipboard with complicated circuitry , with a unit cost of less than us$ 35 .
but because it includes unique information that makes the computer run , and carries the authority of " intel inside , " it can fetch over us$ 1000 in the marketplace , many times the cost of production .
what about taiwan ?
clearly there is already a global trend in which an information economy is taking shape . what advantages does taiwan have for playing a larger role in this realm ?
simon chang , who left the job of director of planning at the national science council only six months ago to enter the private sector , points out that the knowledge - based economy basically deals in information technology , and the it industry is the most profitable region in the emerging geography of the knowledge - based economy .
taiwan currently ranks fourth in the world in value of it production , and , if you include the plants established by taiwan investors across the globe , taiwanese - controlled firms lead the world in manufacturing of it hardware .
in other words , taiwan has a solid manufacturing base and a large pool of high quality human resources on which it can rely to develop the knowledge - based economy .
also , taiwan has a strong education system . the results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in natural sciences and math show that taiwan kids finished first in the former and third -lrb- behind only singapore and korea -rrb- in the latter .
alice chang , ceo of cyberlink corporation , whose firm has become a much - coveted new entry in the stock market and has drawn international attention with audio-visual software like power dvd and talking show , says : " talented people are at the root of knowledge . "
av software is very difficult to produce , and staff must have a solid grounding in math .
this is where taiwan is at an advantage . however , though taiwan has its strong points , there are also a number of problems and shortcomings .
" the first thing to consider , says wu se-hwa , " is this : what kind of knowledge - based economy is taiwan most suited to ? "
wu says that right now what the government is focusing on and what stock market players most hope for is a us - style " new economy . " the focus is on new industries , such as software and the internet , or communications technology , fiber - optics , biotechnology , and the like . but can the american model be reproduced in taiwan ?
there is little reason to be optimistic .
the new economy in the us depends heavily , for one thing , on a deep foundation of basic scientific research , which comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods .
another key factor is that the us has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship , so that new ideas have a chance to be brought into play . the rapid growth in the new economy has driven a decade - long economic boom in the states . the old manufacturing economy has naturally been trimmed back , with factories relocating overseas , but american firms can depend on the rights to technology to earn a profit .
pearl tan , public relations manager at applied materials taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant us semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : dram , the hottest industry in taiwan , which was a monopoly of the us firm texas instruments . tan notes that although dram factories are closing one after another in the us , patent royalties must still be paid to texas instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million drams produced around the world annually . this is a classic " knowledge goose that lays golden eggs . "
the new economy is a weapon by which the us dominates the world , with " the export of knowledge " replacing the export of goods .
yet , in the entire world , only the us , japan , and the uk export more technology than they import .
in other words , only these three countries have a surplus in " knowledge trade , " and can make money by selling knowledge .
of these three , us income from selling technology is four times the amount it spends buying technology elsewhere , and it earns enough each year in patent royalties to balance its enormous deficit in manufactured goods .
in contrast , taiwan is still showing a nasty deficit in knowledge trade , with money going out twice as fast as it is coming in .
the impressive american model would certainly be difficult to apply to the small " shallow " economy in taiwan . as ko chen-en , dean of the college of management at national taiwan university , puts it : " you merely have to ask how many nobel prize winners taiwan has - not many - and you know its real ability to follow the us economic model . " ko relates that " high-risk and high-profit " revolutionary new technologies can normally only be created with enormous financial backing . in 1999 , total expenditures on r&d in taiwan by both the government and private sector were a mere nt$ 200 billion -lrb- about us $ 6 billion -rrb- , less than was spent by ibm alone . slow improvement
in contrast to the " picking stars from the sky " us model , says wu se-hwa , " the european knowledge - based economy concept is closer to what taiwan needs . "
as wu explains , the oecd definition of the knowledge - based economy embraces all kinds of industries , from italian shoes to dutch flowers . any industry that increases its knowledge component , using knowledge to improve management , innovate , or improve quality , can be considered a knowledge industry .
this is a much more practical ambition for taiwan , which has a high proportion of traditional industry and is extremely dependent on oem manufacturing to make money .
in 1998 taiwan had more than 4500 patents approved in the us , ranking fourth .
but not many of these were for original discoveries ; most were in the category of improvements of old ideas , mainly ways to increase efficiency in the manufacturing process .
innovations that are improvements require less money for r&d , and do not require genius-like creativity , but can be made primarily by devoting more attention to a specific problem .
s.t. day , chairman of the national association of small and medium enterprises of the roc , and chairman of the san sun hat and cap company , takes the following case in point : on most caps there is an " eyelet " in the stitching . but , because of different machine designs , the gap can be 80 , 90 , or 100 stitches , creating problems for quality control .
san sun created a computer program that ensures that machines leave a uniform gap of 95 stitches , and even gets the machines to tie a lovely knot when the sticthcing is completed . this seemingly small improvement actually allows the firm to charge double the unit price per hat .
day has factories in taiwan , the us , mainland china , and dominica .
wages in taiwan are 15 times greater than in the prc , and 100 times greater than in burma . " if taiwan workers just make hats and do nothing else , then it does n't pay . but if , because of their higher quality , these workers come up with their own ideas for improving the production process , then they are worth it , " says day with the voice of experience . he says that in assessing the value of employees , you have to look at more than just the value of the product ; you have to also take into account its " intelligence " value .
san sun insists it will not lay off any taiwan workers , nor will it hire foreign laborers in taiwan , and its sales have not suffered as a result . indeed , orders through october of 2000 showed an increase of 60 % over the previous year .
via con dios via technologies , a stock market powerhouse in taiwan which has made a tremendous impact in the chipset market these past two years , and which is even threatening the dominant position of intel , has adopted a different strategy for gradually expanding its territory .
william lee , who works in public relations at via , says that the production of chipsets is a high risk activity .
so , taking advantage of the boom in the taiwan stock market over the past two years , the company went on a binge of hiring , acquisitions , and strategic alliances , expanding in size rapidly .
lee says that in the past , via 's chipsets were designed completely to support intel specification cpus .
in 1998 , when intel insisted on sticking with expensive rambus memory chips despite a poor market response , via saw its opportunity : it began promoting use of the p133 memory chip , which had been created by an international consortium and was provided to factories free of charge . for the first time , via had challenged the " big boss , " intel .
in the latter half of 1999 , via acquired two cpu companies in the states , giving it an independent ability to develop cpus . in addition , half a year ago it entered into cooperation with the us graphics powerhouse s3 to make graphics chips . in these ways , via is moving step by step to enlarge its intellectual holdings .
" you have to have a lot of technology already on hand before you can start talking about systematic integration and trying out major innovations , " says lee . it is only now that via can escape from the specifications dictated by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of its own .
to meet future market demand for home appliances that are inexpensive , multi-functional , and portable , the main direction will be to get all the functions on to a single chip . via has designed a new 3 - in - 1 chipset which includes cpu , memory , and graphics , which are expected to formally hit the market in the first half of 2001 . as lee reveals : " no one has ever done this before . we are trying something new . "
save the idiots !
nonetheless , knowledge and creativity are intangible , and it is not always easy to determine ownership .
this is especially problematic in taiwan , where some people still do n't have a very clear idea about intellectual property rights , and legal protections are less than comprehensive . this is a potential problem for the development of the knowledge - based economy in taiwan . " many innovations just represent going a little bit further in thinking about a problem than the other guys , and once the secret is uncovered , it is easy for them to copy the idea , " says simon chang . the most famous example in the industry involves a certain company that wanted to create information systems like storage and document handling . it invited a number of information industry firms to give briefings on their products .
after a while , this former " outsider " became an insider , and created its own product , congratulating itself on saving so much money in the process . simon chang notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .
if small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .
this is precisely the problem now being faced by comdek , the first company in taiwan to produce medical instruments such as blood - oxygen monitors and ear thermometers . michael y.s. kuo , general manager at comdek , points out that the quick and easy process of taking body temperature through the ear was developed by an american company , and the german giant boehringer-ingelheim paid a huge amount of money for the patent so they could begin production .
comdek took the basic principle , and went to work on it , eventually coming up with their own version , for which they have been awarded a patent .
but when comdek 's product came out , michael kuo still found himself in a vicious struggle with taiwan pirate firms : " it 's equivalent to making fools out of those of us who invest the money to do research and development ! "
kuo says that while there has been some improvement in taiwan with regard to protection of intellectual property rights , there is still not enough for those who invest in development and innovation .
comdek has closed its laboratory and production line to any outside visits , and has not ruled out the possibility of moving its lab overseas to get away from industrial espionage in taiwan .
looking for a taiwan mcdonald 's espionage reflects a lack of respect for knowledge .
but there is also the problem of insufficient awareness of the potential value of knowledge , so that , as wu se-hwa says , taiwan firms " are sitting on a mountain of gold , but do n't know that they can sell what they know for hard cash . "
" the most ' classic ' form of knowledge product is one in which the intangible value of the knowledge transcends the tangible value of the product , and can be reproduced in large volume at low cost , thus earning huge profits . " wu points to the us coffee shop chain starbucks . can they really make huge profits just by selling cups of coffee for a couple of bucks ?
of course not . the headquarters company in fact spends most of its time handling the sale of franchise rights worldwide . what starbucks sells is not coffee , but " the knowledge of how to run a coffee shop . " the same logic applies to mcdonalds : who does n't know how to draw their " golden arches " trademark ? it does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast - food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5 % of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .
in recent years , as taiwan firms have increasingly invested abroad , the " taiwan experience " has penetrated deeply into southeast asia and mainland china . in both the manufacturing and service sectors , taiwan businessmen have proven adept at flexibly adapting to local society . but now that taiwan methods are well understood and widely copied , taiwan investors are being dropped by their local partners .
" taiwan companies do n't understand how to ensure their earnings from management knowledge and company name recognition , and are not in the habit of selling rights or earning royalties , " says wu with regret , as he offers the following examples : taiwan department stores are a cut above prc state - run stores , taiwan 's construction industry has the knack for systematic management , and even industries like eel - raising have their own technologies and operating methods , but people only think about keeping these secrets to themselves and making money by working on their own .
they do n't know how to spread knowledge so that others will make money for them !
of course , to sell operational know-how , this knowledge must be converted into steps , systems , and standards , and must be well - packaged . and trademarks and patents must be employed to deter potential pirates .
wu suggests that organizations in taiwan which are dedicated to teaching management methods , such as the china productivity center , should assist companies in systematizing and selling the rights to their mangement and operating philosophies , so that the uniquely flexible taiwan approach to business can be reproduced and marketed worldwide .
" if only people would change their attitudes , the knowledge - based economy could have many new components , and every industry , firm , or individual could find an opportunity to make money on this new frontier , " concludes wu .
looking to the future , the road to a knowledge - based economy is long , but it is the only choice for taiwan .
what is most important now is to remove obstacles from the path , and to make each stride as large and quick as possible . p. 006
bringing brain power together with computer power is what developing the knowledge - based economy is all about .

superstore consumer culture
-lrb- teng sue - feng / photos by jimmy lin / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb- yet another superstore chain has come to taiwan .
on december 9 , the british firm tesco said hello to consumers in taiwan when it formally opened its clean , bright and spacious store . there are now about 100 retailers in taiwan with individual stores of at least several thousand ping -lrb- a ping equals 36 square feet -rrb- .
with the full adoption of two - day weekends every other week , people in taiwan have had to figure out what to do with these new days off .
visiting superstores - with their ample parking , restaurants and piles of consumer goods - has become a major leisure - time activity .
what kind of social changes does taiwan 's consumer behavior reflect ?
is densely populated taiwan well suited to absorb all these stores , which are sprouting up like mushrooms after a rain ?
waves of traffic are heading out from taipei toward the suburbs , toward the open expanses in the riverbed area of neihu .
once the cars pass the minchuan or the second macarthur bridge , the landscape becomes dotted with the large signs of major retailers .
these include costco , the third largest superstore retailer in the united states ; b&q , the largest do - it - yourself hardware chain in britain ; and taiwan 's own rt - mart .
shopping at these large stores has quickly become a part of leisure - time life in taiwan .
a mrs. chao , who lives in neihu , explains that on weekends or vacation days the whole family sleeps late .
once they are up , if there 's nothing special on the agenda , they go to b&q to look at stuff for the home .
then when they get tired , they go to costco for some pizza or muffins .
finally , they end up in rt - mart , where they buy groceries .
the whole trip takes about half the day .
she had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in november she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the rt - mart 's deli department .
she discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure .
she was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .
" shopping at one of these superstores is a lot like shopping at a department store , " says a mr. ko , who works as an engineer for a chemical company in kaohsiung .
" you go when you 're bored . "
ko has discovered that as more and more of these stores have opened in kaohsiung , he and his wife go to department stores less , because in department stores you can only buy clothes , but in superstores you can buy daily necessities , hardware and so forth , and the selection is better .
shocking the world
the performance of these large retailers in taiwan has been startling , and superstore chains from holland , france , the united states and britain have been arriving on these shores one after another .
a hundred - some foreign stores do nt$ 110 billion in business a year .
according to the ministry of finance 's office of statistics , business in the first quarter of 2000 for these stores was up 19.54 % over the same quarter the previous year , a higher rate of growth than for convenience stores , supermarkets or department stores .
since the dutch firm makro opened its first taiwan store in taoyuan in 1989 , superstores have enjoyed tremendous growth .
the french retailer carrefour followed makro 's lead , opening a store in 1989 .
costco from the united states began planning its first taiwan store in 1995 , and the french wholesale outlet casino arrived in 1999 .
a year earlier , the ruentex group , which owns rt - mart , bought out two taiwanese competitors and increased its number of stores to 16 .
that same year , 1998 , tesco from britain began to look for sites .
after nearly three years of preparation , in december 2000 they finally opened their first taiwan store in taoyuan .
no one had expected that european superstores would be the first to establish a foothold in taiwan , which had long taken its cues from the american market .
allen tien , the head of carrefour 's public affairs division in taiwan , relates that wal
little three links presage new era in cross-strait relations -lrb- sharon wu / tr. by phil newell -rrb- the " little three links " - direct mail , transport , and commerce between the roc islands of kinmen and matsu on the one side and the prc on the other - were formally opened on january 2 . -lrb- they were originally supposed to start on january 1 , but were postponed to the 2nd at the request of the prc . -rrb-
this step is seen as setting the stage for the eventual opening of the full " three links " - direct mail , commerce , and transport between taiwan proper and the prc - and for taiwan 's entry into the world trade organization . but the prc has remained as chilly as ever , and it is uncertain what breakthroughs and benefits can be realized through the little three links .
it is expected that both taiwan and the prc will enter the wto this year . looking ahead , with the alteration of the previous administration 's " no haste " policy , cross-strait trade relations will enter a new era .
on december 20 , premier chang chun - hsiung declared that the opening of the little three links on january 1 was a major part of the government 's mainland policy , and also the prelude to the full three links that will be implemented after wto entry .
tsai ing - wen , chairwoman of the mainland affairs commission -lrb- mac -rrb- , says that the focus in the first stage of the little three links will be on the issues of public security and the local economy in kinmen and matsu .
the first step will be decriminalization and legalization of petty trade . only after observing the impact of the first stage on social order and local industries in kinmen and matsu will the second stage - opening of normal commercial activities - be considered . as for the opening of the full three links , there is no particular timetable . on december 18 , mac vice-chairman teng chen - chung stated that the government has already begun planning for the full three links .
faced with questions raised by some legislators that the government is focusing on the little three links as a tactic to postpone the full three links , teng declared that the full three links will definitely be implemented , but the first priority is to coordinate these with taiwan 's wto entry , with secondary attention going to taiwan 's own needs .
most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . in an article published on december 25 , the united daily news declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the taiwan strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . in addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .
as the borderless global economy takes shape in the 21st century , the three links will help businesses expand their economic space and encourage industrial upgrading , with both sides benefiting .
but prc economic experts note that , once both sides enter the wto , the mainland 's large market will be contested by firms from all over the world . they say that the transfer of high technology firms from taiwan to the prc will aid in construction of a " chinese economic grouping " which would raise the decision - making status of the two sides in international economic affairs .
on another front , in terms of tourism , in june of 2001 taiwan expects to implement a new policy allowing mainland tourists to come to taiwan . this could be very significant in increasing exchanges and mutual understanding between the two sides . most opinion leaders in the prc view this policy positively .
beijing 's china travel association says that mainland people can now travel for tourism to 15 regions or countries , and it is a shame that taiwan - which is close geographically and shares a common language and heritage - has never been open for mainland travelers . a recent opinion poll in the prc shows that 25 million people there say that they would rather visit taiwan than any other tourist destination .
mt. ali -lrb- alishan -rrb- and sun moon lake are the places in taiwan they would most like to visit , and they also are looking forward to eating authentic taiwan cuisine and drinking genuine " pearl milk tea . "
unfortunately , not only have the mainland authorities not responded enthusiastically to the little three links , they have even attacked the policy .
on december 28 , zhou mingtong , vice-director of the state council 's taiwan affairs office , stated at a banquet for taiwan media that the little three links are " small potatoes . "
li yafei , secretary - general of the prc 's association for relations across the strait , said that the mainland does n't even have the concept or term " little three links , " and that the key to the " three links " remains the " one china " principle .
looking to future cross-strait interactions , the opening of the three links -lrb- at least for tourism and economic interactions -rrb- does not have to get bogged down in the debate over independence vs. reunification , and has in fact already become a new consensus between the two sides .
the success of the relevant government policies in conforming to public opinion and building healthy cross-strait relations , and the prc 's willingness to tone down the rhetoric and make peace the top priority , will be decisive in creating a win - win situation and in reinvigorating the economy .

activities mark international human rights day -lrb- sharon wu / tr. by phil newell -rrb- protecting human rights is one of the key policies of the new government . among the activities conducted in this vein , on december 10 , 2000 - international human rights day - the office of the president and the national cultural association co-sponsored a unique " human rights wedding ceremony . "
in addition , president chen shui - bian initiated a series of activities under the theme of human rights week to remind taiwan citizens of the importance of human rights . in commemoration of international human rights day on december 10 , the nationsl human rights consultative task force of the office of the president organized a series of activities to draw attention to this issue . first up was a conference at national taiwan university on the subject of reviewing the cases of persons persecuted as " communist spies . "
a lively discussion of the cases of sun li - jen and kuo ting - liang took place . on december 9 , a ceremony was held on green island , site of a former political prison , to commemorate the first anniversary of the construction of the human rights memorial there .
on december 10 came the " human rights wedding ceremony " at the taipei guest house , and that same night an event to express " thanksgiving and respect " was held at the taipei international convention center .
the green island human rights memorial , completed a year ago , takes as its focus the determination that the terrible events of the past should never be repeated . it reminds the people of taiwan of the long period of " white terror " under which the island suffered , and hopes to raise humanitarian awareness .
pesus chou , executive secretary of the human rights education foundation , says that this year a further list of 180 victims was accepted , and there are now a total of 690 names of victims of political persecution engraved on the wall .
a number of victims and their family members also attended the ceremony , at which they presented a petition on behalf of more than 10,000 victims of political terror whose names can not be inscribed on the wall because of lack of official documentation of their cases .
they called for justice for these victims as well . president chen shui - bian personally attended the anniversary event , and vowed to carry on the policy , initiated by the previous government , of apologizing to and caring for the victims . he emphasized that his administration would abide by the international declaration of human rights , the citizens ' public trust treaty , and the manifesto and action platform of the vienna international convention on human rights , so that taiwan could be a part of the international human rights system .
he again called on the legislative yuan to codify international human rights law as domestic law , and declared that his government will also establish a national human rights commission and work to build a society in which human rights are respected and protected .
on the morning of human rights day , the national culture association and the well - known author bo yang -lrb- one of the prime movers behind the human rights memorial -rrb- held a " human rights marriage ceremony . "
the event , conducted in beautiful weather at the taipei guest house , was attended by a number of couples from around taiwan who chose this day to formalize their ties .
president chen served as master of ceremonies . during the ceremony , president chen read out the eight vows drafted by bo yang for his " human rights marriage certificate , " extolling mutual respect for domestic human rights as the foundation of social stability .
besides having president chen serve as master of ceremonies , bo yang and vice president annette lu served as honored guests , while control yuan president frederick chien and minister of the interior chang po - ya also had prominent roles . among those in attendance were senior advisor to the president yu chen yue - ying , minister of education ovid tzeng , and council for aboriginal affairs chairman yohani iskakavut .
representatives of various sectors of society , including dentists , lawyers , military personnel , civil servants , indigenous people , and the handicapped , were among the couples taking part in the ceremony , which was meant to be inclusive of and meaningful for all citizens .
with more than 100 guests and family members also joining in , there was fun to be had by one and all .
president chen toasted the new couples and expressed his hope that they would soon give birth to " human rights babies " and act as pioneers in building a human rights society , creating models for the passing along of human rights education in the family .
p. 066
in the first " human rights wedding ceremony , " 36 couples took vows to respect each other 's human rights , creating the first " human rights families . "

at the end of december there was an - other piece of good news concerning the new government 's crackdown on crime . fugitive huang wen - chung , wanted for complicity in the slaying of former kaohsiung county council speaker wu ho - sung , was arrested in phuket after a two - year investigation and with the cooperation of the thai police authorities . and a month earlier the executive yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the election and recall law that is designed to block mob - affiliated individuals from running for public office .
it is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of taiwanese politics . cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .
on december 15 the ministry of justice released the results of the first six months of its campaign against black gold -lrb- i.e. collusion among politicians , crime syndicates and big business -rrb- .
in the period up to december 10 , prosecutors around taiwan dealt with more than 2,000 cases concerning black - gold offenses , brought charges against 30 elected officials and representatives , and found over nt$ 2.59 billion in misappropriated public funds .
the following cases , currently under investigation , have attracted particular attention : the alleged involvement of linkou mayor tsai tzung - yi , yingko township chief hsu yuan - ho and linkou council deputy chairman chou yeh - feng in the operation of an illegal waste dump at a disused brickyard ; alleged fraud by nantou county commissioner peng pai - hsien in connection with construction projects ; allegations of corruption against hsinchu mayor tsai jen - chien ; and the suspected embezzlement of post-921 earthquake relief funds by hsinchu municipal council speaker cheng cheng - kuang .
cases in which charges have already been brought include : the alleged misuse of public funds for overseas trips by miaoli county commissioner fu hsueh - peng , along with county councilors lo hsing - chun and hsieh ching - chuan ; alleged breaches of the securities transaction law by leading brokerage owner you hwai - yin ; alleged financial fraud by national legislator lin jui - tu ; and alleged corruption by tainan mayor george chang in connection with a canal dredging project .
on december 6 the executive yuan passed a draft amendment to the public officials election and recall law , tightening the criteria for those seeking public office so as to prevent mob affiliates from securing legal immunity as elected representatives .
under the new provisions , anyone convicted and sentenced to jail under the organized crime statute is barred for life from seeking election to an official post , while those indicted for a capital offence or for crimes carrying sentences of ten years or more are barred pending the verdict of the court .
political parties become liable for the records of their candidates and face fines of nt$ 500,000 to nt$ 5 million if they nominate candidates who have prior convictions for electoral fraud or election violence .
these revisions to the law will immediately affect a number of parliamentary incumbents , including legislators kuo ting - tsai and wu tze - yuan , both of whom face disqualification from re-election .
the new provisions have received cross-party support in the legislature , though some deputies want further consultation concerning the exclusion from elections of those charged with but not yet convicted of the relevant offences , as this may deprive them unfairly of their rights .
ho chih - hui , secretary - general of the kmt caucus in the legislature , says that the party supports barring those convicted of involvement in organized crime from public office , but feels that the executive yuan needs to clarify just what " involvement " constitutes in this context .
also , at the end of december and after much consultation within the opposition alliance , a preliminary agreement was reached on the draft amendment to the farmers ' and fishermen 's associations law , which has been under lengthy review in the legislature .
according to the agreement , restrictions on those seeking association membership and sub-committee posts will be relaxed , but the rules will be tightened for those running for the posts of director or general secretary , excluding or removing from office anyone who is in default for more than a year on loans from these and other such financial organizations .
however , the amendment remains stuck in the legislative queue for the time being .
in addition to the ministry of justice , the criminal investigation bureau has also scored some successes in the past few months in its campaign against crime syndicates .
in early november the leader of the four seas gang , yang kuang - nan , who had been arrested in shanghai by mainland authorities , was transferred to taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at macau airport and brought back to taiwan for questioning .
yang had fled to the mainland in november 1997 , after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a loan - shark operation , and has been a key target for the police ever since .
good news has also been coming in from local prosecutors ' offices around taiwan . prosecutors in taitung have been investigating county councilors for alleged corruption involving public grants and construction projects , and after half a year of the investigation 19 representatives have been indicted , including the current speaker and deputy speaker of the county council , along with 41 members of the previous two sessions of the council . this sets a judicial record for the number of elected representatives facing charges in a single case .
meanwhile , prosecutors in changhua have been investigating electoral fraud from the time of the presidential election , and are seeking sentences of two months to three years for over 200 people , including the head of yuanlin township , for breaking the election and recall law .
the ministry of justice has achieved a measure of success so far in its crackdown on black gold , but in order to win public support it has had to stress to investigators the need to observe due process and respect suspects ' rights .
the ministry has also required prosecutors to use discretion when collecting evidence about suspected financial impropriety by officials - for which there is a low rate of conviction - so as not to obstruct the work of civil servants or damage their morale .
terracotta warriors invade taipei
-lrb- tsai wen - ting / tr. by david mayer -rrb-
the terracotta warriors from the tomb of qin shi huang , which is included on the list of world heritage sites of the unesco , have come ashore in taiwan ! the 17 warriors now on display at the national museum of history represent the largest contingent from the ancient tomb ever to travel on loan outside of mainland china .
" reporting to the general , sir ! a mob of thousands has surrounded the building ! "
a mounted warrior delivers the dire news to his commander , whose high rank can be seen in his tasseled helmet and coat of mail .
the " mob , " of course , is thirsty not for blood . they just want a glimpse of the warriors . although the warriors may not be aware of it , they are the star attraction at a blockbuster exhibit showing now at the national museum of history in taipei . since opening on december 15 , the exhibit has touched off a wave of enthusiasm in taiwan for the terracotta warriors , and lines for admission have often snaked along the street for hundreds of meters .
over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of january . many schools in central and southern taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .
eighth wonder
shaanxi province was hit by a long drought in the summer of 1974 .
the farmer yang zhifa and a neighbor were digging a well when a shovel clinked on something hard . yang exclaimed , " whoa ! it 's them ! " locals had talked for generations about the buried clay figures that they would sometimes run across while digging in the fields . everyone knew they were out there , but no one knew quite what they were .
people figured they must have been connected with ancestral spirits of some sort .
anxious not to run afoul of the netherworld , the farmers would always hurriedly throw dirt back over the spot and find a better place to dig .
this time , however , yang zhifa went a step further . he reported the incident to his superiors at the local commune .
it was n't long before archeologists were swarming over the site , unearthing an army of terracotta warriors that had lain buried for over 2,000 years .
the stunning discovery was dubbed the eighth wonder of the world . the terracotta army gives a graphic illustration of the grand scale of qin shi huang 's ambitions .
it also shows how technologically advanced china already was when qin shi huang was buried some 2,200 years ago .
in order to create the feel of an actual descent into the emperor 's tomb , the museum has arranged the exhibit so that visitors enter on the second floor and descend from there into a tomb - like atmosphere on the first floor , where the dimly lit space affords a glimpse of what was on the emperor 's mind during the years he was busily uniting china for the very first time in history .
the afterlife
qin shi huang united china in the year 221 b.c .
he regarded his achievements as " surpassing those of the three kings and five emperors of old , " and appointed himself " the first true emperor , " or qin shi huang .
a believer in the possibility of immortality , the emperor once dispatched a trusted aide on a voyage across the seas to search for magic herbs that would provide eternal youth .
perhaps as " plan b , " he also poured vast resources into the construction of a burial mound equipped with all the accoutrements that he was accustomed to in the here and now .
the population of the kingdom of qin at that time was about 20 million , of whom over 2 million were mobilized to bring his grand underground palace to completion .
now that the complex has been discovered , it is unquestionably the life - size terracotta warriors and horses that inspire the most amazement . the 8,000 figures that have been unearthed at the site in shaanxi province were all executed with painstaking realism .
the rank of each figure determined every little detail of its making , right down to the type of military uniform , cap , armor , hairstyle , and beard .
artisans even incised the soles of the soldiers ' shoes to show the threads , and made sure the horses ' teeth were realistically done .
each face is unique . some characters project an air of stern authority . others suggest a fierce and violent personality . still other faces clearly belong to tender , untested young greenhorns . the tremendous individuality in the warriors never fails to amaze . indeed , there are people who subscribe to the rumor that each clay figure encloses the corpse of a real person .
careful inspection of the markings on the figures reveals that about 90 " master craftsmen " participated in the making of the terracotta warriors , each supported by a team of ten or more assistants . the total number of artisans involved probably came to nearly a thousand . some of them were employed by imperial kilns , while others came from private establishments .
it was a huge undertaking , for each figure had to be shaped , molded , kneaded , sculpted , and painted . decorative relief elements had to be applied . the figures had to be covered with an off - white slip to approximate the color of skin . the hair , too , had to be appropriately colored .
even the horses were painted in appropriate shades of reddish - brown and black . their tongues were done in pink , and their teeth in white . the soldiers stand a surprising 180 centimeters in height , prompting many to ask whether the men of that time were actually taller than their modern counterparts .
there are two different theories concerning this question , says wu yongqi , the head of the museum of terracotta warriors . in taipei for the exhibit , wu explains that some say it is natural that the figures should be taller since people from china 's northwest - where the qin kingdom was located - have always been taller than other chinese .
others , however , theorize that the artisans intentionally made the figures slightly larger than life to compensate for the shrinkage that would take place while the freshly molded figures were drying .
the cultured side of qin
but if you visit the exhibit , do n't be so dazzled by the terracotta figures that you forget all about the exhibit 's larger focus on qin artifacts in general .
tu cheng - sheng , director of the national palace museum , stated after visiting the exhibit that most of our knowledge concerning the qin dynasty comes from official dynastic histories authored during the han period .
these later authors generally had a jaundiced view of the qin , and tended to focus on the ruthless , autocratic rule of qin shi huang while paying less attention to the positive achievements of qin culture , or the beauty of qin handicrafts .
a round eaves - tile at the exhibit features an image of a running deer , its stout , robust frame executed with startling skill . an elderly visitor was overheard exclaiming to his wife : " they made such beautiful tiles ! i wonder if we can even do anything that nice today ? "
also featured at the exhibit are two replicas of brass qin - period chariots on loan from the taiwanese art collector huang jen - chung and the national museum of natural science . each chariot is assembled from over 7,000 different pieces , and is half the size of the original , which has been described as " the most extraordinary bronze piece ever made " on account of its huge size , complex structure , and lifelike realism .
in addition , scholars have discovered that the bronze weapons unearthed along with the soldiers all have a different percentage of copper and tin , depending on their purpose .
arrowheads , with their requirement for hardness and ability to penetrate armor , had a higher ratio of tin than other weapons .
and a bronze sword , found bent out of shape from the weight of fallen clay figures sitting on it for two millennia , sprang back immediately to its original shape once the heavy objects were removed from on top of it .
it is evident that the bronze metalworkers of that time were very highly skilled .
the exhibit will remain in taiwan until march 11 . the national museum of history is open from 10:00 to 18:00 on weekdays and 09:30 to 18:00 on weekends and holidays .
in order to give persons with disabilities a chance to view the exhibit without having to fight the crowds , the museum will provide free admission just for these special guests every wednesday at 09:00 .
the wait for admission has sometimes taken two to three hours , but the crowds are likely to grow gradually smaller with time , so it might be a good idea to wait a few weeks before heading to the museum .
in the meantime , you can find lots of information on the exhibit , including a virtual tour , on the internet at http://www.qin.com.tw .

these 2,200 - year - old officers and soldiers stand a head taller than their modern counterparts .
were the men of old really so tall ? or did they only select the biggest and strongest to serve in the army ? or were the artisans simply exaggerating ?
there are many competing explanations on this score .

drifting through a life of art painter hsia yang and his fuzzy people
-lrb- tsai wen - ting / illustrations courtesy of hsia yang / tr. by christopher
the winner of the prize for fine art in last year 's national culture and arts foundation awards - one of the highest honors for an artist in taiwan - was contemporary painter hsia yang .
hsia first became a leading light on the taiwan art scene back in the 1950s , as one of the " eight great outlaws " who launched the island 's modern art movement .
since then his artistic vocation has taken him around the world , and he has at last ended up back in taiwan .
what is it that distinguishes hsia 's work and that marked him out for the national arts and culture award , and what kind of contribution has he made to contemporary art in taiwan ?
friendly and relaxed by nature , hsia yang does n't seem overly excited about winning the national culture and arts award .
if anything it is his friends who are happiest , relieved to see hsia gaining deserved recognition for the achievements of his peripatetic , ill - starred life .
lonely start in life
hsia tzu - hsiang , as he was then named , was born into a literary family in hunan province .
fate robbed him of his mother within a week of his birth , and of his father when he was just four .
his grandmother took him to sichuan to escape the war , and they returned a couple of years later to find the family home in ruins .
when he was nine his grandmother died and he was entrusted to a great aunt . she in turn died when hsia was 13 , after which he went to live with an uncle and aunt in hankou . they wanted to send him to join his elder brother in changsha , but his brother did n't have the means to take care of him either .
at the age of 16 , after years of being passed from pillar to post , hsia joined the army - where at least he knew that he 'd get fed .
" it was a big clan , and it just fell apart ! " says hsia with a rueful smile , the expression of one who has seen life and holds few illusions . hsia joined up in the year that the nationalist forces retreated from the mainland , and soon found himself in a desk job at air force general hq in taiwan .
by coincidence , the dormitory bunk above his was occupied by another aspiring painter , wu hao . the two became firm friends and began to take classes under li chung - sheng , the doyen of modern art in taiwan .
at li 's antung street studio they teamed up with a group of like - minded young painters , including ouyang wen - yuan , huo kang , hsiao chin , li yuan - chia , chen tao - ming and hsiao ming - hsien . together they formed the ton - fan group , and eventually they became known as the " eight great outlaws " of taiwanese modern art .
as hsia recalls , the main incentive for studying under li chung - sheng was that li 's fees were relatively affordable .
other painters charged upwards of 45 yuan per month , with fees at studios run by older , more established taiwanese artists reaching 60 or 70 yuan . no amount of scrimping and saving was going to put that within reach of someone like hsia , getting by on a military allowance of just 25 yuan per month . the only choice was the antung street studio , where the monthly fee was just 20 yuan .
rescuing chinese art the economic constraints and repressive censorship of the era did nothing to deter these young art fiends .
as hsia recalls , the only art materials they could get hold of were red and black ink , courtesy of the military , and pencils .
sometimes they mixed the ink with glue to produce an oil - paint texture . scraping together the money for just one tube of oil paint involved considerable effort , and hsia remembers repeatedly uncapping that single tube to breathe in the lovely scent of linseed oil .
the painters took turns taking off their shirts to model for each other , and hsia would sometimes spend the whole day sketching customers at the ice - cream shop by the train station , after paying for a single slice of watermelon .
in 1955 , against the advice of their teacher and clueless about the risks involved in starting up a new organization -lrb- taiwan was under martial law at the time -rrb- , the young artists formed themselves into the ton - fan group .
people flocked to buy tickets for the exhibition that they mounted at a venue in taipei 's chunghua road , but many visitors found that the art was not to their liking . some , feeling " cheated , " flung their exhibition leaflets on the floor in disgust .
" they cost 50 cents each to produce ! " exclaims hsia , still bemoaning the waste . raising the banner of reform , the outlaws issued a declaration forecasting chinese art 's inevitable decline if it stayed stuck in the past .
only through the introduction of modern forms of expression from the outside world , they said , could the boundless resources of china 's art tradition be revitalized .
the declaration , which hsia drafted , shows that the group 's objective was to modernize chinese art by drawing western artistic concepts and methods into the production of essentially chinese works .
this insistence on the " china " element has been a hallmark of hsia yang 's art ever since . outlaws around the world from paintings of his done during that early period , one sees how hsia rendered human figures using the thick lines of traditional chinese folk painting , but proceeded to dissect and reassemble those figures in a western , mechanistic fashion .
in his painting flying apsaras , hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne buddhist spirits .
critic wang chia - chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . " hsia has also produced a number of purely abstract works , drawing on his deep familiarity with that most important element of chinese art - the use of line . in 1955 hsiao chin went to study in spain , becoming the first of the ton - fan group to go overseas .
he wrote back to taiwan describing the new trends in art that he was witness to , and the other painters , after poring over the contents of his densely written airmail letters , began putting some of those ideas into practice .
taiwan was very cut off from the world in those days , and those studying art naturally wanted to see for themselves what was happening elsewhere .
in their letters to hsiao , all the others , including their teacher li chung - sheng , asked about the cost of living overseas .
one by one , each member of the group set off on his own modern art pilgrimage to the west .
hsia yang , for whom france was the art center of the world , made his move in 1963 , traveling by ship from keelung to hong kong and from there on to europe . the cost of his one - way ticket was borne by his colleague at air force hq chang chuan - jen , who generously put his entire savings of nt$ 5,000 at hsia 's disposal . on the way to france hsia stopped off in milan to visit hsiao chin .
hsia remembers that hsiao 's first words on meeting were : " come on , let 's paint . "
for someone like hsia , orphaned early and shunted for years among various relatives , the support and affection of his friends has played a particularly important part in his life .
fuzzy people , floating people during his four - and - a - half years in paris hsia lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in .
he supported himself doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture . times were tough , but it was during this period that he found what he had been probing for in his use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of his output .
hsia 's fuzzy people were born into his work as if by a natural process . while experimenting with a tangle of lines hsia found unidentifiable clusters taking shape , from which human forms began to emerge . " this was something i really knew i could work with , " recalls hsia . it was a case of " seizing that special thing of your own , " which for an artist is of the utmost importance .
like a taoist priest painting magic symbols , hsia uses line to create human figures and the written word to invoke power .
with rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush he creates fluid , free - floating figures , without faces or personalities , performing their allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm .
the resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence .
it has been suggested that hsia yang himself , the lifelong drifter , is the prototype for these blurry beings .
but then again , which of us is not in transit , drifting through this brief existence ? " as the chinese say , man is a passenger through life who is gone in an instant . hsia yang 's fuzzy people exist very much within this eastern philosophical context . "
so says fu shen , one of the judges in the fine arts category for the 2000 national culture and arts foundation awards . while he was in france hsia received a letter from a friend in the us saying : " life is easier here . "
soon afterwards he moved to new york , renting a cheap loft in soho and supporting himself as a furniture restorer . photorealism was the vogue in american painting at the time .
it did n't appeal to hsia at first , but he knew he had to learn something in his new country of residence , and at the same time he needed to produce work that was commercially viable .
he began employing photographic effects , for example depicting a crowd of passersby on a new york street as a speeding blur . his work now became populated with " floating people " of this kind , although in spirit they were still the fuzzy people of his earlier period .
hsia spent over 20 years in new york , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating chinese food and listening to traditional chinese opera music .
the walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by hsia in language that was part literary chinese and part colloquial .
" i was like a chinese person dwelling in a chinese concession in new york , " says hsia with a laugh .
the biggest boon of living in new york was that this was where hsia met his wife wu shuang - hsi . wu had grown up in a contented home never knowing poverty , and held a phd in philosophy . she met hsia through the painter hsieh li - fa , and since then the two of them have shared a simple and quiet life together .
" feeling anxious when the old lady 's not here , and looking listlessly out the window / so bored of this dumb view , it 's much better when the silly little thing 's around . "
so runs one of hsia 's light - hearted couplets , testifying to the affection that unites these two people who only came together relatively late in life .
going home
hsia returned to taiwan in 1992 , after three decades away .
with a basic source of income guaranteed through an art - gallery contract , hsia rented a spacious , light - filled three - story house in peitou .
the new place was ideal for painting , but at nt$ 35,000 per month the rent was on the high side . hsia 's " silly little " wife was in tears when it came to signing the lease , worrying that eventually they would n't be able to afford the rent .
luckily professor li chih - wen of the national institute of the arts offered to support them to the tune of nt$ 10,000 per month for the first three years after their return to taiwan , and hsia and his wife were thus able to settle themselves down .
" at key moments , a little help from your friends can make all the difference , " says hsia .
financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled hsia to go abroad in the first place and then , eventually , to return again to taiwan .
this is something that the reserved hsia has frequent cause to think about . after returning to taiwan hsia yang reverted to painting fuzzy people .
over the years , hsia 's fuzzy people have taken on a number of different guises , be it as judges , singers , couples , beach babes or whatever .
they have mimicked famous icons of western art such as the mona lisa , millet 's the gleaners , and botticelli 's venus , and now the fuzzy family includes well - known figures from the chinese buddhist pantheon , part of a series of works that examines the role of religion in people 's lives .
for hsia yang , all characters are fair game for inclusion in his work , and all of them end up reverting to nothingness . fuzzy people stand up why is hsia so into " fuzzy people , " and has he ever thought about trying something else ?
the painter points out that he ca n't predict what direction he may follow in the future , and says that if a new theme or style emerges it will be through a natural process , like the one that first gave birth to the fuzzy people .
at the end of 2000 hsia 's fuzzy people at last " stood up " for themselves , becoming sculptures rather than just images on paper .
hsia was fiddling with an aluminum ring from a broken hair - dryer , shaping it into a little figure , when the idea dawned of doing fuzzy people in solid form .
by cutting and twisting pieces of copper , iron and steel , he was able to produce amusing little statuettes of his hitherto two - dimensional fuzzy people .
hsia 's friends were not surprised by his move into sculpture , because he has always been good with his hands .
in new york he once made a hand - operated washing machine from a saucepan and several pieces of wood , and on another occasion he used the motor from an electric fan to power a self - adjusting easel .
in hsia 's hands , all sorts of discarded objects , from sewing machines to camera lenses , are salvaged and put to good use .
" i 'm the leonardo da vinci of the orient , " chuckles hsia .
returning east has brought hsia back into contact with the other " outlaws " who used to dominate the taiwan art scene .
of those , chen tao - ming has since given up art and gone into business , li yuan - chia passed away in britain , and ouyang wen - yuan does n't paint any more because of psychological problems .
however , hsiao chin , wu hao , huo kang and hsiao ming - hsien are all still active .
at a reunion two years ago , hsia declared proudly : " we 're the same merry band of rebels , still advancing as one ! " for artists to produce outstanding work they have to immerse themselves utterly in the act of creation .
these painters , remaining committed to the " pure " creative spirit and thoroughly loyal to the cause of art , are still the same old " outlaws " that they ever were . p. 072

pali : storied past , uncertain future
-lrb- lin i - hsien / photos by diago chiu / tr. by phil newell -rrb- i wonder if pali is jealous of tanshui .
i ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the tanshui river , very differently .
tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers ' memories of its scenic views . pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world .
have you heard this legend ? liao tianding , taiwan 's robin hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in pali , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the monkey cave at laochienkeng -lrb- in pali rural township -rrb- by one of his best friends .
countless legends grew up around liao after his death , and the people of pali began to worship his spirit . in 1958 , his small burial plot was converted into a huge temple . he has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at his temple -lrb- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -rrb- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .
the ko brothers , now in their 60s , recall their impressions of a visit to the liao tianding gravesite : " it must have been 30 years ago , we used to go there just for the fun of it . the road in front of the temple was n't so wide then , and what a crowd !
people were so jammed in you could n't move . " they also recall that the pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .
the elder ko gives a thumbs - up and declares : " that 's why i always say that a can - do guy like liao tianding must be looking after us , so that we have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . "
yet , he may not know about pali 's real heyday , long in the past .
the days of the sailing ships
pali was originally called palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the ketagalan indigenous people . located on the northwest corner of taiwan , pali faces the taiwan strait to the northwest , rests against mt. kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward tanshui to the northeast .
though it does n't have much of a hinterland , its geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the ta - pen - keng and shih - san - hang archeological sites .
later , when han chinese began trickling across to taiwan , they mainly settled along rivers . because pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the qing court designated it to be one of taiwan 's small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland . thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of pali .
however , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , pali began to give way in importance to tanshui , located just across the river .
once mainly dependent on fishing , pali increasingly came to rely on farming . but the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .
while the hardy people of pali barely kept their stomachs filled , their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life . neither the japanese occupation -lrb- which began in 1895 -rrb- nor the return to chinese rule -lrb- in 1945 -rrb- brought much joy or change to this rural area .
but in the 1970s , urban planning came to pali . it proved to be the prelude to a symphony -lrb- or perhaps cacophony -rrb- of transformation .
changing the rhythm of pali life
during the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in taipei , builders put up self - described " villas " and " mansions " -lrb- apartment blocks , in fact -rrb- one after another in pali . also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving , the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world . what had been chungshan road was turned into provincial highway #15 , and the opening of the kuantu bridge to traffic linked pali directly to the busy taipei districts of shilin and peitou .
gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , pali began to dream of a tourism boom . but fortune had other things in store .
in order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of pali , the plan to develop tourism in pali was scrapped overnight . the government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .
then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .
in accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through pali 's land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways . the sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .
in 1997 , the hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of pali . this rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in taipei county , seemed resigned to the fate -lrb- suffered by many outlying areas -rrb- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .
it is only recently that the residents of hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .
lin yi - hung , born and raised in pali , stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where he used to run and play as a child . he can not help but sigh , as he looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : " these construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of pali used to have with the sea . " it 's certainly true that a lot of people here thought they would get rich from the rezoning .
but just because land increases in value does n't mean someone will buy it , and just because apartment complexes are built does n't mean there are people who want to live there . worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved . lin concludes : " i am not by any means opposed to development . but development is not necessarily the same as progress . can the people of pali really survive change of this magnitude ? "
all part of the plan ?
one after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of pali residents . but so far the only things pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an " otherworldly " kind .
the new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from taipei city and return to nature . but at the same time , verdant mt. kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries . even kuanyin , worshipped for her limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing her brow at this rampant overuse of the mountain .
chen chien - kuo , a secretary in the pali rural township government , says facetiously : " what can we do ? we have the mountains behind us and the sea in front .
people say the fengshui is good here , so they come . " he adds , in a far less amused tone , that the government has been talking about making mt. kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of the mountain . but after 30 years , the park plan is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have " snuck in . " " nobody seems to care about our pali , and we are very remote , so people just dump what they do n't want out here .
we say that this is why we not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . "
take the taipei happy mountain colony for example . this venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere . in 1932 , a british missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .
today , happy mountain is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .
li li - chuan , who works at happy mountain , was born and raised right here in pali . her family home is not far from the chil - dren 's home . " when i was small i used to come here to play . all the adults called the kids ' empty - headed . '
i was small , and did n't know any better , so i just called them that too . " stroking the head of a sleeping child with hydrocephalus , she says : " he is so cute when he smiles ! "
located on the margins of the island of taiwan , the people of pali take it in stride that they must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .
and there is no sign this situation will end : reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along provincial highway #15 - right through the heart of pali . serving greater taipei " i believe , " says lin yi - hung , " that the people of pali understand that this is just the way society works -
the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . " thus , in urban plans pali is always assigned the role of serving taipei . " but the government should think carefully about whether they are using the right methods or not .
there are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests . there are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do the people of pali get out of them ? it 's like the port they built for transporting gravel .
there are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people 's hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? "
chang tsu - chou , now in his 70s , has been a secretary in the rural township government for more than 30 years , and loves pali more than words can say .
" i was first sent here to work in the kuomintang public service department . when i came here , they were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of pali . but i went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time i left the department , they were selling more than 1000 ! "
he has great confidence in pali 's future , and believes the new harbor will bring prosperity . " the government says that the first phase is for transporting gravel , but when the third phase is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here . at that time , pali should really be hopping ! "
pali , known as " the home of green bamboo shoots " for its famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over taiwan - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns . and , being marginal , it also must live with burdens that the citizens themselves do not want .
uncertain whether to makes fists or open their arms , the people of pali watch , perplexed , as the great wheel of our times leaves its tracks through their rural township .
yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory . pali facts and figures
pali rural township -lrb- also spelled bali -rrb- is located at the northwestern edge of the taipei basin , on the western bank of the mouth of the tanshui river .
it has an area of 39.5 square kilometers and a population of just over 28,000 .
it is one of the 29 townships under the jurisdiction of taipei county . pali produces wax apples , green bamboo shoots , and wendan pomelo which are famous far and wide for their delicate texture and sweetness . in addition , chinese raspberries and strawberry pears are now being cultivated , with promising results so far .
the main attractions include the so - called " eight views of pali , " the ferry boat scenic tour , hiking on mt. kuanyin , formosa wonderworld theme park , and the liao tianding temple .
pali is served by inter-city and local buses , or you can take a shuttle bus from the kuantu station of the taipei rapid transit system .

emigrating to shanghai : a veteran shares his experience
-lrb- chuang chih / tr. by david mayer -rrb-
the prospect of emigrating to shang - hai has caught the imagination of middle - class taiwanese in recent years , and waves of business persons have been pouring into shanghai since the early 1990s .
but is that really such a good idea ? what happens when a taiwanese expatriate settles in shanghai ? taiwanese businessman chen pin , who moved to shanghai a decade ago , has written of his experiences in emigrating to shanghai , which has sold like hotcakes since it was published just last october by shang hsun cultural publishing company .
when you think of shanghai , what comes to mind ? the grand promenade and european - style buildings along the bund ?
the bustling shopping district where foreigners congregated in the days of the foreign concessions ? du yuesheng and his notorious shanghai green gang ? the novels of eileen chang ? big city , tricky ropes chen pin opened his first business in shanghai over ten years ago . in the intervening years he has run a bread factory , restaurants , and a fast food shop .
his son is treated as a prc citizen , and attends university in shanghai .
a survivor of many ups and downs himself , chen gives detailed descriptions of many of the problems faced by taiwanese business persons in the mainland .
the book describes the property market , cross-strait marriage , starting a business , children 's education , shopping , recreation , and more .
he does not stop at mere description , however .
he also offers suggestions on how to cope with a wide range of difficulties . this book can serve as a " how to " manual for those who would follow in this footsteps . chen offers a lot of very useful insights into the shanghai property market . all land is owned by the state , so when you buy a building , you do n't gain outright ownership .
all you get is the right to use it .
property in shanghai is divided into various categories , and chen explains various terms used in the prc . " foreign business buildings " can be purchased by foreign - invested enterprises and persons with a foreign passport . buildings sold on the domestic market to prc firms are called shang pin fang , or literally , " commercial buildings . " buildings owned by the state are called gong fang , or " public buildings . "
buildings owned by private individuals are called si fang , or " private buildings . " if you 've paid all your property taxes , you are given a da chan zheng , or " big " property certificate .
if you have n't yet paid , you can only get a " small " property certificate , and you ca n't sell your property . some buildings can be bought with a loan , but others ca n't . newly arrived taiwanese business persons often make bad judgments if they plunge into the market without studying it carefully first , so chen suggests the following rules of thumb : the shanghai property market is in a slump , so there is no need to rush into a purchase .
a buyer must be very clear about the purpose of any property purchase .
it is safest to buy property from the shanghai municipal government , the biggest and most reliable real estate developer in the city . one must not estimate potential earnings on the basis of experience in taiwan . you get more for money when renting than when buying . you must stand on your rights at all times , and be very careful not to let friends and relatives use their personal ties to take advantage of you . secrets to success
when hard - charging taiwanese businessmen meet up with their smooth - talking shanghai counterparts , the taiwanese often come away with the short end of the stick . from the vendors at open - air markets hawking crabs or pears , to the proprietors of five - star clubs that target a foreign clientele , everyone in shanghai looks at taiwanese business persons the same way :
" oh boy , here comes an easy mark ! let 's skin him alive ! " chen laments , " the old lady at the market sells beans to everybody else at 80 cents per jin , but she jacks up the price on me to two dollars . "
and this is only a cut - and - dried business transaction .
personal relationships and marriage get a lot more complicated .
taiwanese men tend to fall like a ton of bricks for the pretty , sweet - talking women in shanghai , and that signals the beginning of all sorts of problems . single men practically shout it out : " my girlfriend is in shanghai . "
those who already have wives in taiwan will tell you in a low whisper : " i 've got a mistress in shanghai , and i 'm taking care of all her expenses . "
the women of shanghai are well known for their liberated ways , and it is no simple matter for taiwanese men there to handle their business and emotional affairs wisely .
chen argues that allowing direct travel between taiwan and the mainland would make it much more difficult for taiwanese men to keep mistresses in the mainland , and would go a long way toward clearing up all the cross-strait marital and romantic problems that now occur so often .
chen offers several pieces of advice for all who would head for shanghai , whether alone or with their families .
shopping : " you should establish a reputation for being tight - fisted . " when you buy things , pretend not to have as much money as they 're demanding .
ask questions , and keep asking until you get clear answers before you pay anybody any money .
also , keeping a low profile is a means of self - defense .
you should be careful not to flaunt knowledge or ability . general attitude : " the taiwanese are considered uncultured boors in spite of their wealth .
live down that image . be humble . get to know the daily lives of people in shanghai . " looking out for no. 1 : " you must understand that undercurrents in shanghai are strong .
it 's hard to stay afloat , and many people enjoy watching your struggle ; they 're hoping you 'll go under . you have to understand the legal systems and government policies . you have to know how to operate under the table . markets change overnight , and personal relationships are ambiguous .
trust no one , for no one is looking to save you a penny or help you earn a bit extra .
you 're on your own . " you 're not in taiwan anymore in both emotional and historical terms , shanghai seems very near , but in fact it is a very unfamiliar place .
our dreams , yearnings , and imaginings blind us to the truth , and this especially true of taiwanese business persons .
the book 's subtitle , a meeting of " the taiwanese experience " and shanghai style , hints at the conflicts inherent in the relationship . although the people on the two sides of the taiwan strait share a common language and ethnicity , our long separation has given rise to sharply divergent values and ways of thinking .
when someone from shanghai says , " this is n't a big problem , " you have to realize that he has just acknowledged that there 's a problem , and it 's up to you to figure out how serious it really is . taiwanese ways do n't fly in shanghai . do you want to eat the famous steamed mantou buns at nanxiang restaurant ? shop for antiques ?
visit zhouzhuang , the so - called " venice of the orient " ? before you take off , do your homework .
shanghai is a big city , after all , and there are plenty of " crouching dragons and hidden tigers " lurking in the shadows .

the human resources industry : a cooling economy heats up the competition
-lrb- teng sue - feng / tr. by phil newell -rrb-
as the global economy enters a down - turn , unemployment , like an already - stretched balloon being filled relentlessly with air , threatens to burst and spoil the dream of economic security .
last october , taiwan 's unemployment rate surpassed 3 % , and now more than 300,000 people are jobless .
as the economy fades , business increases for human resources companies , so that the condition of the market for hr firms becomes a reflection of the overall employment situation .
it is estimated that these days , an ordinary person will change jobs an average of seven times in a typical 30 - 40 year working lifespan .
people revolve in a circle whose defining points are employment , job shifts , and unemployment .
so long as people want to find work or change their jobs , the human resources industry has a future .
and the rise of internet technology has brought a revolution to this market which had changed so little for so long . take this job and ....
the largest human resources company in taiwan is the 104 job bank . the firm 's name comes from the taiwan number for directory assistance , and suggests that " to look for a job should be as easy as getting a phone number from the operator . " the company currently has more than 55,000 jobs and 65,000 job - seekers on file .
104 vice president steven su says that there are no reliable statistics for the value of the human resources market , because newspapers refuse to disclose their revenues from classified ads . but , based on the spaces used and prices charged , it could reach as high as nt$ 10 billion , and even a conservative estimate would be nt$ 3 - 4 billion , of which nt$ 1 billion would be in the internet employment services market .
an indicator of how good this market looks comes from the actions of the united daily news group . the udn is one of the investors behind a new employment magazine called biung , which is designed in the pattern of japanese employment magazines , and hit the market in october of 2000 . and last year the udn group also opened a website called " udnjob . " why does this venerable media giant look so favorably on the human resources market ?
johnson lee , vice-president of udn - biung , the company that publishes biung , who has many years of experience in publishing , says that there is a limit to how many people are reached by classified advertising . based on a survey conducted by ac nielsen , only about 3 % of individuals buy newspapers to read the classified ads .
moreover , from a firm 's point of view , lee confesses , classified ads are " in fact rather expensive . " it costs over nt$ 10,000 for an ad of about five centimeters square .
from the newspaper 's point of view , classified ads are n't such a hot property either , since most of the profit goes to the middlemen who take the ads . these limitations to the traditional job hunting formula are unlikely to be resolved in the short term , says lee . lee explains : " looking at the japanese experience , the asahi shimbun has a daily circulation of about 10 million , but only one page of classified advertising . those looking for new jobs rely more on employment magazines . " the attraction for similar magazines in taiwan is being helped along by the current fad for things japanese , and also by changes in how publications are being sold , with convenience stores getting publications on to the shelves much faster than traditional bookstores ever could .
" with changes in the larger environment and the maturing of the market , this is the time to jump in . " " the economy is in a downturn , but the human resources market always goes against the current , " says lee . in japan , where the " bubble economy " phenomenon has been the worst , there are hundreds of human resources firms competing .
the leading company had an after - tax income last year of us$ 90 million . though there have been suggestions that the internet is already becoming the main way to find employment , lee contends that " the obstacles to entry are still great " for the ordinary person : you have to have a computer and be online , and you have to know how to find what you are looking for .
when you consider this , print media is still much more convenient . the big get bigger
the two largest media groups in taiwan , whose flagship papers are united daily news and the china times , began invading the human resources market two years ago , and existing job banks went on a binge of mergers .
for example , career magazine , which has more than a decade of experience in the field , founded an e- counterpart , which then merged with the " 37 " employment website -lrb- the resulting site is now called www.career.com -rrb- to provide even more comprehensive services .
the big may have gotten bigger , but that has n't stopped newcomers from jumping into the fray .
the southeast asia group , which had previously specialized in bringing foreign labor to taiwan , founded the 1111 manpower bank last year , focusing on five main markets : education , civil service , finance , technology , and part - time work for students .
" the interesting thing about the job bank industry is that no rules of the game have yet taken shape for the internet . there is much room for change and flexibility , and no one can guess how much the market might change , " says 1111 public relations manager linda miao . established firms start with the advantage that many people turn to them out of habit . but their weakness is that they have information overload , with no special features . " if latecomers want to transcend the old media , they have to try a different approach .
the 1111 manpower bank has adopted the strategy of ' surrounding the cities from the countryside , ' and is striving to work with small and medium - sized enterprises , " she explains .
finding a profitable market niche is something that all the newcomers have in mind .
last year , yam digital technology and interserv international got together in a joint venture to establish hrgini , which targets middle - and high - ranking managers in high - tech fields who have incomes in excess of one million nt dollars per year .
director janet chen relates that the company employs state - of - the - art psychological profiling services , with job candidates first being screened by a psychological consultant in one - on - one interviews ; only if the applicant fits the corporate culture will he or she be recommended to the client firm .
looking to greater china
one reason that people are so optimistic about the human resources market is the performance of the market leader - 104 job bank .
it began turning a profit after only one - and - a - half years in operation , and its revenues , which were already over nt$ 100 million by 1999 , shot up to nt$ 300 million last year . the company had only five staff members when they set up shop in 1996 ; now , only four years later , there are 190 .
though 104 has commissions from more firms than any other in the market , they do not dare slack off .
steven su says that " we will always have competition from the traditional media like china times and united daily news , " because after all , 104 only works through the internet .
he does not , however , fear the threat from the ctcareer website , which is under the china times flag , nor is there anything especially novel about the exploitation of both the internet and magazine formats by the udn .
last year acer peripherals invested in a combination website and magazine , but they exhausted their capital within three months . moreover , su is skeptical about the survivability of the udn 's biung , " since , at nt$ 20 per issue , they are selling at a loss . " but the people at udn - biung are very optimistic . as johnson lee says : " some people try to open the market with a shovel . we are using a bulldozer . "
the udn group is undertaking a three - pronged attack to crush their competition : continuing to access the wide readership of newspapers , targeting the high - tech sector through the internet , and using the magazine format for regional companies with small budgets . based on past experience , most companies have used up their employment advertising budgets by year 's end , so the market is at a low ebb .
however , when the chinese new year passes , many employees , having collected their annual bonuses , want to change jobs , and this is when the market really heats up .
although the manpower industry focuses on bringing together employers with job - seekers , there is much more to it these days than passing along cvs .
firms now offer psychological screening , career - suitability evaluations , job training , and reassignment of staff .
moreover , all these firms are turning their eyes toward the greater china market .
the 104 job bank has been operating beyond taiwan for some time , having registered its trademark and set up a website in the prc two years ago -lrb- though it uses 115 in the mainland since that is the number of directory assistance there -rrb- .
hrgini 's janet chen says that there is a huge potential client base in the us and the asia - pacific region for tech - savvy staff .
and johnson lee notes : " if taiwan can become the main axis of human resources management in the greater china region , not only will this industry not be adversely affected by taiwan 's economic downturn , it will also not be hurt by the large - scale move by taiwan companies to the prc . "
as we watch the race heating up between amalgamated veteran firms and ambitious newcomers , let us hope that the real winners turn out to be employers and job - seekers .

magazines are also trying to get a piece of the job - hunting market .
p. 108
the husband has been laid off and there is no money for the children 's tuition . what can one do ? women 's groups have protested at the legislative yuan , calling for more attention to the problem of unemployment .
the government will spend more than nt$ 60 billion on infrastructure projects expected to create more than 40,000 jobs .

asian values vs. children 's rights
-lrb- chang chiung - fang / photos by pu hua - chih / tr. by christopher macdonald -rrb-
a schoolchild writes : " when i grow up i want to be a clown " in his exercise book . if his teacher is chinese , the probable response is : " no ambition ! hardly worth teaching ! " but with a western teacher , it 's more likely to be : " go on and fill the world with laughter ! "
in chinese society it has been traditional to place demands on children rather than give them encouragement , and the idea of what constitutes " success " has been fairly narrowly defined .
yet chinese / asian values have been much extolled in the west in the past few years . is the concept of children 's rights , and human rights as a whole , really incompatible with so - called " asian values " ?
as members of the global village in the 21st century , what route should we follow ?
it was former singapore premier lee kuan yew who first raised the banner of " asian values . "
in 1992 lee said in an interview : " for east asian countries like japan , korea , taiwan , hong kong and singapore , group values and behavior have been extremely helpful in the process of ' catching up ' economically .
east asian values , such as the need to sacrifice individual interests in pursuit of the group interest , have been a major impetus for the region 's rapid development . "
group society
according to one survey , asians are more likely than americans to regard such things as " close family relations , " " an orderly society , " " respect for knowledge " and " maintaining group harmony " as important values .
at the united nations world human rights convention , china 's delegate responded to the west 's frequent criticisms of china 's human rights record in the following terms : " the concept of human rights is a legacy of historical development , and is connected with a country 's specific social and economic situation , as well as its history , culture and values .
there are different human rights requirements at different stages of historical development .
countries at different phases of development , or with different historical traditions and cultural background , understand and deal with human rights in different ways , so the human rights standards of one country can not be uniformly applied around the world , in the expectation that other countries will act in line with those standards .
from obligations to rights
from the viewpoint of east asian societies , the west tends to over-emphasize freedom and individual rights , and this leads to serious problems .
but from the modern perspective , the traditional values of east asia are even less palatable .
in the traditional feudal society of china , the head of the family exercised unquestioned authority .
under the precepts of filial piety , children had neither free will nor the right to be independent entities .
one of the tales in the yuan dynasty work 24 paragons of filial piety records that in ancient times a man named guo ju , who was too poor to keep his mother properly fed , proposed to his wife that they kill their three - year - old son - since he was consuming a share of the old lady 's food .
this they duly did , digging a pit and burying the boy alive .
the legal code of the qing dynasty -lrb- 1644 - 1911 -rrb- stated that where parents brought charges against their offspring , the accused were automatically considered guilty and there was no need for a formal trial .
and for most of the past millennium , chinese criminal law provided that unfililal conduct - such as hitting or cursing a parent - could be accepted as just cause in the cases of parents who murdered their offspring .
those old - time filial paragons and legal codes are wildly at odds with today 's notions of children 's rights , and basic human rights as a whole .
according to tang mei - ying , a professor of primary education at taipei municipal teachers college , confucian thought does include emphasis on human rights , such as the expectation that fathers should be " compassionate , " sons " filially pious , " a monarch " benevolent " and his ministers " loyal . "
what it does n't do is propose ways of dealing with a father who is not compassionate and a monarch who is not benevolent . tang feels that confucian thought basically stresses obligations , but that in modern society the idea of obligations is no longer a straightforward matter : when person a neglects to fulfil his obligations , person b can be said to have been deprived of his rights .
but when we start out from the notion of rights , and support those rights with legal guarantees , we find it is better to have guaranteed rights than to depend on everyone fulfilling their obligations .
the best of both worlds
neighboring places heavily influenced by " asian values , " such as japan , korea and hong kong , have a strong sense of how important it is to belong to " the educated class , " just as we do here .
as tang mei - ying points out , this means that parents expect their children to perform outstandingly well at school .
the importance that parents attach to education is of course a strong point for taiwan , but one drawback of this is that parents often set their expectations too high .
at an age when most kids in the west are still playing every day , our children have already started shuttling about among supplementary schools for classes in english , computers , abacus and art .
tang explains that although western children seem to be playing about , they are also finding out what interests them , and they have plenty of chances to change direction .
here , however , the education system gives children hardly any opportunity for making choices , and education is foisted on them rather than being something they seek for themselves .
says tang : " a lot of people these days hide themselves at graduate school , partly to put off confronting reality and partly to continue meeting their parents ' expectations . nowadays we even have cram schools for graduate school students . "
however , the western educational model , in which children are shown respect and allowed to decide and choose for themselves , is not without drawbacks .
one american - who was pushing forty by the time he earned his phd - says that when he was younger , whenever he had an important choice to make about his future and asked his parents for their opinion , the response was : " we 'll respect and support you no matter what you decide ! "
now he feels that he has squandered a lot of time because of vacillation and a lack of clear guidance .
modern parents at a loss
with today 's mingling of eastern and western values , and modern and traditional concepts , it is no wonder that parents find themselves at a bit of a loss .
the difficulty is that they ca n't simply dismiss deeply ingrained traditional notions , but at the same time they need to adapt to the values of the modern age .
the intellectual understanding is there but it has n't yet been fully internalized , and this accounts for the gap that can often be seen between understanding and behavior .
an inkling of this can be seen in the results of a recent online ballot conducted by the hsin yi foundation , asking parents about their " educational approach or concepts . "
the runaway leader , with 21 % of votes , was the approach summed up in the sentence : " i praise my children with phrases like ' that 's great ! ' and ' good boy / girl ! ' "
chang sing - ju , executive director of the hsin yi foundation , points out that modern parents know how important it is to give children encouragement , and this shows there has been a lot of progress .
but there are still pitfalls to watch out for . chang says that many parents use praise without making it clear to the child just what he is being praised for , and this " cheats " the child rather than showing him true respect . it 's the process that counts
a child who is treated with respect wo n't stop studying on account of this . and a child who is free to make his own choices does n't automatically turn into a delinquent .
experimental classes giving pupils the chance for self - motivated study are now being offered in some schools in taiwan , and the results show that these children are happier and more positive .
joyce yen feng , executive director of the child welfare league foundation , an organization dedicated to promoting the rights of children , says that there does n't have to be a contradiction between granting children their rights and maintaining asian values .
in the past , too much emphasis on schoolwork and good grades encouraged the development of a society in which many are crudely obsessed with personal gain .
stressing children 's rights is one way to change that mentality , and there is basically nothing un-asian about using respect and enlightenment to pursue the very best outcome .
in other words , we need to draw on the strengths of both eastern and western culture , to show that asian values are also global values .
east or the west , we 're all human and we share the same values , and this applies equally to the rights of children .

in this transitional era , caught between east and west , traditional and modern , parents have to be ready to respond to new challenges all the time .

high - tech disc jockey : ritek 's yeh chin - tai
-lrb- laura li / photos by jimmy lin / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb-
" mp3 is fine when you 're using it with earphones , but if you try to play it through speakers , the bass just disappears . cds are much better . " recently ritek released a mini disc that can be used with mp3 players or pdas that has attracted great attention on the market .
but in the view of yeh chin - tai , ritek 's ceo , mp3 is little more than a toy for kids . it 's simply not good enough for more discriminating audiophiles .
optoelectronics is seemingly the exclusive province of the new " technobility , " in which case yeh chin - tai , a plastics entrepreneur and manufacturer of phonograph records , breaks the mold .
at the age of 60 , he created ritek , which is now the world 's largest manufacturer of cd - roms , shipping 2 billion a year .
this old technologist , now 73 , has been a key behind - the - scenes player in bringing high - quality products to the world 's audiophiles and videophiles .
hsu tsang - houei , a major figure in chinese music who recently passed away , specially thanked yeh chin - tai when the cd a selection of taiwanese folk music was released last november .
almost all of the musicians on hand for the launch had heard of yeh , but very few knew that he was the ceo of ritek , a company worth billions of nt dollars .
treasure amid black plastic
before founding ritek , yeh was already a well - known figure in the taiwan recording industry .
in the 1960s , hsu tsang - houei , shih wei - liang and other musicians labored hard at making collections of taiwanese folk songs , but they were n't able to release them .
it was n't until 1979 , when hsu delivered an impassioned speech at the sanchung rotary club about this problem , that it struck a chord with someone who could do something about it .
at that time yeh chin - tai was ceo of first records , which subsequently released a series of 21 albums , including recordings of hakka eight tone , fujian ten tone , hengchun - style sing - and - tell , and so forth . it was the best collection of taiwanese folk music ever made . although the series , as expected , did n't make any money , for three years running it won the golden tripod , taiwan 's highest music award .
" it 's not that i 'm especially fond of music or culture , " says yeh , who studied engineering in the last japanese - era class of what became the national taipei institute of technology .
" but my work in the recording industry brought me into contact with peking opera , beiguan and nanguan music , and so forth . i felt that those recordings were very educational and ought to be preserved . " yeh still regrets that he did n't have video equipment , so he could n't also make video records of folk music performances .
back in the early 1950s the 24 - year - old yeh worked with the broadcasting corporation of china to record albums of bcc singers on equipment the japanese army had left behind .
he became a major player in the taipei music industry . " we recorded tzu wei 's first record , green island tune , " says yeh , half closing his eyes as he recalls those days . " who would have thought it would still be popular today ? " later yeh established the platinum music recording studio and went abroad to keep up on the latest industry trends .
the first to bring multi-track stereo recording to taiwan , he made a big contribution toward raising standards in the recording industry here .
platinum is still going , run by senior recording engineer yeh chui - ching , who is yeh chin - tai 's oldest son .
it is still one of taiwan 's leading studios , having recorded such chart toppers as luo ta - yu 's " the small town lukang " and wang chieh 's " a game , a dream , " as well as recent works by chen shan - ni .
cigarette cases and plastic milk bottles although yeh chin - tai has worked in the recording industry , his field is really plastics and machinery .
after graduating from college , yeh opened the mingli plastics factory . their first product was a plastic cigarette case .
back in those days farmers would always put cigarettes in their pockets when they went to the fields , but they would often find that their cigarettes would get crushed before they had a chance to smoke them .
both the cases and the machines to make them sold well all over taiwan . noting that glass baby bottles often cracked when boiled for sterilization , yeh then came up with the idea of replacing glass with polyethylene . his factory was the first in the world to produce plastic baby bottles .
yeh also made the sterilizers , and both lines proved to be very profitable .
in was in this period that he met the owner of the factory across from his , who was a national assembly member .
through him , yeh reestablished connections with bcc and once again threw himself into the recording industry .
yeh recalls a " beautiful accident " : he bought a second - hand electroplater from a japanese and tried to plate various plastic products with chrome so as to make them more resilient . only after repeated failures and much frustration did he think about electroplating his black plastic albums with nickel and copper to make them stronger .
this thrust him into the realm of media storage . " the times change faster with each wave , " says yeh . he explains that it took 100 years after edison invented phonograph records for something better - laser disks - to appear .
their replacements , cds and vcds , are now cresting , soon to be vanquished by dvds , which though next in line are already feeling mini-disks closing in on them . global cd - rom wars
competing in the information age , yeh has seen industries rise and fall . resilient and flexible , he never recoils from challenges .
back when cds were still in their infancy , yeh relied on his old relationship with sony and found a team of engineers associated with the industrial technology research institute before he made a push into cd production .
starting from simple pieces of compressed plastic , they went one step at a time , building a sturdy foundation of technical knowledge that ritek still enjoys today .
in 1990 ritek started to press cds , becoming the first mass - production manufacturer of cds in taiwan .
back then , it cost japanese manufacturers about nt$ 80 to press one cd . ritek garnered market share by undercutting the competition and charging only nt$ 50 .
with the support that yeh had long enjoyed in the recording industry here , ritek was easily able to market its goods . what really brought ritek into the realm of high - technology was developing its own cd - rs -lrb- recordable cds -rrb- .
taking a different tack from the japanese , who were plating cd - rs with a thin gold layer , ritek instead developed a cheap and high - quality process for coating them with silver or aluminum . these allowed for a much lower price that in turn created more demand . it is yet another example of a taiwanese company starting a global price war .
marching forward
being competitive in terms of price is one of ritek 's strong points , but it 's not the whole story behind the company 's success .
another important factor is that at key moments yeh has not hesitated to invest the necessary sums when it was necessary to bring the technology to the next level . " ten years ago , when we first started producing cds , one machine required five or six persons to operate , " yeh recalls . " when a flood of orders came in , we 'd have everyone working overtime with shifts going around the clock , but we still were n't able to keep up with demand . that 's when the workers took the initiative to suggest that we automate . " now everything from ordering and production to storage and shipping is computerized . one person is typically responsible for about 10 machines .
the whole process has been shortened , and quality is high . the amount that the same 3,000 workers can produce has exploded from 200,000 a month to 200 million a month .
automation has meant that the workers have had to learn how to operate sophisticated machinery and computers , so that ritek has advanced out of the ranks of the traditional plastic disc pressers .
automation has also allowed the company to lower costs at a time when the price of data storage media has been plummeting . in the third quarter last year , the price of a cd - rom suddenly fell from 60 us cents to 40 cents , which is n't far from the 30 cents it costs to make . it 's a long way from the us$ 14 that they cost when they first hit the market five years ago .
yet ritek has still managed to maintain operating profits of 22 % , and the falling prices have n't crushed it .
the coming wave of technology will focus on light and small portable data devices such as pdas and mp3 players , so the challenge for ritek is allowing devices that are becoming smaller and smaller to have larger data capacities and higher fidelity .
yeh points out that the patent rights for mini-discs are owned entirely by big japanese companies , but ritek is the only company manufacturing them .
ritek is also part of a group -lrb- which includes dataplay , samsung and toshiba -rrb- that is researching and developing a data storage device no larger than a wrist watch , as well as the applications for it .
ritek will be responsible for the production of the disk .
a year and a half ago ritek invested in the production of oled -lrb- organic light - emitting diode -rrb- displays , which is yet another technology used in portable computing devices that relies on thin opto - electrical film application techniques . currently ritek is the largest producer of oleds in the world . ritek has also begun to explore fiber optics used in the information industry .
last year ritek invested in production of fiber - optic connectors with taiwan memory technology . this one of the products yeh is proudest of . " in the future , when fiber optic applications mature , a house will need a dozen or so of these connectors , " yeh says .
currently , the fiber optic connectors being produced by tmt sell for us$ 7 a piece . but they ca n't keep up with demand , so yeh has gone to the mainland to establish more factories , where he has cast his eyes upon the vast mainland market . on the topic of fiber optics and the internet , yeh is particularly knowledgeable and incisive .
whenever yeh goes to japan he happily brings back lots of japanese books about economics and technology , such as those about third - generation mobile phones , hand - held devices and so forth .
" i study the concepts presented in these books , and then i use the viewpoint of a businessman to see if there would be any problems implementing them . "
yeh has a house full of japanese books and reads japanese newspapers every day . working hard to get a grip on technological trends , he believes that only the far - sighted will end up winners . he often cites the example of the owner of the japanese fast food chain yoshinoya , who predicted as early as 1980 , when there was a great us - japan trade imbalance , that america would force japan to open its beef market . taking hold of the opportunity , he bought a cattle ranch in america .
he had n't expected that strident protests from japanese farmers would delay the market opening . as a result , yoshinoya struggled for many years and nearly went bankrupt . for the past two years , however , japan has been open to imported beef , and yoshinoya has done very well .
and its chairman matsuda has been elevated into the ranks of highly respected model japanese entrepreneurs . early morning mountain wisdom
possessing a corporate farsightedness and determination that is similar to yoshinoya , ritek has been groping its way toward international affirmation .
in october last year , forbes magazine selected 300 small companies around the world that it considered worth investing in . only two were chosen from taiwan : nien hsing textile and ritek . then at the end of november morgan stanley decided to include ritek in its index of taiwan stocks . although these are tough times for the stock market here , and ritek 's share price has tumbled along with other high - priced electronics companies , yeh is very pleased to have received these kudos from abroad .
getting on in years , yeh turned over day - to - day responsibility for the business to his hard - nosed second son yeh chui - jing a decade ago .
yeh chin - tai still holds the position of chairman . as diligent as ever , he still scurries back and forth between taipei and the hukou area of hsinchu on a daily basis .
and he often flies to australia , america , japan and britain to check out factories and investment trends .
" going to work every day is a responsibility i owe myself , " says yeh . " it 's an expression of my will . "
with regard to his son 's strategic decisions , however , yeh just observes and makes suggestions but tries not to interfere .
" if you want to cultivate a successor , you must tolerate mistakes , for he can only grow by making them for himself . "
by participating but not meddling , the old man gains peace of mind . yeh goes to bed every evening at 8:30 , and then rises at 4:00 before the sun comes up . at 5:00 he goes to yangmingshan and starts his walk up into the hills . at 6:00 he reaches his destination and with some of his climbing buddies makes tea in a small farmhouse .
then he peacefully awaits the dawn . " you young people do n't often enjoy that peaceful mountain scenery ! "
yeh embodies a pleasant combination of activity and tranquility that has helped ritek to succeed . his character projects a soft glow quite unlike the brash glare that typically surrounds the new " technobility . " p. 24
cd - roms , which are a kind of optical digital technology , are resistant to scratches and damage and thus offer an excellent long - term solution for storing sound and images .
ritek has been a major force behind their pervasive adoption over the past decade .

" rain or shine , i go mountain climbing for an hour every morning , and i 'm brimming with energy at noon with no need for a nap . "

taiwan 's fitness market gets pumped up -lrb- eric lin / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by phil newell -rrb- in the last few years , tai - wan has been swept by a fitness fad .
clubs offering workout facilities have sprung up incredibly quickly , so that now , counting both established firms and newcomers , there are more than 700 separate locations !
in the midst of an economic downturn , the fitness business is remarkably robust .
it is especially noteworthy that in this new century large foreign health clubs have set their sights on the taiwan market , hanging out their well - known shingles in a battle for market share with local firms .
this struggle has brought the fitness market to a fever pitch , and also is sparking new and diversified ideas about health in taiwan .
" a health club is a playground for adults , that 's what it is ! " says mr. wu , a florist .
this health club in taipei 's fashionable eastern district , with its stylish lighting and blasting music , is more like a discotheque . mr. wu has just completed his step aerobics class .
as he catches his breath , he says that he never much liked exercise , but that in the half year since joining the club his life has been dramatically transformed . not only is his body slimmed down , but he looks and feels much more energetic .
recreational fitness " at first i came just to get in shape . i signed up with a group of friends who talked me into it . but it 's fantastic here .
every time i enter the club and hear that pounding music , i get a rush . and with so many different and fun aerobics classes , exercise is n't hard labor anymore , " he says . and thanks to joining the club , the naturally shy wu has made a lot of new friends .
in another club which offers a swimming pool and " spa " services -lrb- like mineral baths or massage -rrb- , a group of middle - aged ladies who work out in the afternoons sit by the side of the pool enthusiastically talking about the best way to reduce fat around the waistline .
mrs. wang declares : " coming to the health club together is now the most frequent way we neighbors socialize . plus by keeping slim you are less likely to get diseases connected to obesity , and you can look younger to boot ! "
within the last year , gleaming new health centers have set up shop in the tong lin department store in the eastern district , the nova shopping center near the train station , and the spring galaxy theater complex in hsimenting .
in order to keep up with the competition , the far eastern , sincere , and asiaworld department stores will also go into business with health centers this year .
and that 's just in taipei . meanwhile , numerous gyms , billing themselves as " recreation clubs , " have opened in the cities of taichung , tainan , and kaohsiung .
a national movement seeking to find market niches , various clubs are targeting specific market segments . some are for women only .
others , like california fitness centers and gold 's gym , set up in commercial districts , aiming for office workers . alexander , an island - wide chain , is family - friendly , open to all ages . agora garden , which commands steep prices , combines fitness with business conferencing functions . the variety is bewildering and the numbers - now more than 700 locations around taiwan - are astonishing .
rex , an overseas chinese from south africa , who began his career as a trainer at california fitness centers , took notice of this wave beginning to build three years ago , and returned to taiwan to devote himself to the local market .
analyzing the current direction , he says that global trends and the explosion in media have brought western ideas of beauty to taiwan , and the ideal of the " firm and healthy " physique is driving taiwan consumers into the gym .
" people in taiwan are beginning to accept that a beautiful body requires effort , and you are n't going to get a sculpted physique with vibrating massage chairs , beauty parlors , or weight - loss pills , " he says . but people in taiwan have never had the idea , now common in the west , that physical fitness should be part of the routine of life .
a sculpted body alone is unlikely to be enough to get people motivated to work out -lrb- otherwise you would n't see people spending so much money at beauty parlors for a quick fix -rrb- . this is why multi-functional health centers - offering health , a good body , fun , and socializing - are driving the market , so that working out has become a fashionable leisure - time activity , and taiwanese , never known for their love of athletics , are heading in droves to have fun at the gym .
local vs. foreign
in general , you could divide the main orientations of taiwan gyms into two basic types : local and western .
large health centers which are backed by local investors and managed by local people focus on combining the long - held beliefs that fall under the traditional chinese idea of " health cultivation . " these types of gyms incorporate spa , beauty , aromatherapy , and recreational functions under one roof . tang ya - chun , chairwoman of the largest local chain , alexander health clubs , which has 20 locations island - wide , says that the habit of working out must be cultivated over the long term .
many people join with a sudden burst of interest , but drop out halfway . in order to keep business going , and keep people coming habitually over the long term , it is necessary that health centers appeal to customers with " freebies " - meaning gain with no pain . " if health centers can offer not only working out but also recreational functions , then members will keep coming back , " says tang . " modern urban life is stressful and fast - paced , and sometimes a member may be more in need of the relaxation provided by a sauna or aroma - therapy . then next time they 'll come back for a workout . "
a mix of freebies and challenges is better at keeping consumers ' motivation high . while they share the ambition of attracting more people to their ranks , foreign chains nonetheless take a different approach .
right now the most noteworthy foreign group in taiwan is california fitness centers , which now has three gigantic branches .
asian regional ceo eric levine says that he does not agree with offering spa and aromatherapy facilities in a gym , because these encourage " laziness . " but it can not be denied that working out is a relatively new concept in asia . hence , california 's approach is to make exercise " recreational " and " fashionable . "
as levine explains : " we have deliberately put more lighting and decor into our asian locations , and placed them in the busiest shopping districts , in hopes that working out will become fashionable , and going to the gym will be like going to a good pub .
we want it to be more cool , more exciting , and more fun than a traditional gym , and for members to come to the center with the same attitude they take shopping for chanel or prada . " levine says that working out is already part of life in the west , so people do n't go to the gym to socialize .
but asians prefer group activities , and as a result california is putting more emphasis on aerobics classes , with classes every hour all day , so that members can join in any time . each center also has dozens of trainers who provide free advice or paid workout supervision . when east meets west
no matter what tack operators may take to attract consumers , large health centers provide mainly the same services .
besides traditional equipment for weightlifting and cardio - pulmonary exercises , most have made aerobics the centerpiece in the new fitness fad .
there are all kinds , such as martial arts aerobics , step aerobics , latin aerobics , and weight - enhanced aerobics .
as their names suggest , these classes modify traditional aerobic dance by adding martial arts moves , step platforms , latin rhythms , dumbbells , and other props , thereby placing the focus of the workout on different muscle groups .
in addition , aerobics centers commonly provide classes in asian health techniques like yoga , tai - chi , and qigong .
" yoga and tai - chi have not been added just for taiwan , " says eric levine . in fact , the trend in fitness is toward a more oriental approach , such as the inclusion of martial arts or " power yoga " into aerobics .
there is little tradition of athletics in taiwan , and it is too early to talk about any uniquely local forms that can be incorporated into western workouts . but it is interesting to observe how differences in definitions of beauty have affected exercise preferences .
rex , with his many years of training experience , finds it especially notable that " women in taiwan do n't really go for the american female approach of developing muscular bodies . they prefer lithe bodies , and as a result they are much more into aerobics than weight training . most guys in taiwan , meanwhile , focus on the upper body , and are looking for form , rather than aiming to be hugely muscular . "
healthy consumption ?
you might think that local health centers , with more attention to relaxation and " health cultivation , " would attract a higher age bracket , while foreign centers , with the accent on fashion and novelty , would draw the younger crowd .
but these lines do not necessarily define how consumers choose . cheng chia - cheng , who has just finished his military service and is preparing for the bar exam , says that his main consideration in choosing a center was location and convenience . he does n't like the crowded feeling of the shopping district .
" when you work out , the atmosphere should be calm , so that you can use different equipment when you need to and your concentration is n't broken by disturbances . "
liang yung - hwa , manager of the yungho branch of the eslite bookstore , who has been working out for five years now , says that the new clubs spend too much money on lighting and on equipment that people who are really serious about working out never use , so the membership fees are three to four times those of the older gyms .
he declares : " the lives of city people are incredibly busy , and it 's already a luxury to have an hour a day to work out , so there is n't much time to waste on stuff that is purely for recreation .
but if you consider that it costs nt$ 20,000 in annual fees , plus the initial membership price of another nt$ 10 - 20,000 - altogether about a month 's salary for an office worker - most of that money is wasted . "
with consumers like him , who do n't throw their money around , despite the proliferation of new health centers , traditional gyms have not been badly affected . chen ting - yin , the proprietor of the taipei gym , which has been going strong for 16 years now , says that the fitness fad is good for all exercise enthusiasts : " ten or so years ago people had to scrape together a bunch of odds and ends of free weights , which of course limited how much could be done . now there are machines available for training each particular muscle . "
though , he adds , there is also such a thing as too much equipment of little value . fitness or foolhardiness ? fitness is a worthwhile investment as well as being a fad .
but blind following of fads can lead to an outcome exactly opposite to the one desired . chung pei - chen , chairwoman of the department of rehabilitation medicine at the taiwan adventist hospital , says that from time to time whole families take up special offers and join together , but , in her opinion , health club facilities -lrb- except for swimming pools -rrb- are not necessarily suitable for all age groups .
" people over 50 or under 16 can easily hurt themselves lifting heavy weights , so i tell people not to be foolhardy , " she says . the muscles of older people are less securely attached to their bones , and unless a person has been working out since a young age , sudden intense exercise can lead to a deterioration of cartilage , with more damage than benefit for the body . as for children , they tend to think of exercise as just a kind of play , with accidents often resulting because of fooling around .
dr. chung suggests that fitness should begin when young , and those who start very late should stick to swimming , fast walking , and exercise bikes , which are of moderate intensity .
and she adds , " it 's more natural just to exercise when and where you can in daily life - take a walk in the park , climb the stairs . . . . "
be that as it may , walking in the park is no substitute for a sustained workout program . chiang li - hua , a sales manager in a high - tech industry who has been working out for 15 years , from the earliest clark hatch fitness center to the health and beauty center in a hotel today , says that people who work out for a long time truly love exercise , love themselves , and are seeking a better quality of life . this is a habit that is well worth investing in , and people should force themselves to go . " it 's better to invest in training your body than to spend time and money on medical care when you get sick , " she says . as for the future , health club managers are optimistic about the potential market .
eric levine relates that the tong lin branch of california has more members than any of their branches anywhere in the world . working out is not like other consumer behavior : the demand for exercise among modern people will only increase , not decline . it seems that at least as far as the operators are concerned , taiwan health clubs are certainly working out .

scentsory perceptions : what 's the deal with aromatherapy ? -lrb- eric lin / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by phil newell -rrb- the current fitness trend in taiwan combines working out with recreation and the traditional chinese idea of " health cultivation . " of particular interest has been aromatherapy , with its new - age underpinning of the integration of " body , mind , and spirit . "
what exactly is aromatherapy ? what can it do for you ?
aromatherapy involves the use of " essential oils " extracted from the flowers , leaves , branches , bark , rind , or roots of medicinal plants . these oils are then mixed with a " carrier " -lrb- usually a vegetable oil -rrb- or are diluted . there are a number of different applications , including oil massages , fragrant baths , and heating of oils over a flame to diffuse the aroma .
tang ya - chun , president of alexander health clubs , says , " in fact you could consider aromatherapy the latest trend in personal care . to combine this with working out is to combine a beauty perspective with a health one , with more of a recreational feel . " there 's nothing new about aroma - therapy .
people in ancient rome often rubbed their bodies with oil in the public baths as a means of relieving stress , and the shen nong ben cao jing [ classic of roots and herbs discovered by shen nong ] , the oldest chinese medical treatise , also describes treatments which are functionally the same as aromatherapy .
so why the sudden surge of interest ? perhaps there is a greater need among modern people - plagued by stress , insomnia , anxiety , and inability to concentrate - to find a way to chill out .
tang ya - chun states that most health clubs in taiwan combine aromatherapy with hydrotherapy , and include these treatments under their " spa " services .
as tang explains : " in the spa , particular attention is devoted to the pleasuring and relaxation of the senses of smell , hearing , touch , taste , and vision . besides mellow music , soft lighting , and diffusion of fragrant oils , there is also a ' vichy bath , ' which allows the skin to breathe more freely . with an aromatherapy massage , essential oils sink in , and the skin regains its flexibility . " in order that members can really let their hair down , most " spa " facilities are only open to women .
because there have to be specialists on duty , the cost is quite high , so in most health clubs aromatherapy is available only at an additional charge . different fragrances have , it is said , different effects : lavender helps with problems like tension and exhaustion .
sandalwood promotes relaxation and tranquility .
bergamot helps settle the mind . rose is advised for inflammation and swelling , and it also invigorates the skin . chamomile relieves tension and is used for treating menstrual cramps and insomnia . different oils can be combined depending on different needs . does aromatherapy really work ?
ho tsung - hsien , a doctor of traditional chinese medicine , says that chinese medicine has long included some aromatherapy - like treatments , and theoretically it is possible for the medicinal effects of oils to be transmitted to the body through the meridians using tuina -lrb- traditional chinese massage therapy -rrb- .
" things used in aroma - therapy like lavender and sandalwood definitely help people relax and sleep better , and can relieve tension and headaches , " says dr. ho . " but , " he cautions , " the user has to put him - or herself in the proper frame of mind to relax , or else the effect will be largely cancelled out . "
he adds , moreover , that he remains skeptical of claims of wider curative powers for aromatherapy . a miss wu , who sometimes goes to spas , testifies that aromatherapy definitely helps her mellow out .
" but at one or two thousand nt dollars per time , it 's too expensive to go to the health club more than once in a while . i more often buy aromatic oils and use them at home - just take a fragrant bath or heat the oil to diffuse the fragrance . that 's much more affordable . "
it is undeniable that both tang ya - chun and miss wu , who both use aromatherapy from time to time , look vibrant and healthy . is this the result of " essential oils , " or is it just that people who would use aromatherapy are the same people who take good care of their health in general ? anyway , there 's no harm in giving it a try yourself , and you may find your own answer .

the maneki neko has ridden a wave of fashion for things japanese to superstardom in taiwan , and its sales have n't suffered a whit with the slumping economy . not only are japanese foodstuff shops and japanese product counters at department stores quickly selling out of their regular shipments of these feline fortune finders , maneki nekos were even on sale in the run - up to new year 's at the roadside stalls selling traditional chinese holiday paraphernalia , such as lanterns and spring couplets on red paper . they smiled flirtatiously at shoppers from between the potbellied buddhas and the mock gold ingots . amid the crowds and the hubbub at the sogo in taipei , taiwan 's top - grossing department store , it 's clear that these kitties bring more than just good financial fortune .
check out this rack full of copycat charms that have come from japan on maneki neko 's tail . take , for instance , this litter of fengshui kitties , lined up here with each holding a different colored pearl : red , purple , blue , white or yellow . the fengshui kitty with the yellow pearl , which specializes in attracting money , is now selling even better than maneki neko ! foreign cats , local toads but there is no need to restrict our survey to foreign felines . chinese are , as a rule , fengshui experts who will consider the auspiciousness of virtually anything .
for that matter , the chinese display a willingness to believe in the auspiciousness of just about anything !
hence , they have never lacked their own stately or amusing charms to pull in wealth and keep it within a household . the chinese folk charms of financial good fortune have a great variety of origins , an abundance that is due in large part to the chinese people 's virtuosity at making things up as they go along .
for starters , there is the god of wealth on the peachwood charms that people bring out for the new year .
round - faced and smiling , he wears a mandarin 's hat and robes , and his very presence seems to exude affluence and good times . amiable and ubiquitous local land gods can also be seen grasping silver or gold ingots , doing their bit to bring wealth to the neighborhood .
by some twist of fate even the daoist deity guan gong , who never made much money during his time as a mortal , has come to be regarded as a god of wealth .
love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time - honored chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth . many chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers . the three - legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor . according to legend , a daoist master named liu hai and a three - legged golden toad scattered gold coins across the land . if one of these fell into your home , your family would enjoy prosperity for thousands of years . the earliest known depiction of this toad is the " toad in the moon " found in a han dynasty silk painting that was unearthed in the mawangdui tombs . because of the legend of liu hai teasing the golden toad , toads became auspicious symbols revered throughout china ever since the eastern han dynasty -lrb- ad 25 - 220 -rrb- .
according to legend , liu hai was the student of a miserly daoist master . this master turned out to be corrupt and was put into a well for punishment , where he became a three - legged toad . liu hai 's attempts to save his master repeatedly failed . finally , liu hai came up with the idea of tying a silk thread to a traditional chinese coin , which he threw into the well .
when his teacher saw the coin , he could n't help but bite . from that moment , the three - legged toad became a symbol of wealth , and the image of liu hai on the back of the toad with a large gold ingot in his outstretched arms became a favorite subject for folk art . in the 1980s the three - legged toad managed to separate from liu hai .
it came to be marketed as an auspicious figure in its own right . the higher the stock market soared , the more plastic three - legged toads were pulled from their manufacturing molds . you could also buy brass toads that held coins in their mouths . these served as money charms for shops , whose owners would turn them facing outward in the morning so as to attract wealth inside .
then , when the shopkeepers closed their stores at dusk , they 'd turn the toads around , so that none of the good fortune would slip away overnight .
today you can still see three - legged toads at jade markets and night markets . it 's just that with the fashion for things japanese , maneki nekos prevail , and figures of three - legged toads are not nearly as prevalent as they once were . but the potbellied , grinning figure of maitreya buddha is so pleasing that his popularity even today is no less than maneki neko 's . you can often find the two of them next to each other in stores and markets .
moreover , the potbellied buddha by himself is still a popular motif for china , as well as for jade and wood carvings . maitreya buddha has also been transformed into the figure of a monk carrying a burlap sack .
whatever you give to this old monk , he puts in the sack behind him . but as this smiling old man takes with one hand , he gives with the other . look carefully at the plump buddhas found in stores and homes . notice the full sack of stuff that is often found behind them . what treasures lie within ? that we leave to the beholder 's imagination .
money trees and golden eggs then there are the assorted golden animals or other objects that are variations on the theme of the golden hen , the chinese equivalent of the goose that lays the golden egg . the name for the spotted leopard in chinese is jinqian bao , or " money leopard " - so named because its spots look like coins . this name has made the spotted leopard a common motif for costume jewelry . sometimes auspicious objects are chosen for a play on words .
for instance , because the first character in the chinese compound for " coffin " -lrb- guan: ûdì’ -rrb- is a homonym for a character that means " high official " -lrb- -lrb-c-rrb-x -rrb- , and the second character -lrb- cai: s? -rrb- is a homonym for a character that means " wealth " or " money " -lrb- ìö] -rrb- , coffins became popular symbols of good fortune a few years back .
foot - long red coffins would sit on counters in big stores , and people would carry around mini-coffin key chains .
normally superstitious people were willing to break the strong taboo associated with coffins because of the double allusion to the phrase " sheng guan fa cai " -lrb- ìò...-lrb-c-rrb-x˙goìö] -rrb- , which means , " attain high office and make a fortune . "
the owners of the various shops that sell wealth charms all agree that when sales of other lines flag , business for these charms only increases .
they are true " money trees . " with the economic downturn , wang nien - feng , a florist who often works for the television and entertainment industries , has had plenty to sigh about . he reveals that showbusiness promotion budgets have been cut in half .
as a consequence , his flower - arranging business has likewise shriveled . but just a few steps down the street is another flower shop whose salesclerk says that business is n't bad at all . looking around , you notice that there is a collection of flashily ornamented " gold ingot trees " at the front of the shop . these are placed in pots shaped liked gold ingots .
mock gold ingots also hang like fruit from the branches , which are festooned with red ribbon bows . at the other end of the store is a line of long - branched gold money trees .
thick round leaves grow from the branches in groups of four , giving each branch the appearance of being a string of coins . although these imported plants are in high demand , none of the salesclerks at any of the stores seem to have any idea what the proper name for them is . in any case , most buyers do n't ask .
as long as the trees are said to attract money , they are sure to fly out of the store and into people 's homes .
" these types of money trees are the favorite of banks , " affirms the owner of the " tip top " flower store on pateh road . but banks are far from the only purchasers of them . when the economy is weak , shops frequently close , undergo renovations and open up again with new proprietors . these inexpensive and auspicious money charm trees make excellent gifts for friends opening new stores !
for the florists who are smart enough to sell these arrangements made with ivy , shaving - brush trees and " gold ingot trees , " it is only a slight exaggeration to say that their business improves the worse the economy gets !
to bank on fish tanks
but the truth is that objects said to attract money sell just as well in good times as bad , for when the economy is strong , people are willing to spend large sums to ensure that they can hold onto their wealth .
for instance , the stock market last peaked amid a craze for fengshui fish tanks and crystals .
since water is the chinese element that indicates wealth , many business people like to keep fish tanks .
huang chiung - yu , who has been selling fish and aquariums for more than a decade , points out that for a few years entrepreneurs were installing nt$ 200,000 - 300,000 fish tanks in their homes or offices . while the falling stock market has meant that aquarium sellers have had to lower their prices , they have found no shortage of customers willing to take advantage of these bargains . since fish tanks help you change your fate when something bad is expected , and otherwise help to attract money , they are perennial hot sellers . a miss lai works for a broadband internet access provider and is responsible for taking care of two large office fish tanks .
her company has been hit by the slumping economy and is striving to cut down on expenses . nevertheless , there is no consideration being given to reducing the nt$ 5,000 - 6,000 spent each month on cleaning the tanks , let alone any thought of cutting back on the money spent on fish food or the occasional replacement fish . the core pacific ecommerce co. , which just this year got involved in the fish and aquarium business , correctly predicted that the economic downturn would mean an increase in those needing fish tanks to soothe their financial psyches .
with an eye on this group , as well as on those consumers replacing old money charms with new ones or those buying auspicious objects for the new year , core pacific devised a marketing plan to sell the seven major money - charmed fish . the company takes orders over the internet , offers the services of experts who make house calls , and delivers . customers hence save time and energy . core 's best - selling fish include carp , goldfish , and " blood parrotfish , " which are red and round like balls . the market for crystals has also managed to retain its luster .
crystals are said to alter force fields and thereby improve one 's physique , regulate one 's qi , and bolster one 's finances .
for going on ten years now , they 've been hot sellers in taiwan .
crystal markets have sprung up like mushrooms after rain , and shops where a premium is put on color coordination , such as florists or clothing stores , often use unfinished whole crystals or amethysts to add panache to their decor .
huang hao - chuan , an importer , exporter and processor of gems , says that crystals in taiwan used to come exclusively from brazil and russia , but recently mainland china and madagascar have emerged as additional sources of supply .
the growth in supply suggests that crystals ' star has n't fallen yet . huang explains that the price of crystals is n't what it once was . yet sales quantities are up , thereby offsetting the falling profit margins .
may you prosper !
while the hot sales of money charms are no doubt partly attributable to the enterprising efforts of dealers and retailers , the slumping economy and growing number of fortunetellers have also played a part in the boom .
those who habitually get their fortunes told are naturally given to installing a fish tank here at one moment and positioning a crystal over there the next . but recently many people who are not ordinarily superstitious have sought the services of fortunetellers when they 've seen the value of their stocks decline . they might be told something along these lines : " get a dragon or a god of wealth carved in a topaz and the deity taishang laojun carved in an amethyst , and hang them over your chest from a string of chinese knots . otherwise , you can hang a yucai painting at home , and perform good deeds on the third , sixth and eighth day of every lunar month .
only by so doing will you meet with good fortune ! " if you want to avoid going to all this trouble , you might instead consult the traditional chinese farmers ' almanac , which suggests that during bad times people can turn their fortunes by repositioning their water coolers or hot water dispensers .
of course , it 's up the individual to decide whether to believe in any of this . may you meet with good fortune and prosperity in the new year !

chinese new year in the southern hemisphere
-lrb- by lin ying - hua , auckland , new zealand / tr. by christopher macdonald -rrb-
it was the middle of summer in new zealand , and the time for celebrating chinese new year . there are plenty of asian immigrants on the east side of auckland , and if new zealanders can have christmas on a sweltering hot day , then why should n't we asians do something to mark our traditional new year ? thus it was that the united asian association -lrb- uaa -rrb- and the hua - hsia association - a taiwanese organization - organized the " celebrating oriental new year " event . to our surprise , over 10,000 visitors came for the performances , along with a number of leading politicians including prime minister jenny shipley and the mayor of manukua .
the event took place outdoors in howick domain and lasted over five hours . in addition to the hua - hsia association , groups representing korea , the philippines , malaysia and other asian countries participated . the stage was meticulously decorated , with chinese lanterns hanging from the canopy and a scarlet imperial robe draped against the black backdrop , creating a very chinese atmosphere .
there were folk dances performed in traditional chinese costume , and towards the end , a spectacular dragon dance given by members of the hua - hsia association . the sound of gongs and drums filled the air , along with clapping and gasps of admiration from the audience . not many knew how much hard work had gone on behind the scenes for this successful cultural event .
support from the then - representative of the taipei economic and cultural office in new zealand , r.c. shih , was an important element in the event 's success .
the chairman of the uaa , sharon stewart , is a new zealander who is very fond of asian culture . she holds regular seminars for new immigrants , and was recently awarded the queen 's service medal in recognition of her dedication . the uaa holds a " celebrating oriental new year " event at this time every year as a way of encouraging cultural interchange , but every year it is a struggle to find co-sponsors willing to provide funding . on this occasion , r.c. shih 's support led to the event being jointly presented by the hua - hsia association and the uaa .
with the hua - hsia association 's committed support there were more than 30 snack booths present , giving the event the lively feel of a chinese temple celebration . the foreigners [ non-ethnic chinese ] present were amazed in particular by the mass dragon dance that members of the association performed . a few years ago , when new zealand was newly opened up to immigration and there were n't many chinese around , hardly anyone had heard of the hua - hsia association , and inviting government officials to attend such events was always fraught with difficulty .
as more and more asian immigrants arrived , members of parliament - vying for votes - began participating enthusiastically in the association 's events . the fact that the association has supported charitable causes in new zealand for many years , donating time and money , has been especially important in terms of getting taken seriously by the government , and it is thanks to the efforts of immigrants from taiwan that successes like the new year celebration have become possible . for our family , it was our tenth year in new zealand since arriving as immigrants .
our daughter had just turned ten and our son was starting primary school when we came here .
during the tough years as new immigrants we overcame numerous difficulties of language and culture , working to establish ourselves in this foreign land . we wanted our children to quickly adapt to the western world but without forgetting their chinese roots , so we endlessly reminded them that we will always be " descendants of the yellow emperor , " and urged them to merge into western society with the characteristic tenacity and humanity of chinese people .
when the uaa was first set up in 1995 , sharon came to our house in need of assistance from the chinese community , filled with enthusiasm but uncertain about how to make contact with the chinese . our daughter has been sharon 's pal ever since , and it was she who suggested that sharon see r.c. shih about a co-sponsor for this year 's new year celebration .
several weeks before the event sharon asked me if i wanted to design a special garland to welcome the prime minister . as a howick resident and a floral designer , how could i refuse ? i used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered chinese slippers -lrb- as used in chinese knotting -rrb- along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland .
as i put it on the premier i explained that these were lucky colors used for chinese new year . she was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .
with the steady introduction of chinese culture into this country , new zealanders are generally more aware of taiwan than before , and immigrants from taiwan have been working hard to soften the anti-asian sentiments of the locals . when the program of new year performances wrapped up , many new zealand friends came forward to express their thanks , saying that they now felt more familiar with china and were eagerly looking forward to next year 's " howick in the park " !

mourn for the end of an era : three taiwanese cultural giants
-lrb- laura li / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb-
the year 2001 has started with a series of saddening losses in the cultural realm . on the first of the year , hsu tsang-houei , the dean of taiwanese music , passed away after a fall left him in a coma .
then came the news that chang kwang-chih , the respected archeologist and former vice-president of the academia sinica , had died of illness in the united states .
finally , on the afternoon of january 9 , the historian tai kuo-hui died of septicemia . these three masters in their fields were all in their early seventies .
since they had just reached a time in their lives and careers where they could slow down and enjoy the fruits of their past labors , one feels inclined to complain to heaven or sigh about the brevity of life . each of these men was at the forefront of his field in taiwan , and their deaths represent the end of an era .
where should chinese music go ?
hsu tsang-houei had a huge impact on taiwanese music over the last half century . born in homei , changhua in 1928 , hsu studied the violin in japan as a youth .
later , he studied in france for five years , where he became well versed in the various schools of modern western music . in 1959 he returned to introduce modern western classical music to his homeland .
he also published a seminal essay entitled , " where should chinese music go ? " in which he passionately urged his fellow musicians to create contemporary chinese music . many young composers took up his call and wrote difficult and dissonant twelve - tone works that would become the creative mainstream in music departments .
unfortunately , schools of modern classical music struggled to hold their audiences even in the west , and audiences found it harder and harder to connect with the taiwanese modern music of which hsu was the leading figure .
opinion has remained polarized about the worth of this music . hsu was also at the forefront of efforts to record traditional taiwanese folk music . in the mid-1960s , hsu , shih wei-liang , lu ping-chuan and others established various organizations , including the folk music research workshop .
fighting the reigning bias in favor of musical traditions from the mainland , hsu led the way in collecting and recording taiwanese nanguan music and hakka eight - tone , as well as the music of the aboriginal tribes .
these collections helped to delineate the history of taiwanese music . in the past decade , with the rise of the " taiwan first " movement in politics , hsu 's folk music collections have garnered more and more attention , and cds of them have been released one after another . in the last few years , hsu was appointed both as national policy advisor to the president and as the chairman of the national culture and arts foundation . cross-strait archeological star
just as hsu 's work spanned from the classical to the contemporary , from the west to his native soil , the archaeologist chang kwang-chih 's broad vision allowed him to build the foundations for the field of archeology both for taiwan and china as a whole .
in his autobiography , chang describes himself as a " yam man , " which is an allusion to taiwan being shaped like a yam .
chang explains that he was actually born in beijing , though his father 's family was indeed from taiwan .
after taiwan was returned to chinese rule , chang returned to the land of his roots . studying at chienkuo high in 1949 , he was arrested on false charges of having participated in the april 6 incident .
he spent nearly a year in jail before taking the high school equivalency exam and going on to study archeology at ntu . after earning his doctorate at harvard , he took an academic post in america but always maintained his focus on chinese archeology .
largely due to his unflagging efforts , chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline .
his research showed that the rise of chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the yellow river valley . rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . this overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "
though a world-class scholar , chang never forgot the land of his origins .
in the 1960s , he returned to taiwan and embarked on research at the fengpitou site in kaohsiung , completing the most extensive archeological study made in taiwan in over a century . then he went on to perform research in an area that spanned the choshui and tatu river valleys .
it was a huge undertaking that involved both archeology and geology . many of the leading lights among the younger generation of taiwan anthropologists cut their research teeth on this project . unfortunately , chang kwang-chih became afflicted with parkinson 's disease more than a decade ago .
his limbs started to shake , and it became impossible for him to perform fieldwork . chang deeply regretted that he was unable to examine the shangqiu site in eastern henan .
though sick , chang returned home at the end of his life to serve as vice president of the academia sinica , where he worked hard to establish taiwan as the preeminent world center for sinology .
taiwanese heart , chinese sentiments
finally there was the death of the historian tai kuo-hui , who served on the national security council and was admired as much for his lofty character as for his pioneering work in taiwanese history .
his differences of opinion with lee teng-hui had thrust him into the spotlight in recent years .
born in 1931 in taoyuan , tai was educated under japanese colonial rule , and he earned a doctorate in agriculture at tokyo .
back in the 1960s , when taiwanese history was still a taboo subject in taiwan , tai organized a research society in japan devoted to the study of taiwanese history and other related asian topics .
for this work , he was blacklisted in taiwan .
later , tai repeatedly declined invitations from chiang ching-kuo to return .
it was n't until lee teng-hui was president that he finally came home . but when he did , his different perspective about taiwan history brought tai kuo-hui farther and farther from the mainstream of the ruling party .
although tai did n't flinch from condemning the authoritarianism of chiang kai-shek and his son chiang ching-kuo , he also had harsh things to say about japanese colonial rule - unlike lee teng-hui , who had fond memories of the colonial era .
tai , who described himself as an " independent-minded chinese born in taiwan , " never lost his affection for china proper , and these sentiments set him apart from most historians of taiwan . with regard to cross-strait relations , tai made his famous " testicles analogy . " taiwan is a part of china , he stated , just as testicles are a part of a man 's body .
though inextricably linked to the body , the testicles have their own special functions . he based his analogy on what he deemed was best for all of the chinese people . his theory was a far cry from lee teng-hui 's belief that taiwan should establish clear boundaries between itself and the mainland .
but tai kuo-hui never shied from controversy . otherwise , he would not have chosen to study taiwanese history to begin with . throughout his life , he maintained his tough hakka spirit and academic independence , holding fast to his opinions and never compromising . he was greatly admired for his intellectual integrity .
these great masters ' deaths have come at a time when the field of education has been in the spotlight for other reasons . the ministry of education has just formally apologized - 50 years after the fact - for the april 6 incident , and a university president has been found guilty of plagiarizing a research paper .
the former shows that intellectuals in taiwan need no longer fear torture and imprisonment for their beliefs . the latter suggests that some people have allowed blind ambition to sully the pure ideal of scholarship .
apart from causing us to mourn , the deaths of these great men have left us with a lot to think about .

grand justices rule on constitutionality of nuclear plant suspension
-lrb- teng sue - feng / tr. by david mayer -rrb-
the council of grand justices last month delivered a constitutional interpretation on the cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the fourth nuclear power plant . according to the grand justices , the cabinet committed " procedural errors " in arriving at its decision .
the ruling did not specify , however , whether construction of the nuclear power plant is to be resumed . after the decision was released , the ruling and opposition camps came out with conflicting interpretations .
the legislature 's opposition coalition agreed to hold an extraordinary session so that premier chang chun - hsiung could present a report on the policy decision to the legislature . it is anyone 's guess , however , as to when the controversy will finally reach a conclusion .
after deliberating for weeks on the constitutionality of the cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the fourth nuclear power plant , the 15 members of the grand council of justices delivered a constitutional interpretation on january 15 .
in announcing the ruling , judicial yuan secretary - general yang jen - shou explained that the executive yuan 's decision to suspend construction of the nuclear plant was a major change in government policy , and since the premier is required to deliver a report to the legislature in such cases , premier chang 's failure to do so represents a procedural flaw .
the ruling requires the premier to go to the legislature as soon as possible and give the report that he should have delivered there last year . the legislative yuan , for its part , is required to receive the executive yuan 's report . after examining the report , the legislative yuan must vote . if a majority opposes the executive yuan 's decision , there are three ways under the roc constitution to resolve the standoff :
-lrb- 1 -rrb- the premier can resign ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the legislature can put forward a no - confidence motion against the premier -lrb- which , depending on the outcome , forces either the premier 's resignation or dissolution of the legislature -rrb- ; or -lrb- 3 -rrb- the legislature can pass legislation related to the power plant 's construction .
this turned out to be the most divisive case the council has ever heard . only six justices supported the ruling . justice liu tieh - cheng wrote a dissenting opinion in which he noted that appropriations are listed in the roc constitution together with legislative bills and treaty ratification bills , and argued that they should be treated the same way . once such legislation has been promulgated into law by the president , wrote liu , it must be implemented unless it is vetoed by the cabinet . justice vincent sze authored a partial dissenting opinion arguing that since it is the duty of the council of grand justices to rule on constitutional issues , the council ought to state clearly whether or not the constitution had been violated .
justice tung hsiang - fei pointed that legislation barring construction of the nuclear power plant had already been passed twice before by the legislature , and was successfully vetoed each time by the previous kuomintang administration . noting that the project got underway several years ago , tung argued that the cabinet clearly violated the constitution when it unilaterally suspended the project on the grounds that a new party had come to power and its party platform was opposed to the nuclear plant . after the constitutional ruling was released , it met with many different interpretations .
on issues of primary concern to the public -lrb- such as whether premier chang would have to resign as a result of the ruling , and whether construction of the nuclear plant will resume -rrb- , there has been conflicting commentary .
yu shyi - kun , secretary - general of the presidential office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the grand justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a cabinet reshuffle .
the various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the grand justices had in effect declared the cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason . this is not the first time a constitutional interpretation has been used to resolve a political dispute .
what exact role has the constitutional interpretation played in the dispute over the fourth nuclear power plant ?
according to national chengchi university law professor and constitutional expert su yeong - chin , who headed the legal team presenting the legislative yuan 's arguments to the council of grand justices in this case , the crux of the nuclear plant dispute is about the use of democratic means in arriving at policy decisions , and should not be seen as an argument for or against nuclear power .
the role of the judiciary in this case , says su , was to determine whether the premier has the authority to suspend implementation of a budget appropriation . in industrialized nations , changes in policy on nuclear power are a common occurrence , but there is no country where the executive branch makes unilateral decisions behind closed doors . heading the legal team presenting the cabinet 's arguments to the grand justices was hsu tsung - li . hsu notes that while the ruling pointed to procedural flaws in the cabinet 's action , the ruling said nothing about any violation of the constitution or the law .
the grand justices , argues hsu , felt that the dispute could be resolved by having the premier present a report to the legislature , or through consultations between the legislature and the cabinet .
however , said hsu , since the government has not necessarily built up a consensus in support of its stance against nuclear power , another option might be to have the premier resign , disband the legislature , and elect a new legislature so that the public can express its will regarding the issue .
if other constitutional rulings in the past two years are any guide , it appears that the dispute between the ruling and opposition camps will have to be resolved in the political arena . last march the grand justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the national assembly . the justices ruled that the decision making process violated the national assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent .
after the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the national assembly to abolish the council of grand justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .
in 1996 , the grand justices ruled on the constitutionality of the plan to have then - vice president lien chan serve concurrently as premier .
the justices issued an ambiguous ruling stating that while the plan was not unconstitutional , neither was it was appropriate . after the ruling was announced , the ruling and opposition camps both declared victory and eventually negotiated an agreement on the question of whether lien chan would be allowed to serve as premier .
the ruling and opposition camps have now agreed that premier chang should present a report to the legislature , but the question of whether to resume construction of the power plant remains a focus of contention .
p. 65
plans for the fourth nuclear power plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . a constitutional ruling by the council of grand justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

taiwan rushes aid to quake - stricken el salvador
-lrb- tsai wen - ting / tr. by david mayer -rrb- el salvador , an roc diplomatic ally in central america , was hit on january 13 by an earthquake measuring between 7.4 and 7.9 on the richter scale . the earthquake killed hundreds and left tens of thousands homeless .
as soon as reports of the earthquake came in , the roc government donated us$ 200,000 to support disaster relief efforts , and within 24 hours had dispatched a team to help rescue victims .
it truly does seem that " when it rains , it pours , " for india was then visited on january 26 by its biggest earthquake in 50 years , and according to official estimates the death toll may rise to over 20,000 . although the roc does not have official ties with india , as sinorama went to press on january 29 rescue teams from taiwan were standing by for departure , awaiting only the go - ahead from india .
just short of noon on saturday , january 13 , most everyone in el salvador was at home preparing for lunch when the earth below their feet suddenly began to shake violently .
just outside the capital of san salvador , a hillside collapsed in the community of las colinas , burying more than 260 homes and 1,200 residents .
as of january 29 , the confirmed toll from the earthquake stood at 726 dead and 4,440 injured , with 120,000 homes either totally or partially destroyed and more than 980,000 left homeless .
over 600 aftershocks have hit el salvador since january 13 . the difficulty of emergency rescue efforts has been greatly exacerbated by collapsed road surfaces and interrupted power , water , and telephone services .
president carlos flores declared a state of emergency , called for an all - out effort to save lives , and asked for international relief assistance . hell on earth
relief teams and supplies began arriving from around the world on the day after the quake .
in addition to teams from nearby mexico , guatemala , and venezuela , a spanish team also arrived very quickly , followed soon thereafter by counterparts from panama , nicaragua , germany , france , and turkey .
the taipei city government 's international search and rescue team arrived on january 16 .
this team , which had received three months of training in the us last year , went immediately into action after their long air trip , as the search and rescue command center in el salvador arranged for it to head to las colinas , where the worst of the disaster had taken place . the team started out using advanced equipment capable of detecting signs of life under the rubble , including flexible fiber optic video cables and ultra-sensitive audio devices . when these methods did not yield survivors , the team began digging and using more aggressive search techniques . these methods , too , failed to turn up any sign of life . at that point relief teams went into las colinas with bulldozers and mechanical shovels to clear out the rubble and retrieve the bodies of the dead .
in his condolence message to el salvador , roc president chen shui - bian stated that the people of taiwan , having suffered a terrible earthquake of their own in september 1999 , were acutely aware of what people in el salvador were going through .
in addition to the relief assistance provided by the roc government , a lot of aid also poured forth from the private sector . the roc red cross society donated 10,000 blankets and 400 tents . the chinese children 's fund is planning to send us$ 300,000 in private donations via the ministry of foreign affairs to provide support for 2,000 children .
the governments of taichung county and nantou county , which were hardest hit by the 1999 earthquake in taiwan , also made big contributions to the relief effort .
teams from these areas arrived in el salvador armed with experience , an advanced global positioning system , and tunneling equipment . they also donated tents and other necessities .
in the dark days following taiwan 's september 1999 earthquake , the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies donated us$ 27,890,000 to taiwan , and these funds proved a tremendous help in our reconstruction effort .
international relief teams worked around the clock to find survivors , and thousands made homeless by the quake sheltered from the cold in donated tents and sleeping bags .
even the dead in many cases were transported to their final resting places in donated body bags and coffins .
now that a similar disaster has been visited upon one of our diplomatic partners , it is time for the roc to repay its debt to the international community . the power of nature major earthquakes in recent years have claimed nearly 20,000 lives in turkey and over 2,500 in taiwan . the death toll in el salvador is expected to climb to over 1,300 .
in the meantime , the richter 7.9 earthquake in india 's western state of gujarat has completely leveled the town of bhuj , and official sources expect the death toll to exceed 20,000 . while relief teams have been dispatched from around the world , india indicated that it would not need assistance from taiwan for the time being .
there is nothing anyone can do to prevent earthquakes from occurring , but specialists have noted that the consequences of the recent quakes were made worse by man - made factors , such as overpopulation , environmental degradation , and shoddy construction .
el salvador is the most densely populated nation in central america , with some 6 million people living in a territory covering over 20,000 square kilometers -lrb- about two - thirds the size of taiwan -rrb- .
the economy has been developing briskly ever since the country 's long civil war came to an end in 1992 , and el salvador plays an important political role both internationally and in the central american region .
in these respects , el salvador 's situation is very similar to that of taiwan . overdevelopment of the hillside at las colinas may have been one cause of the landslide that buried the residential neighborhood down below .
after one has seen so many dead bodies and heard the anguished wailing of bereaved relatives , it is hard to ignore the wisdom of calls to live in harmony with nature .
it takes a very long time to recover from an earthquake . after the search and rescue operations have come to an end , reconstruction begins . this is a massive undertaking that never proceeds quickly .
in a message to the international community , president flores stated , " i hope that relief assistance has not come to an end . it should continue as we work on reconstruction . "
if anyone in taiwan wishes to contribute to reconstruction in el salvador , they are urged to contact the ministry of foreign affairs ' task force on reconstruction -lrb- tel : 02 - 2348 - 2192 or 02 - 2348 - 2195 -rrb- .

a master of ink and stone calligrapher and seal - carver wang chiang - wei
-lrb- tsai wen - ting / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by christopher macdonald -rrb-
the calligrapher and seal - carver wang chuang - wei spent a lifetime working assiduously at his craft , producing a body of work in which every single stroke and cut looks perfect .
wang passed away three years ago , and this january a collection of 50 works , spanning every period of wang 's life , went on display at the national palace museum in taipei .
in recent years the museum , primarily known for its collection of treasures from the palaces of ming and qing dynasty china , has broadened its remit and begun acquiring newly excavated artifacts as well as 20th century calligraphy and painting - including works by such luminaries as chang ta - chien , qi baishi , yu yo - jen and tai ching - nung .
to those who knew him , the late calligrapher and seal - carver wang chuang - wei was simply " old chuang . "
he liked a drink , as his friends will testify , and stories of his drinking exploits are still told with relish .
visitors to wang 's home were generally greeted with something stronger than a cup of tea , and wang , who claimed that alcohol stimulated the creative juices -lrb- giving the artist a sense of clarity and purpose -rrb- once penned the following couplet : knocking back drink makes the poetry flow / a glass or two helps you find the right phrase .
hsueh chih - yang , who studied under wang and is a master in his own right , recalls how wang liked to open a bottle at lunchtime , and in fact produced much of his best work when he was half - cut .
last of the scholar - artists
wang 's son wang ta - chih , who heads the history of art department at chinese culture university 's graduate school of history , remembers that when he was small he really dreaded his dad reciting poetry . oftentimes the elder wang ended up blubbering , before wiping away his tears and declaring : " great poem ! "
but wang ta - chih credits his father for instilling in him a love of literature , and encouraging him to become proficient in traditional chinese disciplines such as painting , chess , woodwind music and martial arts .
says the younger wang : " for me , my father was one of the last generation of chinese scholar - artists ! "
wang chuang - wei was born in hebei province in 1909 , into an educated family - his father wang yi - pin was the last xiucai scholar - official of the qing dynasty -lrb- 1644 - 1911 -rrb- . but the son had no wish to become an official , and instead opted to spend his days at home , freely soaking up the atmosphere of art and culture .
he began tracing characters at age six , under his father 's direction , and when he was 12 he started learning how to carve seals .
his grandfather worked in beijing , and every year brought back valuable calligraphic artifacts that he had purchased there . young wang thus became familiar , from an early age , with the works and implements of prominent calligraphers from throughout the land .
at an age when other children were still busy at their games , wang used to bury himself among books , for hours on end , in the family library . like all chinese children , wang began by imitating the firm and well - formed calligraphy of yan zhenqing .
he went on to learn the styles of many other masters of the art , progressing in his teens to the running script and grass script of the ancient master wang xizhi , which became central to his own calligraphic style .
love and war
at age 20 wang went to beiping -lrb- as beijing was then called -rrb- to study at the jinghua school of art , and like many other young chinese at that time - when the cultures of east and west were first coming into close contact - he immersed himself in western culture , learning all he could about western painting , sculpture , film and literature .
however , perhaps due to his familiarity with what was best in chinese art , wang did n't take this interest in western art any further .
instead he opted for the life of the true chinese man of letters . in 1937 , following the marco polo bridge incident , japan occupied beiping and launched a full - scale invasion of china . newly betrothed , and with the sterling qualities of a typical northern lad , wang enlisted in the army .
for three months he marched with an expeditionary force to the malaria - infested jungles of burma , and then on to india , before making a safe return .
his young bride chang ming - sui , daughter of general chang jun - sheng , was of a similarly resolute character .
unable to get news of wang 's whereabouts she took herself , along with another young woman -lrb- who brought her baby son and was also seeking her husband -rrb- from jiangxi province to china 's southwest .
now 87 years of age , chang ming - sui says : " many years later i saw what he had written in his diary back then .
though he had no news of me whatsoever , he guessed correctly that i would n't wait in the rear area with the other military families , and would n't go back to my parents ' home either .
i 'm still moved when i think how well he knew me . " for chang , wang was the kind of man who considered things in depth but did n't express his thoughts openly . " grown man "
after moving to the unoccupied zone , wang began carving seals in his spare time to support himself .
it was at this time that wang adopted the moniker " chuang - wei , " or " making it as a grown man " - an ironic nod to the han dynasty writer yang xiong who once said : " carving seals is boy 's work , it 's not for grown men . " wang chuang - wei is how he has been known ever since , and to this day , few know that his original name was wang yuan - feng .
according to hsueh ping - nan , one of seven main disciples of the " wang school " of seal carving , the art combines the skills of calligraphy , composition and carving , requiring not only a deep familiarity with ancient forms of script but also the ability to stretch and compress characters so as to fit them , neatly and cleverly , onto the compact head of a seal stone . as an authority in the study of written characters , wang was highly knowledgeable about different styles of seal script . the 500 or so seals of his displayed in the collection yuzhao shanfang yinxuan show how complete his mastery of the form was , from ancient guxi seals of state , to the qinyin and hanyin seals of the qin and han dynasties , and the styles of the oracle - bone - script and wanzhe schools .
from the horizontal and vertical strokes of hanyin script , to the snaky lines of small seal script , wang performed all with equal facility .
hsueh ping - nan recalls how he once watched wang carving seals in his study , first giving careful thought to the layout and making draft after draft on paper .
having settled on a layout , he would then carve the seal in one go , using the knife with fluid ease .
thus it was that he could fill the confined space on a seal with expansive , forceful - looking characters .
what people admired most about wang was his ability to wield the knife like a writing brush , carving lines that seemed free and flowing . every stroke was made with one cut of the blade - in contrast to most seal carvers who need two cuts to achieve the appearance of a brush stroke .
this was especially so of his signature mark on the side of the seal .
careful examination of wang 's seals shows that the running script of the signature mark is carved with every bit as much grace and fluidity as if done by brush and ink , but augmented by the hardness that is intrinsic to stone inscriptions . for individuality of seal - carving style , wang ranks only behind the likes of wu chang - shuo and qi baishi the western artistic concepts that wang absorbed in his youth opened his mind to creative possibilities within the tradition .
for example , he introduced unconventional themes for the knobs that he carved for his seals . chang ming - sui picks up one tiny seal , half the length of a little finger , on which the knob is a vividly carved image of a dragon coiled around two seashells . says chang : " this is one he made in chongqing . when i first saw it i wondered how anyone could carve something like that . "
chang is herself an accomplished carver of seal knobs , and she knows the details and dates of all wang 's seals and calligraphies . meeting her one ca n't help but feel that as his partner and soulmate , chang must have had a lot to do with wang 's success as an artist , and the long and happy life that he enjoyed .
something new , something old
wang passed away in his sleep at the ripe old age of 90 , and it is said in art circles that he died with a smile on his face .
his accomplishments as a calligrapher can be divided into several different phases of his life .
in chongqing he came to know the well - known calligrapher shen yinmo , and it was under shen 's direction that he began to expand his repertoire beyond the styles of the 3rd to 9th centuries , drawing on the natural elegance of noted calligraphers such as zhao mengfu -lrb- 1254 - 1322 -rrb- and wen zhengming -lrb- 1470 - 1559 -rrb- , to develop a neat , full style , with every character a beauty .
ho chuan - hsing , deputy researcher at the calligraphy and painting department of the national palace museum , explains that the art of chinese calligraphy can broadly be divided into two main branches : the nantie , or southern style , in which beauty of form is emphasized , and the more rugged beibei or northern style .
wang chuang - wei established his style relatively early , and up until he was in his forties his works were characterized by the smooth , fluid forms of the nantie style .
however , wang himself was alert to the risk of his calligraphy becoming over-refined , and he began incorporating the robustness of the beibei style into his brushwork , aiming for a style that was more " raw and intense . " as a result , his calligraphy came to combine fluid grace with a core of doughty toughness . it was a style well suited to the kind of man he was : a bluff northerner with the perfectionist 's approach to art .
when he was in his fifties wang came to regard " writing characters " as a form of painting , and he began to innovate and experiment with the art .
for example , he created " multiple - shadow " calligraphy , in which characters were painted in five overlapping layers using different consistencies of ink .
he tried using deliberately crumpled paper to produce a mottled effect with the ink , and worked on a blurring effect , achieved by briefly dousing a freshly painted silk scroll in water .
despite the interest generated among calligraphers by these innovations , wang was more suited by temperament to the established forms , and he eventually turned back to ancients for inspiration .
he studied in detail the characters on the manuscripts and artifacts , dating back to the first millennium bc , that were at that time being unearthed at mawangdui and other sites in mainland china , and began absorbing their distinctive forms into his own calligraphic style .
he also made poems and paired - couplets out of the ancient inscriptions , pioneering a personal " something new from something old " approach .
" during this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says ho chuan - hsing .
" it began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little . overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink . he had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "
lin po - ting , deputy director of the national palace museum , who once studied under wang at national taiwan normal university , says : " wang chuang - wei drew on traditional styles , but not in a cliched way .
in studying the calligraphy of ancient times he broke through limitations , one after another , so endowing his calligraphy with a simple , raw life - force . " it was during this period that wang 's calligraphic work reached its pinnacle . lifelong learner
throughout his creative life wang loved to drink , and he also loved books .
he was always reading , he liked buying and talking about books , and he was happy to make the acquaintance of other readers .
when students or friends of his traveled to japan he used to ask them to bring back works on japanese calligraphy , or books and magazines from mainland china .
this love of reading did n't wane at all in his later years , and when he found his memory failing he carved himself a seal with the exhortatory motto : " the more you forget the more you need to read . "
wang , with his vast erudition and deep knowledge of painting , calligraphy , and inscriptions , was often sought out for his views by others in the field of art and culture .
for example , collectors often turned to wang for an explanation of the deliberately obscure dedications that the great chang ta - chien like to write on his paintings .
sometimes he would have a dig at his students , urging them to work harder in the future .
huang tien - tsai , who owns a collection of seals made by literati down the ages , recalls how he once asked wang to re-inscribe an old seal huang had picked up on an antiques stall .
wang first asked : " are you sure you want the original inscription ground off ? " without thinking twice about it , huang said yes .
only when huang came to collect it did wang tell him that the re-inscribed seal , which originally read : " roaming in nature makes the man , " formerly belonged to the late - qing reformer kang youwei .
huang was left fuming . forgetting the self
when he was in his sixties wang began to use the style names jianzhai -lrb- " steadily more abstinent " -rrb- and jiansou -lrb- " steadily older " -rrb- , and carved a seal for himself with the inscription : " steadily older and more mature , steadily more mature and more detached , steadily more detached and closer to what is plain and natural . "
during his fifties he had passed through a period of experimentation and innovation , " being different for the sake of it , " but now he returned to the traditional artistic way of " being naturally different . " wang once said that an artistic aesthetic is something that emerges through long years of stylistic refinement and expression .
every artist goes through a non-stop process of evolution , accumulating a kind of natural grace as time goes by . if old age enabled wang to become " steadily more proficient " - as buddhism would have it - at his art , it also made him " steadily more forgetful . "
sometimes , when tidying up works of poetry from years before , he would come across one that he had no recollection of ever writing .
this did n't depress him , however . on the contrary , he considered it an advantage of memory loss that it enabled him to look more objectively at his own works , as if someone else had written them .
with this in mind he came up with another style name for himself : " forgetful old man . " eventually he came to forget almost everything that had ever happened to him , both the sorrows and the joys .
after a lifetime dedicated to the pursuit of art , wang at last entered that state of freedom in which " the man and his calligraphy have both attained maturity . " when wang was young he once wrote the following lines on seeing the work of an ancient master at firsthand : " ink from the brush of a master gives one the sensation of seeing something that is living and breathing , flesh and blood . one almost feels in the presence of the calligrapher , as if meeting him ' face to face . ' "
wang 's calligraphy is still everywhere to be seen on the streets of taipei , in the form of the signs for such institutions as the kungpao building , taipei teachers ' meeting hall , taiwan land bank , and the chunghwa bookstore .
the exhibition of wang 's calligraphy and seal carvings , spanning every period of his creative career , runs at the national palace museum in taipei from january 20 until april 15 . it 's a great opportunity to come " face to face "

this was especially true of the signature marks on his seals . p. 74 wang 's widow , chang ming - sui , and son wang ta - chih , often spend time in the study recalling wang as they look over his works of calligraphy .

reproducing an ancient art : cheng yung - gwo 's prehistoric pottery
-lrb- elaine chen / photos by liu teh - chang / tr. by phil newell -rrb-
in a lively and well - attended ceremony on an unusually warm and sunny winter 's day , the yingko ceramics museum in taipei county is formally opened to the public .
especially noteworthy is room 203 , " echoes across space - time , " where there is an exhibit that seems quite out of the ordinary : rough sandy earth , an upright measuring stick . . . it is more like the site of an archeological dig .
the layers of prehistoric pottery represent different cultures that existed at various times in the past .
it is almost impossible to tell that these rudimentary yet beautiful works of pottery are not the real thing . they are in fact reproductions by the potter cheng yung - gwo . it is especially fitting that they should be cheng 's work , because this unusual artist was formerly a student of archeology . let 's go back to the eve of the opening . the museum - located very near the yingko interchange of the second northern freeway - is hopping with people scurrying and working inside and out .
in the main hall on the first floor stand more than a dozen giant porcelain vases , representing the pottery industry of yingko .
when you climb to the second floor , in room 201 a worker is stirring cement with all his might in preparation for putting up a decorative wall of cement interspersed with ceramic pieces . and in room 203 , a group of people are busy putting the finished reproductions on display , documenting the process on video as they go along .
suddenly there is a crash , followed by a gasp , and lu hsiu - chin , director of the research and collections department , rushes in to see what has happened .
a camera lens has fallen off and struck a yuanshan culture jar .
" teacher cheng , is there anything wrong ? " asks lu nervously .
cheng yung - gwo turns the piece in his hands , examining it carefully for damage . then he raises his head and smiles : " it 's a good thing i increased the kiln temperature to make these things more durable , because i was worried about the knocks they would take being moved around for the exhibition . "
cheng yung - gwo , who is addressed by the respectful title " teacher cheng " by all the museum staff high and low , is one of the young turks on the taiwan ceramics scene . he first gained fame with an award - winnnig entry in the annual golden ceramics award competition .
but the most important reason why the yingko ceramics museum gave him sole and total control over the recreation of the 36 pieces of prehistoric pottery in the exhibit is this : he is the only leading ceramicist in all of taiwan who also graduated from university with a degree in archeology .
a great deal of effort has been devoted to opening new museums in taiwan in recent years . besides institutions devoted to the natural sciences , the main focus has been on local taiwanese history and aboriginal culture .
examples include the national museum of prehistory , taipei county 's yingko ceramics museum and shihsanhang museum , and the privately founded sheng ye museum of formosan aborigines .
for museums , the most important thing is of course to acquire items to display .
but most archeological artifacts are only shards , and the few items that have been found intact are jealously guarded by the institutions that dug them up ; they are rarely lent out . thus the yingko ceramics museum 's only option was to find someone to make copies of the originals .
this was vital because , during the planning stage for the museum , it was decided to establish a very special room to be called " echoes across space - time . "
" we felt that taiwan ceramics should cover more than just what han chinese people have done in the 400 years since large - scale migration began from the mainland , but should also include aboriginal and prehistoric pottery .
but it is quite a challenge to effectively create such a comprehensive display , especially since authentic pieces are so hard to come by . "
lu hsiu - chin reveals that most of the genuine items are held by the department of archeology and anthropology at national taiwan university -lrb- ntu -rrb- or by the institute of history and philology at the academia sinica . hung up on red tape the museum sent a written request to ntu asking to borrow samples from which copies could be made , but that idea quickly hit the shoals . ntu 's archeology departmental affairs committee decided that the museum should have first submitted a cooperation proposal prior to asking for any loans . lu hsiu - chin says with exasperation : " this was not an unreasonable request . but by that point we had no time to lose , and it would have been problematic to file a retroactive proposal . "
after asking around , the museum found an old gent - a specialist in making fiberglass reproductions of old artifacts - who had done similar work for the national museum of prehistory .
but when lu examined the finished products , though the shapes were super , the reproductions did n't capture the texture of the original visually , much less when picked up in the hand .
at this point , lu had little choice but to turn for help to liu i - chang , a research fellow at the institute of history and philology . liu i - chang is renowned in the archeological community in taiwan for his field research .
he has done the initial field work on dozens of important sites , including shihsanhang , tachuwei , and peiyeh . his ambition is to uncover the relationship between taiwan 's indigenous peoples and its prehistoric cultures . he is also the one who was asked to select the 36 prehistoric pottery samples to be displayed at the yingko ceramics museum .
in love with archeology lu asked liu for advice about people qualified to do reproductions of ancient pottery .
she hit the jackpot , because liu happened to have a good friend named cheng yung - gwo , a ceramic artist , who had also studied in the department of archeology and anthropology at ntu .
" cheng was three years behind me in school , and we worked together on digs for many years .
when he was in college , he worked on the peinan and chihshanyen sites , " says liu . peinan society had highly developed pottery arts , and chihshanyen is a multi-layered site with artifacts from several cultures , and the pottery is even more refined . in fact , cheng 's inspiration for ceramics originally came from archeology .
liu continues : " though later cheng left archeology to do ceramic art , he did not forget his affection for prehistoric pottery , and his early work was influenced by ancient painted pottery . "
liu notes that in recent years there has been growing demand for archeological artifacts for displays , precisely fitting with cheng 's familiarity with ceramic art and his understanding of archeological work .
as lu hsiu - chin says , with the satisfaction that comes of knowing one has got just what one wants , " he is the ideal person to do reproductions of prehistoric pottery . "
a ceramicist who reads academic papers in fact , this is the fourth time that cheng has done reproductions of prehistoric pottery .
he previously worked on special exhibitions of chihshanyen and yuanshan culture and also for the taiwan provincial museum .
but never before had he been given a task as challenging as making reproductions representing all the major sites of prehistoric pottery in taiwan .
in the process of making his recreations , cheng was unable to get around the rigid system of controls to secure any original samples .
" what is so incredible about cheng yung - gwo is that he only looked at the samples and took back some photographs to work with , " says liu i - chang .
take for example the human - faced jar from the shisanhang culture . the visage depicted on the piece is of complex design , with sharp angles and corners . for the work to be faithful to the original each angle had to be precise .
cheng tackled this problem by assembling a number of paper models before getting to work .
but he also had to try to duplicate the red color of the piece , a color characteristic of shisanhang pottery .
for this reason cheng made a special trip to the linkou plateau to collect red clay . but he found this material impossible to get into the right shape , so he had to add a certain proportion of general - purpose potter 's clay .
after several tries , he settled on a combination of three parts tachia clay to one part linkou clay , with a 35 % ratio of gravel , and a layer of 100 % linkou red clay added to the outside .
finally , he polished the surface with agate , creating a glossy effect and increasing the richness of the color .
like a detective on a case
even liu i - chang could n't say enough about cheng 's human - faced jar . pointing to the photo on the cover of the brochure for the shisanhang site museum , he testifies : " i was the person who dug up the original , so i should know - the color in the photograph is not right , while cheng is much closer to the real thing . "
for cheng , the hardest thing was the facial expression .
" the face is not smiling , but it is not crying either , rather it looks a bit depressed . "
he says that this is a very impractical piece , so its original purpose was probably decorative or ritualistic .
in an effort to capture the ambivalent facial expression , he imagined the jar as a bust - length portrait of a woman .
she would be an elegantly dressed noblewoman , with brushed hair , and jewelry made from shells , with perhaps an agate necklace . . . .
" during his days as a student , " says liu of cheng , " he did hands - on work at archeological sites , digging up shards , observing , and in his mind recreating the process by which they may have been made . he has always had a naturally deep attachment to archeology . "
liu says that this is probably the reason why cheng , when doing reproductions of prehistoric pottery , aims to capture the spirit of the originals , not just their surface appearance .
even more important for reproducing prehistoric artifacts is good detective work .
you have to be able to reconstruct the general design of the original from clues on just a few shards . conclusions that rest on a single sample may easily be inaccurate .
cheng , using his training in archeology and the concept of " correlation , " is able to link together a single sample with pieces from the same culture found nearby , allowing him to draw conclusions with confidence and to bring his creative abilities into play while remaining true to the original .
reproducing the spirit of prehistoric pottery
stop right there ! you might wonder : if he is making reproductions , how can he bring creativity into it ? cheng 's response is this : " i think that the original potters also followed their whims and improvised when they worked , and did n't rigidly make each embellishment by rote . " cheng considers the problem and then adds : " i not only want to reproduce the appearance of the originals , but also the spirit of the people who made them . "
the reconstruction of an ilan square - patterned pottery jar found by liu i - chang in the town of chiushe is a good illustration of cheng 's whole approach . upon inspecting the original , cheng discovered that the walls were very thin . if the decorative pattern had been stamped on after the clay had been formed , it would certainly have ruined the shape .
so how did the original maker get the pattern on there ? having repeatedly thought about this problem , cheng concluded that prehistoric potters must have used an internal mold when working .
perhaps they had shards that they could just pick up from the ground around them . they could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid .
the stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay . but this decorative effect , thinks cheng , was probably secondary to the functional purpose of compacting the clay . with these ideas in mind , cheng first ground up a handful of gravel , added it to the clay , and kneaded it vigorously .
then he took a mold that had been made from the original sample , and spread the clay - now with the texture of pizza dough - on the outside .
then he tapped it with a small stick , which he had personally prepared by paring off the bark and carving a pattern of squares into the wood . next he cut away the bottom of the jar and carefully removed it . he repeated the process to make the top section , then connected the upper and lower parts .
then , with his right hand he picked up the wood stick and tapped around the outside , while with his left he held a mushroom - shaped object against the inside of the jar to absorb the shock and prevent the jar from collapsing inward .
a careful examination of the finished jar - with its square pattern already imprinted - showed it to look exactly like the sample in the photo . dialogue with academia
to reconstruct these 36 pieces of pottery , as much as he could cheng used the same tools as were available to their original makers .
in particular , he avoided using any iron implements , since none had been available back then . when making the ceramic boar , he went into the bamboo forest in front of his house and cut off bamboo branches by hand to serve as the pig 's nostrils .
when there were no ready - made tools available , he made his own , such as the above - mentioned " mushroom head . " " such a ' mushroom head ' was unearthed at the peinan site , " says cheng , " and archeologists had no idea what it was for . but people like me who make pottery can identify its function with one look . "
liu i - chang states that his conversations with cheng have given him much food for thought and allowed him to more accurately visualize the lifestyles and technology of prehistoric peoples . " we help each other a lot . " for instance , cheng has brought his ceramicist 's mind 's eye to bear on the mystery of why gravel was mixed into prehistoric pottery .
in virtually all archeological reports , prehistoric pottery includes gravel , usually at a level of 25 - 30 % .
some also includes shells or hornblende . this is definitely not because prehistoric people were unable to get clay of greater purity . on the contrary , the clay they used was often of higher quality than clay today .
thus cheng concludes that the inclusion of gravel must have been deliberate .
cheng explains : " these days most ceramic artists buy factory - produced clay that meets a certain set of specifications . rarely would anybody add gravel . after all , everybody uses electric kilns , because they offer precise temperature control , so their pieces can be fired slowly , with no risk of cracking from overly rapid heating or cooling . "
prehistoric wisdom
but prehistoric peoples did not possess any of these things . they had to dig , rinse , and filter their own clay , shape the pieces , then fire them all together in a big pile of wood under the open sky .
this is why they added gravel to the clay , liking mixing stones into mud , to increase its strength and so avoid having the pottery fracture as it first expanded under the heat and then contracted as it cooled .
from this we can see , affirms cheng , that " prehistoric people understood how to use mixed materials , which was a major breakthrough in technique . " cheng found further indirect confirmation of his judgement about the technical skills possessed by prehistoric makers of pottery from a documentary on japan 's nhk network .
in the film , a japanese ceramic artist , an individual who is considered a " national treasure " of japan , goes to visit a small island in indonesia where everybody makes pottery .
when he arrives there , this great master becomes more like a youthful acolyte .
as the japanese ceramicist slowly and steadily works the clay at his wheel , an elderly aboriginal woman working next to him just turns the wheel twice with her feet and shapes a finished ceramic jug . the ability of the indigenous people on this small island to judge the quality of clay was even more impressive .
" they just toss some clay into their mouths and chew it around for a while , and they know whether it is good material or not .
when we buy clay , the first thing we look at is the written specifications , " says cheng with a laugh .
firebrand
though cheng was able to complete the full set of prehistoric pottery reproductions requested by the museum , and at a level of quality that received high grades from the museum and from consultant liu i - chang , cheng himself still feels there are things that he could have done better .
" the hardest part was getting the final color and texture of the originals to come through in the reproductions . " cheng relates that in this regard there were some factors he could manipulate , but others that were beyond his control .
" what kind of clay did prehistoric people use ? at what temperature did they fire the pots ? you do n't get the same feeling from artifacts that have been buried in the ground for thousands of years , exposed to microbes and chemical transformations , that you can get instantly from the recreated works that i am doing today . "
cheng admits that if he utilized extraneous processes , such as exposing the pieces to wood smoke for a long time , he could get the colors closer to those of the actual artifacts , but then he would be losing something else at the same time .
thus , before getting down to work on the final version of each piece , he made numerous trials , using different proportions of iron oxide , trying different temperatures , sometimes buffing the piece to make it glossy and other times not , to get as close as possible to the correct overall effect .
and then of course there was the problem that the pottery - making process in prehistoric times was markedly different from the modern procedure . " these days we use electric kilns . though they are safer , they do not leave the same traces that prehistoric pottery has from being fired outdoors with uneven exposure to the heat . " cheng feels very strongly about this .
in western mythology , man escaped the fate of the other animals by stealing fire from the gods , and it was fire that allowed the rise of bronze - age civilization and pottery cultures .
but now , fire has been taken offstage , and replaced by electricity . the relationship between fire and potters has been severed by modern kilns .
" there is only the moment when you turn on the power - click - there is no physical sensation of kindling wood or smoke . "
back to the tribal experience
after mulling over his experiences , cheng decided that he is going to save up money to build the finest wood - fire pottery kiln in taiwan .
this could not only restore the relationship between fire and potter , but could also induce taiwan 's ceramic artists - among whom cheng believes there is currently too much division and distance - to cooperate with each other .
" this could encourage interaction and partnership , and even in a small way create a sense of having returned to the tribal village . "
now that 's a lovely thought . beside a road in emei rural township in hsinchu , the kind of narrow , winding mountain road where you need to beep your horn continually to warn possible oncoming cars around the corner , in the home that he and his wife shen tung - ching built with their own hands , just next to a pond surrounded by all kinds of large trees , cheng yung - gwo dreams of himself sitting with a group of friends and colleagues around a fire , " alternately firing pottery and drinking wine . "

director in focus : about mayaw biho -lrb- alexandra liu / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
mayaw biho -lrb- chinese name peng shih - sheng -rrb- was born in 1969 .
his father is a native of hunan province in mainland china and his mother is an amis . mayaw biho , who calls himself half amis , grew up in the amis village of cero -lrb- chunjih -rrb- in hualien county .
he never lived away from the village until he went to study cinematography at taipei 's shih hsin university .
after coming to live in the city , mayaw gradually came to realize how mainstream society in taiwan regards the island 's aboriginal peoples , and became aware of the gap between reporting and reality .
he wished to break away from the all - pervasive practice of reporting aboriginal affairs from a purely han chinese perspective , and approach them anew from an aboriginal standpoint .
from filming " aboriginal news magazine " and " our island " for public television service and " declaration of life " for super tv , to becoming the independent director he is today , mayaw has always insisted on following his own ideas .
mayaw loves documentary films above all else . while at university , he began making his first four films , " spring sun " is our name : pangcah paddlers from spring - sun village ; as life , as pangcah ; children in heaven and pangcah artist : gi lahaz .
after graduating , he completed such films as dear rice wine , you are defeated ; national bandits and the land in our hearts .
mayaw 's filming of the story of lukar maku 's life has already entered its third year . as life , as pangcah was only the first part .
during his summer vacation in the first year of filming , mayaw went to live in lukar 's home .
he spent all his time with the old man , and witnessed his perseverance and insistence on upholding amis culture . lukar said that mayaw 's documentary " shows just what it is a person of my age does . " but he also told him : " mayaw , you have to work faster . you must come and see me more often . "
mayaw too urges himself to work harder to finish editing the films he has already shot - of lukar talking about tribal life , hunting , religion and war - to allow the story of the amis to be told on this island where they have lived for thousands of years .
king of taiwan 's snakes - the hundred - pace viper
-lrb- chang chin - ju / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
to mark the advent of the year of the snake , taiuan publishing invited the taiwanese public to vote for native animals to represent the 12 creatures of the chinese zodiac . although taiwan has over 50 snake species , by far the most popular choice for the snake was the hundred - pace viper .
why is the hundred - pacer seen as the quintessential taiwanese snake ? and how much do we know about this endangered species which has been designated a " rare cultural resource " ? " every day at dusk , we heard a loud whistling sound from far off in the forest .
the old folk told us it was the voice of the hundred - pacer . . . . " in academia sinica researcher hu tai - li 's documentary film sounds of love and sorrow , released last year , about the life of veteran paiwan nose - flautist remaleg -lrb- chiang chung - hsin -rrb- , remaleg 's son lavuras -lrb- chiang cheng - hsin -rrb- recalls the poignantly beautiful sound of the hundred - pace viper as he heard it in his childhood in his old tribal village . he also recounts that it was to imitate the sound of the hundred - pacer that the paiwan developed the nose - flute .
traditional paiwan beliefs include many spirits . the hundred - pace viper represents a guardian spirit who protects the paiwan in their homeland around mt. tawu . " it is the spirit of life , the greatest of all the spirits . " lavuras says that 60 % of paiwan folk tales have to do with the hundred - pacer .
in the paiwan village of pingho , one of the two most important festivals was the hundred - pacer festival , which used to be held once every ten years .
" in our old village , the big tree under which the hundred - pacers lay coiled up was respected like a temple , and was seen as the seat of the tribe 's soul , " lavuras recalls .
according to aboriginal beliefs , the only way human beings can live safely on this earth is in a long - term relationship of friendship , mutual sacrifice and mutual support with the animals .
the paiwan images of the hundred - pace viper in lavuras ' mind have never been menacing or sinister ; they are mostly charming and beautiful .
" perhaps today we no longer believe in them as spirits , but they are still important symbols for the people of mt. tawu . "
other taiwanese aboriginal peoples with a close relationship to the hundred - pacer are the bunun and the rukai . the bunun call the snake kaviiad , meaning " friend . " according to bunun lore , if one meets a hundred - pacer one need only wave a red cloth at it and it will go away .
taiwan 's top five however , among the han chinese , the hundred - pace viper is seen merely as a first - rate tonic medicine to boost male sexual powers .
paiwan poet monaneng has written : " the hundred - pacer is dead ; / they 've put it in a big transparent medicine jar / with ' aphrodisiac ' on the label , / to tempt men wandering among back street red lights . / the hundred - pacer of our fairytales is dead ; / we paiwan worshipped its eggs as our ancestors , / but now they 've put it in a medicine jar / as a tool to excite urban lust . . . . "
the human tradition of eating snakes and using snakes for medicinal purposes goes back a long way .
in subtropical taiwan , with its many native snakes , there were once snake research institutes and snake shops everywhere , and people made use of all kinds of snake products - snake meat , snake blood , snake penis , snake skin , and snake venom .
the notions that one can best " fight poison with poison , " and that the more powerful a poison , the greater its tonic effect , have long made poisonous snakes into highly valued natural products .
one in five of taiwan 's 50 - odd species of land snakes are poisonous . the five best known and most frequently exploited are the taiwan habu -lrb- trimeresurus mucrosquamatus -rrb- , the taiwan cobra -lrb- naja naja atra -rrb- , the chinese green tree viper -lrb- trimeresurus stejnegeri -rrb- , the taiwan banded krait -lrb- bungarus multicinctus -rrb- and the hundred - pace viper -lrb- deinagkistrodon acutus , aka the sharp - nosed pit viper -rrb- .
most of taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low - altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . but the hundred - pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern taiwan . it grows to one - and - a - half meters or more - much the same length as the habu and cobra - but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands . since the snake is also sought after for its venom , it commands tremendously high prices .
according to the report " a survey of the commercial exploitation and hunting of taiwanese snakes " by lin hua - ching of taipei zoo , hundred - pace vipers sell for three times as much as taiwan 's other poisonous snakes , and have been known to fetch upward of nt$ 10,000 per catty -lrb- 600 grams -rrb- .
during taiwan 's period under japanese rule , injuries caused by poisonous snakes were a frequent occurrence , so in the 1930s tu tsung - ming of taihoku imperial -lrb- later national taiwan -rrb- university medical college began studying poisonous snakes , and started a trend of research into snake venom antiserums .
snake venoms contain complex combinations of enzymes , and as well as being useful for the treatment of snakebite , they have also been used as the basis for developing many new medical drugs such as anticoagulants and anesthetics .
but due to their complexity , snake venoms are not easily synthesized , so they have to be milked directly from snakes .
according to medical records of the time the hundred - pace viper caused more deaths than any other taiwanese snake , so it became an important research topic . lavuras recalls that the largest numbers of hundred - pace vipers were caught in the period from the 1960s to the 1980s .
as the fingers of development pushed up into taiwan 's mountains and forests , hundred - pacers were forced into retreat everywhere , and in 1989 the council of agriculture put the snake on the endangered species list .
the hundred - pacer is also the only snake species on the council for cultural affairs ' list of 23 rare cultural resources . since then the popular custom of eating hundred - pacers has gradually declined , and by 1999 the number of hundred - pacers which the department of health 's center for disease control -lrb- cdc -rrb- applied to have caught to make antiserum had also fallen to 30 .
regal style
but is the hundred - pacer really the most fearsome cold - blooded killer of all taiwan 's poisonous snakes ? chen tsun - kuan , a section chief at the cdc , states that among taiwan 's " top five " poisonous snakes , the hundred - pacer in fact has the weakest venom .
but its fangs are especially long , and it secretes the largest quantity of venom of any taiwanese snake . however , the hundred - pacer lives in the dark depths of the dense jungle , and its numbers are relatively small . not only does it take a goodly portion of luck for a snake hunter to find a hundred - pacer - the number of people unfortunate enough to be bitten by one is also very small .
one mountain lover who often encounters snakes on his hiking expeditions describes the hundred - pacer as " cool , calm and collected , " and people who have kept or observed hundred - pacers also say they " do n't lash out blindly . "
hu tai - li describes them as " really the chieftain among snakes - they have a serene , tolerant nature , and are not apt to attack people wantonly . "
perhaps it is because of this regal temperament that they are revered as ancestral spirits by the paiwan .
the hundred - pacer belongs to the viper family , which was the last of the snake families to evolve . unlike the more primitive pythons and blind snakes , the vipers all have venom glands .
professor tu ming - chang of the biology department at national taiwan normal university explains that snakes evolved from hole - dwelling animals , and lacking limbs , they are less agile than most quadrupeds . their vision and hearing are also poor . hence their poison fangs are almost the only tools they have to catch food and defend themselves with .
in recent years , tu and his research students have gradually researched the ecology of the viper species trimeresurus gracilis , which is endemic to taiwan , and of the chinese green tree viper .
but few researchers have taken an interest in the hundred - pacer , which lives deep in the forest and has limited distribution .
although it is an endangered species , lack of detailed information about such things as its reproductive cycle , preferred prey , range of activity and habits turns conservation efforts into little more than empty talk .
cold - blooded ? not me ! it was only when taipei zoo began a hundred - pacer breeding program that people had the opportunity to understand the true face of taiwan 's hundred - pace vipers . lin hua - ching , curator of the zoo 's rescue center for amphibians and reptiles , says that the year before last there were six hundred - pacers in the rescue center which had been confiscated from a snake shop in panchiao .
zoo staff felt that not enough was known about the snakes ' habits for them to be successfully released back into the wild , and in order to have some substantive educational content to show visitors , they decided to start a breeding program .
" snake daddy " lin hua - ching says that as far as is known from observation of snakes in the wild , they live largely solitary lives . their sense of smell is an important means of communication , and in the breeding season male snakes are attracted by scents released by the females . in late october 1999 , the zoo began putting the male and female hundred - pacers together in pairs , and one pair took a liking to each other .
the male gently courted the female by licking her head with his tongue . for the next three weeks the couple were inseparable , after which they gradually returned to their solitary lifestyles . in february of last year , the female snake 's belly gradually began to swell , and an ultrasound examination confirmed she was pregnant . in the two weeks after she laid her eggs , the female hundred - pacer protected them vigorously . not daring to anger her , the zoo staff waited for her maternal instincts to subside somewhat before removing the eggs .
in august last year , as taiwan was being buffeted by a typhoon , over 20 eggs hatched out into tiny snakes , which the zoo hopes can grow up safe and sound .
during this first breeding session , for fear of anything going wrong with the pregnancy the zoo staff disturbed the mother snake as little as possible .
but lin hua - ching says that next time around they will gather more detailed data , such as weighing the female snake every week , to make a comprehensive record of the breeding process .
hear the hundred - pacer 's voice however , no matter how many hundred - pacers we can see at the zoo on future visits , it is obvious that we can not fully understand them just by seeing them in captivity . when lavuras mentioned at a symposium on amphibian and reptile ecology and conservation held by taipei zoo last year that the paiwan used their nose - flutes to imitate the voice of the hundred - pace viper , all the biologists present said they had never heard a hundred - pacer make a sound .
lavuras asked the scholars bluntly where they had seen hundred - pacers . if it was in the zoo , the snakes were away from their natural environment . but even if it was in the wild , with the great environmental changes of modern times the snakes might have been " struck dumb " too !
whether hundred - pacers really do have a voice is an unanswered question of biology . but perhaps the aborigines ' open attitude toward and involvement in the natural world , as revealed in their legend of the nose flute , is something even harder to imagine for modern people who received a rationalist education and operate in a mechanized culture .
perhaps in this year of the snake , the hundred - pacer , just like the paiwan people who also still live in close communion with nature , is singing us some long - forgotten songs of life - if only you are willing to listen with your soul .

rising tide -lrb- chuang chih / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
taiwan is currently being gripped by a wave of nostalgia .
if the film in the mood for love , starring maggie cheung and tony leung , shows the face of hong kong in the 1960s , what ko ching - hua 's book rising tide reveals is a story of old taipei , and the author 's little - known tragic and difficult childhood .
for old taipei folk in their 50s and 60s , perhaps ko ching - hua 's rising tide can help them rediscover the feel of that age which was theirs .
and for younger readers , reading the book can be a journey into the past .
incredible !
this elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about french films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined european life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing . who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book - memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .
author wang ting - chun writes in his review " the tide comes in for ko ching - hua " : " i have known ko for many years , but i was quite unaware of the difficulties of his youth .
looking back at his easygoing , elegant style , there was nothing about him to suggest he had ever endured hardship . " essayist pan jen - mu , however , has a much more emotional response : " reading rising tide reduced me to tears !
for he has expressed all the distress and privations of our youth . "
the images revealed in rising tide are many - faceted . there are the joys and sorrows of the author 's childhood and teenage years ; there are the twists and turns of his love , marriage and his first excursions into the literary world ; there is the nostalgia of an old taipei resident for taipei 's past ; and there is also the beautiful story of a literary gardener tilling the soil of his dreams .
ko ching - hua -lrb- whose close friends call him " old k " -rrb- can be called the doyen of taiwan 's literary world . his ancestral home was in yongjia , zhejiang province . born in shanghai in 1937 , at the age of seven he was taken by his parents to kunshan in jiangsu province , to be looked after by a family named gu . they were rice farmers , and young ko had to work in the fields , planting rice seedlings and so on .
when he was ten , his father brought him to taiwan , via shanghai . after they disembarked at keelung , ko ching - hua wept all the way as they walked from the pier , past jen - ai road and to their home in ningpo west street . it was only when he heard the sound of peking opera singing coming out of a square wooden box that he stopped crying and asked in bewilderment , " is there someone in the box ? " this moment of childish wonder raised the curtain on the drama of his life in taiwan .
the poor fear moving house however , he never imagined that the role he was called upon to play would be so lonely and dismal .
recalling this time so many years later , he still feels pangs of nostalgia for his parents , despite their ill - treatment of him .
his mother and father did not get on well together , and after constant arguments they finally divorced . destitute , the family split up and went their separate ways .
ko ching - hua 's father ko hao was a graduate of the foreign languages department at hangzhou 's zhijiang university , and taught english at taipei first girls ' high school .
but in ko ching - hua 's eyes , he was nothing but a spineless , gullible fool . it was this spineless father who caused ko 's childhood to be spent in constant house moving . in his book , ko describes his feelings during that time thus : " the poor fear hunger , and also moving house . "
their series of temporary homes even included an air raid shelter which kept out neither the wind nor the rain , and was not fit for human habitation . apart from the problem of accommodation which blighted ko ching - hua 's childhood , as a teenager he had to do jobs like selling newspapers and delivering coal briquettes to earn his school fees , so he could finish his schooling .
ko sums up the poverty which so often made him uncertain where his next meal was coming from , with the simple words : " hunger is a beast with a painful bite . " but what anguish lies behind those words ! ko ching - hua 's status in taiwan 's publishing business goes without saying .
in the 25 years since he set up elite publishing , which specializes completely in works of literature , he has published many influential books , ranging from wang ting - chun 's open life and chi chun 's dreaming with a book for a pillow to chang to - wu 's horses and foot - soldiers and yu chiu - yu 's a bitter cultural journey .
ko , who has spent his career publishing other people 's books , had no idea that when he wrote the story of his own childhood it would elicit such a broad response among readers and literature lovers .
he says cheerfully : " i 've made others weep , but i 've made myself laugh . "
writing the book was a cathartic experience which wiped away the sense of inferiority , the loneliness and the desolation he experienced as a child , so once the book was finished his mood was relaxed and happy . no wonder ko says he is now the happiest of men in an unhappy environment .
walking amid the hubbub of taipei today , on streets filled with people and traffic , ko - nan street , shanghai road , the tri-service stadium and the star cafe have long since drifted away like the sound of ko lan 's mambo song .
once - familiar scenes are gone with the wind , leaving old taipei resident ko ching - hua somewhat forlorn .
ko , who likens himself to a peasant in an industrial society , has always insisted on publishing high - quality literature for the common man .
speaking of the future , he says with a smile that he is planning a long novel .
this is surely something for all of us who love ko ching - hua 's writing to look forward to .

in the groove , or in a rut ? - life in middle age
-lrb- laura li / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
middle age is the most awkward time .
it 's the age when you ca n't get to sleep till dawn .
the age of sighs but not passion .
the age of sorrow but not anger .
in middle age , you kiss girls on the forehead , not the lips .
it 's the age when you drink strong coffee and take stomach pills .
the age when the phrase " you ca n't escape convention " says it all .
middle age is afternoon tea .
-lrb- from " middle age is afternoon tea , " by tung chiao -rrb-
" middle age is the afternoon , but i ca n't say i have much time to drink tea ! "
sitting in the silence of his research office , professor li liang - che of the psychology department at national chengchi university appears pensive .
indeed , passing 40 is like passing noon . you miss the fresh , pure , carefree feeling of morning , and the arrogance of noon , yet also yearn for the serene splendor of the sunset .
it is only now , in the afternoon , that worries crowd in , and try as you might you can not raise your flagging spirits .
worries , ennui - is this a case of that fashionable disease of civilization , the " midlife crisis " ?
" if you 're going to have a crisis , it 's most likely to happen during the " midlife transition , " from 40 to 45 , " says li . in people of a melancholy and sensitive disposition , or who have faced many setbacks early in life , it may even set in around the age of 35 .
" in the us , 35 is the maximum age for being in a fraternity , " jokes national taiwan normal university audiovisual center director chao ning , who is known as a " wunderkind " in the broadcasting world .
after that , your moods begin to seesaw between those of " youth " and " middle age . " you are perfectly sure that you are in as good form as ever , and have not even reached your peak yet , but looking at all those talented youngsters around you , they seem even more outstanding than yourself , and more like tomorrow 's rising stars .
a vexing feeling of being pushed along by the years gradually builds up , until one day you find yourself high and dry on the shoals of life .
middle age creeps up on you
" the new waves on the yangtze river push the old waves along " - i.e. each generation outdoes the last - and in an age of rapid change , the sense of crisis this induces in the older generations is amplified .
a mrs. wei , who chose to leave her job as a bookkeeper five years ago because of an unexpected pregnancy , thought at the time that with her ability , experience and contacts it would not be hard for her to find a new job once her child started primary school .
but as the day of her return to the world of work draws ever nearer , she feels a growing sense of panic .
" most of my old colleagues have left , and the few i 'm still in touch with talk about nothing but things like excel spreadsheets that i know nothing about ! " mrs. wei has hinted a few times to her husband that she should just stay at home and concentrate on looking after the children .
but thinking of her husband 's grim expression whenever he gives her the housekeeping money , she does n't dare to say it plainly .
in today 's society , youth is beauty .
but in trying to show he was not out of touch with youth , mr. chou , the 45 - year - old boss of a computer components company , had an experience which left him not knowing whether to laugh or cry .
he arranged with his young employees to go for a barbecue in a river valley , hoping to get to know them better .
but when they arrived there , the workers formed their own groups , laughing and clowning around , and left him to get on with barbecuing the meat . when it was done - and he was drenched in sweat - the young people , attracted by the aroma , gathered round .
but after giving him a few words of praise , they wolfed down the food and scattered again immediately , as if he did n't even exist . " they probably thought their old fogey of a boss had just come to wait on them ! "
from then on mr. chou , having recognized his own place in the order of things , made no more attempts to ingratiate himself with his young employees - and in fact felt much the more relaxed for it .
more crises in middle age ? " by middle age , you have more experience of life , and you are sure to have various realizations and regrets , " says li liang - che .
even if you have no economic worries and as yet no health problems , nonetheless the flowing river of life has carried away your youth , ideals , pure love and even your loved ones , and left you with many wounds you are loth to touch and regrets you are loth to remember .
the sense that the realization of past mistakes has come too late to put them right , and of your remaining days being numbered , makes you feel despondent .
but despondency need not amount to a " crisis . "
according to overseas research , although people have more worries in middle age , only around 15 % have emotional difficulties serious enough to require psychological counseling or medication .
sociology professor wang ya - ke of national taipei university , who has always been an ardent supporter of feminism and recently became the first scholar to promote " male studies " in taiwan , offers the following analysis : the real reason why the " midlife crisis " has become such a hot topic in the us lies with the 75 million " baby boomers " born in the postwar period from 1946 to 1964 .
one can say that this huge generation is the one with the highest level of achievement , and the most diverse set of values , in human history .
since they gradually began to enter middle age in the late 1980s , they have produced many reminiscences and introspective works about their own mental and spiritual journey , which have elicited a strong response .
the us 's present middle - aged generation have metamorphosed from youthful anti-war protesters and hippies into yuppie managers of multinational corporations , and from idealists into materialists . the tensions and trauma of that transformation cause their " midlife crisis " to be especially complex .
by contrast , although taiwan had its own baby boom from 1951 to 1966 , its middle - aged generation have not had the same life experiences , so while they too have their midlife crises , they are much less complex .
alice lu , director of the international family life education center , suggests that " change " would be a better term than " crisis " for the mood swings and difficulties of middle age .
midlife change , in fact , is a natural process in the journey of life , and as people grow older and have to shoulder ever heavier responsibilities , all kinds of pressures large and small appear together at this time of life .
for example , says lu , middle - aged people are the meat in a generational sandwich . their aging parents increasingly need care , while at the same time their teenage children are at their most rebellious .
other elements in their lives , such as their job or marriage , have been in existence for ten to 20 years ; the sparkle is gone , yet they have invested too much to just walk away from them .
and again , turning to look at themselves , gray hairs are sprouting from their temples and crows ' feet appearing at the corners of their eyes , their jowls are sagging , and the thick , solid chest muscles of their youth have somehow migrated down to their bellies . when they take their sons out for some exercise , they do n't even have the strength to do a single pull - up !
midlife brings many uncertainties , and if it comes in a time of dramatic social change when many role models are being completely rewritten , middle - aged people may be left even more at a loss .
life is long , the future bleak
li liang - che notes that firstly , life expectancy has rapidly increased . in taiwan , average life expectancy has risen steadily from 55 years in 1951 to 75 today . as the journey of life lengthens , middle - aged people become more and more confused about their status in life .
a mr. chang , who lives in hualien , is now 58 , nearing the upper end of middle age . he recalls that when he saw his parents at age 60 he thought they were " ever so old , " and they seemed quite content to dandle their grandchildren , oblivious to the affairs of the world .
but now that he is approaching the same age himself , he feels he is not yet qualified to call himself old , and still less to speak lightly of retiring .
" we 're living longer , but life is more tiring ! "
he asks , only half in jest : how come nowadays middle age seems to drag on forever ?
with longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences .
in middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .
at the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time . with more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even - as for many expatriate taiwanese business people - in different countries , many middle - aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .
hospital worker lin mei - lun -lrb- not her real name -rrb- , lives in kaohsiung with her two children . her ex-husband works in tainan , and for many years during their marriage he only came home at weekends .
early last year a late - night phone call shattered the peaceful life she had worked so hard to build . at the other end was a woman who venomously demanded that lin mei - lun give up her husband , or she would bring along her three - and - a - half - year - old illegitimate son and make a scene at the hospital !
the unbearable anguish of being
" actually , it 's not as if i did n't have my suspicions all those years . but i never thought things would turn out so awful !
how could i have been such a fool ? " for the next six months , lin mei - lun could hardly sleep or eat . by day she dragged herself to work like a zombie , but in the middle of the night she would wake with a start , her heart pounding so hard she could n't breathe .
the affair finally ended in divorce , but the upside is that since then her ex has actually behaved better , for he has begun to commute back to kaohsiung from tainan every day , and is much more patient with his son and daughter than before .
at present they are planning to remarry , but lin worries that once her husband is again bound by the chains of marriage , he might return to his old ways .
" life in middle age is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle in a gale . the more you look at the parts you 've already assembled , the more disjointed and ugly they seem ; but it 's the parts you ca n't finish that you long for more and more , even though you know there 's precious little hope you 'll ever get them done . " ms. lin , who turned 40 this year , says with an air of resignation that if a gust of wind blows the whole puzzle away , the sense of dismay and panic at being tricked by fate can drive you to distraction .
lin mei - lun 's mother often comes to stay , and this has done much to lighten the burden of running her household . but many people who arrive in middle age without the support of a family can only try to weather life 's storms alone .
ms. chiang , still single at 46 , is an example .
when she worked as a pr manager for foreign companies such as hewlett - packard and texas instruments , she was always the highly effective superwoman .
but she realized that under the dual pressure of her need for career success and her unfulfilled emotional needs , she was approaching a state of psychological collapse .
two years ago , she became seriously depressed .
at night she would toss and turn in bed , but the worry that lack of sleep would make her unable to get up in the morning and would affect her work performance made her even less able to sleep .
years of looking at a computer screen was causing her vision to deteriorate rapidly , and due to working in a sealed high - tech office she was always dogged by colds , so that every day she felt under the weather . live for today " i asked myself , do you really want to carry on like this ? what matters more , your work or your health ? "
ms. chiang had accumulated some savings during her many years at work , but for the first three months after she resigned her job she could not help a sense of panic , feeling anxious that she might be cast out by society , and also fearing the accusing looks of her friends and family .
but gradually she began to learn to relax and let go . " zhuangzi says that life is toil and that death is the time for rest , but i do n't believe all that . it should n't be that way ! "
after three months , ms. chiang no longer put herself under pressure , and no longer got worked up about other people 's well - meaning advice .
once she stopped having to get up early to go to work , her anxiety about insomnia decreased greatly , and when she was able to adjust her living habits according to her own needs , her depression cleared up by itself .
she began decorating her flat , going to the gym , and cooking the food she likes , and even just sitting lost in thought , enjoying the empty spaces in life .
in particular , having freed herself from the barren existence of a " sexless wage slave " she has begun to liberate her emotional side and enjoy the pleasure of being a woman .
on the subject of family affection and affairs of the heart , ms. chiang has also come to a realization .
" my mother died young , and my father always regarded us three children as bloodsuckers , and never showed us any love . " because of this , ms. chiang left home early to live independently . but in her heart , her desire for love has never ceased .
perhaps the shadow of her childhood is behind the setbacks in her love life , so that even today she is still single . at present , ms. chiang has a boyfriend ten years her junior .
" we do n't constrain each other or force each other into anything . we 're only together when we really want to be . " the year before last when her father was dangerously ill , he constantly rang his children , begging for their love , which aroused both her sympathy and her disgust .
having seen through the inconstancy of family affection and romantic attachments , she swore never again to put her emotions at the mercy of others .
she wants to live truly at ease and without being tied down .
keeping loneliness at bay for ms. chiang , the single life has its freedoms and its loneliness . but do those who are surrounded by a family have more peace of mind and happiness ?
" no , not necessarily , " answers 51 - year - old hsiang chi - tai , a manager at a newspaper , shaking her head .
for the last two years hsiang chi - tai has been plagued with capsulitis in her shoulder , and one morning when she could n't manage to fasten her bra before setting off for work , she woke up her son , a university student , to help her . but her son said banteringly : " you old women really are a pain ! "
once , ms. hsiang asked her two sons which of them was going to look after her when she was old . but her sons tossed the question back and forth and finally nominated their rather bossy seven - year - old girl cousin !
" i knew they were only joking , but i could n't help feeling sad , and it made me even more aware that in everything you can only rely on yourself . anything else is phony ! " says hsiang .
having a husband and children , her mother and a lot of friends and relations , and with plenty to do , ms. hsiang is never alone , yet she can not help feeling lonely .
sometimes at night she ca n't sleep and gets up to mop the floor . for a time she even started playing tetris . " lying in bed , playing with complete concentration , not thinking about anything else , i got up to scores of tens of thousands of points ! " she says , finding this ridiculous even herself .
" whenever i notice i 'm getting down , i start looking for things to do , " she says .
middle age is a minefield , and you must n't fall into the trap of letting yourself get downhearted !
the best laid plans
apart from those to do with health , marriage and work , many other unexpected changes may occur in middle age .
when he was 38 , chao ning , who is now a director of the buddhist satellite tv station ltv and the producer of many buddhist tv programs , was invited to houston , texas to give a lecture . on the plane he happened to meet buddhist master hsingyun of foguangshan temple .
after 14 hours of the master earnestly speaking to him about the principles of buddhist life , " even a stone would have been moved ! " after chao 's lecture in houston was over , he immediately took a plane to los angeles and went to hsi lai temple , which was just being built .
there he sought out master hsingyun and declared his conversion to buddhism , and since then he has never touched a drop of alcohol .
" before that , i always had a rhyming couplet pasted up by my doorway which read : ' i know there is wine in this world , / but not that it can make you drunk , ' which was my way of bragging about my drinking prowess . "
what power caused him to make such a great change ?
chao ning himself ca n't explain . " in the us , 38 and 49 are special ages . i had come to realize many things , and when fate brought the right opportunity , i was ready for a change of heart , " says chao .
he converted to buddhism at 38 , got married at " 491?2 , " and before many years had become the " super-old dad " of three children . the changes in chao ning 's life in middle age can not be described as small .
" looking back , it seems that none of the road i took in life is what i expected . "
chao reveals that 40 years ago when he was taking his college entrance exams , he put down all kinds of choices of university but deliberately did not include ntnu , because he thought he was not interested in being a teacher .
but although he did not study at ntnu , he went to teach there , and has been there for over 20 years .
" every year i make a big palaver about wanting to plan my life and how i 'm going to give up teaching and concentrate on broadcasting . " chao continues with the same forthright , sincere smile : " but who 'd have thought that in the blink of an eye my colleagues would be telling me : ' old chao , you need n't bother planning , you 're soon going to retire ! ' "
although he never got around to planning his life , chao , who has always liked to " follow his feelings , " feels that every step he has taken has been steady and enriching . now that he is about to leave middle age for the age of wisdom , this causes him to walk on eagerly , with a spring in his step .
his only real worry is for his three children , now aged seven , five and two years old .
not daring to get old
" sometimes when i look at their lovely faces while they sleep , i feel i hav n't done right by them , because i 'm so much older than they are . "
the phrase most often on chao ning 's lips nowadays is , " because my kids are small , i ca n't get old just yet . " chao plays basketball three times a week , and is early to bed and early to rise . having become a father in middle age , he is doing his best to stay young for his children .
midlife changes may , as for chao ning , be one 's own choices and bring satisfaction . but there are so many changes which are not chosen and are impossible to prevent , and of these unemployment is one of the most fearsome . the economic malaise which has spread through taiwan in just the last two years is rapidly overtaking tens of thousands of middle - aged workers .
" a few days ago i heard about the death of a friend of mine . after he was forced to retire from taiwan machinery manufacturing corporation , he set up a stand selling grilled food at chichin bathing beach in kaohsiung .
but before long he died of a coronary . " simon chang , former managing director of the chunghwa telecom employees ' union , says that on hearing the news , many of the deceased man 's good friends could not help thinking : " if we 'd known he 'd die so young , we should n't have stopped him that time when he wanted to go after the boss of tmmc with a molotov cocktail ! "
chang , who worked at cht for over 10 years , says that next year the company plans to cut its workforce by a full 3,000 people , which means that within the next year 3,000 people will be " forced to retire . "
but the average age of cht 's workers is only 46 !
who will tell me ? !
forty - six - what an awkward age .
the majority of these workers are carrying the tremendous burden of being the breadwinner for three generations .
" the sense of uncertainty about employment has begun to affect every facet of life . " simon chang says that this is a cause of marital tension , and these workers have thousands of questions sticking in their throats , such as : will they have to interrupt their children 's education ? should they accept a transfer , and move the whole family somewhere else ? what kind of second skill should they learn to keep themselves employable ? how long a buffer period can the company give them ? but nobody is willing to give them a clear answer .
chang suggests that rather than the government spending vast amounts on unemployment benefits , it would be better for it to set up a life guidance and psychological counseling system for workers at all state - owned and private enterprises , as quickly as possible . " what we want is n't money , but clear guidance to the future ! "
" for a middle - aged person , losing one 's job is just as traumatic as a car accident , falling ill , the death of a spouse or a child running away from home . it 's an event beyond their control which suddenly turns their life upside - down . " chiu chia - li , director of the hwo chyuan pastoral counseling center , describes this kind of occurrence as a " non-normative event . " such events are much more traumatic than " normative events " such as job stress , a parent being paralyzed , children growing up and leaving home , or being passed over for promotion , all of which are more predictable .
looking around us , there are many middle - aged people who , although one can not say they are unemployed , do n't have a regular career .
in his youth , lin hung - kui of chungli in taoyuan county started up in business from nothing , selling shaved iced snacks .
he did well , and used his money to buy three or four shops and apartments .
in the end he gave up his shop because the work became physically too demanding , but after several failed attempts in other lines of business , today he can only live on his savings and the rent from his apartments .
he has enough to get by , but spending the whole day doing nothing he finds it difficult to face the inquiring glances of neighbors .
two years ago , encouraged by his wife , who works for an estate agency , lin went on a pre-work training course at the agency . being stuck in among a group of young kids in their twenties , and being subjected to " shock style " training - including listening to pep talks , singing military songs and shouting slogans at the tops of their voices - made lin feel very uncomfortable .
finally , after sticking it out for a month , he quit the job on receiving his first pay packet . " there are many things which young people can do without any inhibitions , but in middle age you build yourself all kinds of high walls which are very hard to escape from . " lin counts himself lucky , for he does n't need to break his back just to earn a pittance . but his mood is always uncertain .
in the last two years he has begun studying the book of changes and fengshui , in the hope that he can take his life to a higher level .
a second spring
" in the us , indecision and depression often drive middle - aged people , especially women , to return to college , to clarify their future path through further study . " hwo chyuan pastoral counseling center director chiu chia - li quotes her own experience . at one time she worked simultaneously as a clothing designer , a part - time community worker and a counselor .
coming from a poor background , she always worked hard to hold down these three jobs . but the more she saw of life , the more dissatisfied she felt with her own situation , and hoped she could make a new breakthrough .
although she had been cautious all her life , at the age of 42 she quit her jobs , and with a sense of release tinged with trepidation , went to study overseas . after leaving taiwan , chiu found a school in new york where most of the students were about her age . like her , many had come there because they had arrived at a point where they did not know what to do with their lives .
they had not come to earn a degree , but simply , through the process of study , to " sort out their lives bit by bit . " after five years in new york , chiu felt she had developed a great deal , and had enough strength to help people who needed help .
so she returned to taiwan to become a full - time counselor . " when i felt that i had reached a crisis , i did n't run away from it , but made the crisis into a challenge and faced it with courage . "
looking back on this phase of her life , chiu can not suppress a smile .
" i would n't call it success , and it does n't mean i do n't have any struggles left in my life .
but i know i 've had at least one experience of winning a battle with myself , so i can walk my future path more firmly . " everyone 's story of middle age is different ; the joys and sorrows of middle age mean different things to different people .

ancient giants of the forest - taiwan 's false cypresses
-lrb- chang chin - ju / photos by lai chun - piao / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
the bible says : " if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ' move hence to yonder place , ' and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you . "
for small as the mustard seed is , it grows into a mighty , spreading tree .
applying these words to taiwan , they most aptly describe the taiwan red cypress , whose tiny seeds are the origin of taiwan 's greatest trees . from conelets three millimeters in diameter come seeds no larger than sesame seeds , yet they grow into huge trees up to 60 meters tall .
the taiwan red cypress witnessed taiwan 's birth , squeezed up by the collision of two tectonic plates , and its progress from a fragile mass of broken rock to a more stable geology . it has also witnessed the rise and fall of taiwan 's forestry industry .
hsiuluan village , an atayal community in eastern hsinchu county , was one of the last places in taiwan to be reached by modern civilization , and was once famous as the " village without lights . "
in the mountain forest above hsiuluan 's outlying hamlet of chenhsipao , bushes and creepers form a dense undergrowth , and a blanket of damp fallen leaves makes the going slippery underfoot .
every ten to 20 meters , a magnificent taiwan red cypress , thousands of years old and with a trunk three to four meters thick , towers 40 meters into the sky . awe - stricken hikers standing below these great trees have the impression of having fallen into a sea of jungle , from which they can barely see the sky .
this remnant of virgin cypress forest runs northward to taoyuan county 's mt. lala and to chilan in ilan county . this great wall of trees acts as a vital " safety valve , " regulating the flow of water into the shihmen reservoir , the tanshui river and the lanyang river , on which millions of people in northern taiwan depend for the water they drink . the coat of green which clothes the mountains intimately affects water quality and soil stability in taoyuan , hsinchu , miaoli and ilan counties .
a land of clouds and mists
taiwan 's " false cypresses " - trees of the genus chamaecyparis , a subdivision of the cypress family , cupressaceae - are relics of the ice ages which brought them to our geologically young island .
thirty million years ago , chamaecyparis species were distributed all over the world . but after the ice ages , the high mountains of taiwan , which were squeezed up from the edges of two tectonic plates a million years ago , became their refuge .
today , only six false cypress species remain anywhere in the world , scattered far apart in north america , japan and taiwan .
two of them are native to taiwan : the taiwan red cypress -lrb- chamaecyparis formosensis , a.k.a. the formosan cypress -rrb- and the taiwan yellow cypress -lrb- chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana , a variety of hinoki cypress -rrb- .
the home of taiwan 's false cypresses is at medium elevations from 1,300 to 2,600 meters , which is taiwan 's area of greatest precipitation and a major source of water for over 100 rivers .
at these elevations there is much rainfall but relatively little wind , and the mountains are shrouded in clouds and mists all year round ; hence the forests there are also known as cloud forests . in this environment of constant humidity , the taiwan red cypress grew into east asia 's biggest conifer , with average heights from 30 to 40 meters . the cypress forests also mark the transition between taiwan 's broadleaved and coniferous forests .
false cypresses make up more than 70 % of the trees in this zone , but they are accompanied by a rich variety of other plants , including other big trees like formosan taiwania -lrb- taiwania cryptomerioides -rrb- , formosan cunninghamia -lrb- cunninghamia konishii -rrb- and chinese yew -lrb- taxus mairei -rrb- .
hidden in the dark , damp understorey are a third of taiwan 's fern species , and the millennia - old false cypresses are also a paradise for epiphytic plants - as many as 80 species have been found growing on a single tree .
taiwan 's earth god
the devastating 21 september earthquake of 1999 left taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . in mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .
professor chen yu - feng of providence university , who has been studying taiwan 's flora for many years , explains that false cypress forests often grew where river erosion created large areas of debris from rockslides .
as tectonic forces pushed taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . there they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . at the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming . " the growth of the cypress forests stabilized the rubble brought down by the rushing mountain rivers . the false cypresses are living ' spirits ' which naturally restore the land , " says chen yu - feng .
for the past million years , clouds rolling in on northeasterly monsoon fronts in winter and southwesterly airflows in summer have carried their moisture into the mountain valleys , to slowly condense onto the slopes where the false cypresses grow .
steeped in this dampness , the flora and fauna of the forest continued an unending cycle of growth and renewal through the changing seasons .
the only humans who entered there were the aboriginal people who came to hunt and to collect wild fruit and berries . every few decades the shaking of the earth would ravage this ecosystem , but protected by the vitality of the cypresses the land would gradually recover .
the nemesis of the cypress trees
however , the advent of mechanization , coupled with human greed , heralded a period of rapacious exploitation . in the 19th century human beings swarmed into taiwan 's dark mountains like busy worker ants .
the false cypresses , which had conversed with the clouds for a million years , were identified as top - grade timber , and were thus condemned to an inexorable fate .
after taiwan was ceded to japan following the sino - japanese war of 1894 , while the japanese were still quelling resistance to their rule they also went into the island 's mountains to collect botanical specimens .
in 1896 , a japanese biologist collected the first specimen of taiwan red cypress on yushan , and before long the taiwan yellow cypress was found there too .
in 1899 , the great cypress forests of mt. ali were discovered , and in 1912 , the japanese colonial government began large - scale logging there . everywhere the alishan mountain railway passes at higher elevations was once cypress forest . soon afterwards the forests of mt. taiping in modern ilan county and mt. pahsien in nantou were also opened up for logging . endless streams of cypress logs flowed out of the mountains , and were carried across the sea to japan to become pillars for shinto shrines .
quite apart from the incomparable quality of their timber , in terms of numbers alone the taiwan red and yellow cypress took second and third place among taiwan 's trees , so they became long - term cash cows for the island 's forestry industry .
after taiwan 's return to chinese rule , from the 1950s to the 1980s the roc used forestry income to support its industrial development . the logging grounds advanced deep into taiwan 's heart , consuming even greater areas than under the japanese .
false cypresses accounted for two - thirds of the 300,000 hectares of commercial forest , and contributed 70 - 80 % of forestry income .
all of taiwan 's forest recreation areas today are to be found in the former cypress logging grounds . the alishan mountain railway , and the long forestry roads which wind through taiwan 's four major mountain ranges , were all built for the sole purpose of shifting the huge cypress logs down the slopes . " you could say that everything connected with taiwan 's forestry industry developed around the false cypresses , " says forest ecologist yang kuo - chen , an associate professor at providence university . the history of forestry in taiwan is a history of false cypress felling , says yang .
hinoki and merihi
if you speak of " hinoki , " the japanese name of the taiwan yellow cypress , older taiwanese will lift their noses as if catching a whiff of its unmistakable fragrance - it has a firm place in their memories as the best of timbers .
the taiwan yellow and red cypress each have their own different qualities . the taiwan yellow cypress grows pencil - straight towards the heavens , and has a higher content of oil , from which a fragrant essence can be refined .
in 1971 , after the shinto gate at the meiji shrine in tokyo was struck by lightning , the japanese authorities especially came to taiwan to buy 11 huge , straight taiwan yellow cypress logs 16 to 24 meters long , cut from trees over 1,500 years old , to create the world 's biggest shinto gate .
as for the taiwan red cypress - merihi in japanese - it is even more magnificent in appearance than the taiwan yellow cypress . but the taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees . the crown is also broad and difficult to cut . this is why the gigantic ancient trees that have escaped the loggers ' chainsaws , such as those at mt. ali and mt. lala , are all taiwan red cypress .
human life is fleeting , but cypress is forever .
as the forestry industry gradually declined , the forestry huts built in the central range in the japanese period fell into disrepair , but their cypress - wood washbasins are still as good as new . the close grain of their growth rings reveals their age , and their resilience .
in the early days , the sleepers used for the alishan mountain railway were cut from broadleaved trees such as beech and michelia compressa . but tough as these woods are , the sleepers only stood up to three to five years of logging trains rumbling over them , so there was no choice but to change them all for sleepers made of false cypress wood , which lasted for decades .
and when the railways were finally taken out of service , the taiwan forestry bureau -lrb- tfb -rrb- sold off the old sleepers , and from the proceeds not only was able to recoup the cost of dismantling the railways , but was also left with a tidy sum for its own coffers .
for the older generation , the excellence of false cypress wood is hard to put into words . old folk to this day still rattle on about how the cypress - wood sleeping platforms of japanese - style houses were long - lasting and hard - wearing , and how the best bathtubs were of course those of made of false cypress wood .
in the eyes of furniture makers , " false cypress wood is light and easy to work ; it is flexible , rotproof and termite resistant .
it rarely warps , and hardly shrinks ; it planes to a smooth , fine surface .
it 's so versatile : boats , bridges , carriages , cabinets or coffins - there 's not one it 's not suitable for . "
in short , of all taiwan 's commercial timbers , there 's not another to match it .
pining away however , behind these sweet memories of cypress wood are the regrets of the foresters .
surveys made before logging began at mt. ali , taiwan 's earliest cypress logging area , showed that there were more than 300,000 false cypresses over 1,000 years old , but today all that remains of them is a few lonely - looking old trees scattered among introduced japanese red cedar -lrb- cryptomeria japonica -rrb- and flowering cherries .
despite its great fame , deprived of the company of its own species the most celebrated of the giant taiwan red cypresses of mt. ali finally succumbed to lightning and fire .
the tfb once hoped that if a few false cypresses were left standing in each of the old logging areas , they would seed naturally . but they discovered that although the trees were completely uninjured , they died one by one .
late taiwanese forestry expert liu chin described these few remaining trees as " dying of loneliness . " it seems that when abandoned by the companions they had relied on for millennia , and left to face the rigors of their environment alone , these ancient survivors went into terminal decline .
but an even greater cause for regret is that " 50 years of intensive false cypress logging tore the heart out of taiwan 's life - support system . this devastation , coupled with agriculture moving up into the mountains , can only result in landslides , floods and all kinds of ' natural ' disasters . . . . " with ecologists ' warnings ringing in their ears , now that floods and mudslides have become a common occurrence , people can only nod in tacit agreement . large - scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 .
with forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the executive yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect taiwan 's land . but the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of taiwan had already been breached .
apart from some scattered local stands , the taiwan red cypress forest of mt. hsiukulan in central taiwan , and the 10,000 - plus hectares of taiwan yellow cypress at mt. chilan in ilan county in northern taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .
whose national park ?
humans cut down the million year - old cypress forests in less than a century , but the story of their destruction is not over .
amazingly , the ban on logging natural forests has not protected chilan , the only single - species forest of hinoki cypress surviving in the world today .
before the ban , the vocational assistance commission for retired servicemen -lrb- vacrs -rrb- , which manages chilan , had already cut down almost 6,000 hectares . to generate income , vacrs has continued logging there under the pretext of " clearing away dead and fallen trees to make space for young trees to grow . " ecologists and biologists can only repeat again :
" the trees have been growing by themselves for tens of thousands of years , so why would they need human help for their saplings to grow ? " in response to this situation a popular movement sprang up to push for the establishment of a " cypress forest national park , " in the hope that with national park status , the last remaining virgin taiwan yellow cypress forest could be saved .
perhaps the millennium year was a decisive one for the trees , for the executive yuan allocated new funds to the vacrs so that it no longer needs to cut down trees to bolster its finances , and also approved a plan to set up a national park . but so - called ecotourism is now emerging as another threat to the trees ' survival .
to assure the livelihood of the local atayal aborigines of chilan , when the cypress national park is set up consideration will have to be given to how to balance the need to protect the forests with the demand for sustainable tourism .
how can taiwan 's false cypresses become more than just a tool of human economic activity ? can the sad history of cypress logging teach the people of taiwan a lesson in how to truly care for their land ? perhaps these questions are still more important than the issue of establishing a national park .
a future for the cypresses ?
at the atayal village of chenhsipao in hsinchu county , by three in the afternoon the clouds rolling in from afar have quietly slipped over the ridges and covered the whole mountainside where the cypress trees grow .
here , in taiwan 's remote but vitally important heartland , gigantic trees which have survived the long river of time and escaped the ravages of logging stand undaunted , like guardian spirits quietly protecting the atayal people and taiwan 's land .
only if we can allow the cypress trees a future , will the people of taiwan also have a lasting future . p. 31
the virgin taiwan yellow cypress forest of chilan dwarfs human visitors .
can today 's generation of taiwanese save our island 's last remaining forest of these giant trees , for themselves and later generations ? p. 33
on the pretext of clearing dead wood , many live taiwan yellow cypresses have been felled in the forest of chilan .
p. 33 the seeds hidden in the tiny conelets of the taiwan red cypress seem blessed with a mysterious power . in the harshest of natural environments , they grow into mighty , towering trees .

this taiwan red cypress planted by the japanese at mt. ali in 1915 has now reached a girth of 70 centimeters . but the smallest commercial size of taiwan red cypress is 150 centimeters . this means that artificially planted trees are not ready for harvest until they are 300 years old .
hence since the false cypress forests were cleared , taiwanese - preferring quick profits - have generally planted japanese red cedar , which is ready to be felled after only 20 years .
new - found fame : three cyber-authors dealing with success
-lrb- eric lin / photo courtesy of red ink publishing / tr. by christopher macdonald -rrb-
cyber-literature has become a publishing phenomenon , with teenage readers idolizing its star authors : writers such as tsai chih - heng - who set the ball rolling with his first cyber-novel and is known online as " slicker tsai " - along with chi chi , and shuang - tzu .
how do these authors , whose literary apprenticeship has differed so much from that of other , more traditional authors , view the business of writing ?
" dunno , " is what cyber-authors mostly reply when asked why their works have generated so much interest both in cyberspace and in the conventional publishing trade .
tsai chih - heng , whose online work the first intimate contact became a bookstore bestseller , elaborates a little : " it 's probably just the luck of the draw . "
tsai released the first intimate contact on the web in 1998 , while reading for his doctorate at national cheng kung university 's department of hydraulics and ocean engineering .
he began by posting the story - based on his own love - life - in installments on a bbs , as a distraction from the pressure of writing his thesis . " the first intimate contact was my first novel , " says tsai .
" i had posted a few smaller pieces on the web before , in a similar vein , but with my scientific background i never considered myself literary material . all i was trying to do was write down my own story in novel form . " tsai 's approach is to write about personal experience , with a touch of imagination thrown in . " at first i had no intention of finishing the thing , " says tsai candidly .
" but after a few installments the readers wanted more , and there was pressure to continue . eventually i put aside my doctoral thesis for a month or so and drilled off the rest of the novel . " tsai acknowledges that because of the immediacy of the medium his online work is to some degree influenced , in terms of form , content and progress , by the response of the readers - " even if a lot of that influence is unconscious . " the author of sunny doll , chi chi , has a similar experience .
" sunny doll was surprisingly popular after just a few postings , and the enthusiastic response from readers made me anxious to finish the story as soon as possible .
this probably explains the rather slapdash ending , " says chi chi . of course there are also those like shuang - tzu , author of worn - out socks , who remain unfazed by readers ' reactions .
in shuang - tzu 's case , this reflects her experience as the administrator of a bbs site . " the administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so i learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says shuang - tzu .
as she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing . " it took only a month and a half to write worn - out socks , but before that i spent a year and a half on another novel , departed soul , " says shuang - tzu . for her , the biggest source of pressure as a writer is the obligation to " finish . " in order to reduce this pressure she starts with a disclaimer : " do n't ask me how it 's progressing .
if you do n't see any more installments then maybe there wo n't be any more . " most cyber-authors are used to writing directly online , which inevitably makes for some clunky sentences and continuity breaks .
revisions are always needed before online works can be turned into real books , but the writers are still happy writing the way they do at present .
" i wo n't change the way i release my work , " says chi chi , " because it was the web environment that got me writing in the first place . " tsai chih - heng and shuang - tzu feel the same way .
so far , the critical reception for cyber-literature in book form has not been great , as tsai chih - heng and chi chi both bear in mind .
says tsai : " the success is just a matter of good luck . i 'll still do what i originally wanted to do - teach at university - and i 'll write as much as i feel i need to . " on the other hand , shuang - tzu , who graduated in chinese literature from hua fan university , does have literary ambitions .
" i do n't want to categorize my own works , just so long as they are ' understandable . '
i 'm interested in writing bona fide literature , but writing is n't going to be my main profession because i know that economic pressures can get in the way of natural creativity . " in cyber-literature , casual writing , endless dialogue and wacky goings - on are the norm .
if someone writes it , someone else will read it . as to the literary merits of the form and whether it will determine the course for literature in the coming century , that 's not something that unduly concerns the cyber-authors .
as tsai chih - heng , chi - chi and shuang - tzu all agree , regardless of fame , they themselves are still free spirits in cyberspace .
a gao xingjian storm blows through the tibe -lrb- laura li / tr. scott williams -rrb-
the ninth taipei international book exhibition - the " first book exhibition of the millennium " - got underway this year in the comfortable afterglow of the lunar new year 's holiday .
highlighting this year 's show was a visit by nobel - prize - winning author gao xingjian from his adopted country , france .
according to gao , taiwan feels almost like home . moreover , his affinity for taiwan and its affection for him left a good impression at this year 's tibe .
gao 's old friend lung ying - tai , director of the taipei bureau of cultural affairs , nonetheless thanked him for his visit and for re-igniting taiwan 's passion for literature .
gao xingjian , the first chinese nobel laureate for literature , created quite a stir with his visit to the ninth taipei international book exhibition -lrb- tibe -rrb- , drawing large crowds of people hoping just to catch a glimpse of him .
gao 's relationship with taiwan goes back a number of years , and this visit to the tibe marked his sixth to the island , where he is well known and has many friends in the literary community . a bible in hand
taiwan 's united daily news publishing spotted gao 's talent long before he became famous , publishing five of his novels - including soul mountain and one man 's bible .
in addition , the famed director li hsing 's tienti publishing has published a collection of gao 's plays .
and at this year 's tibe , gao released three new works to hungry taiwanese readers : a collection of 100 ink paintings and pieces of art criticism ; a play ; and a collection entitled without isms . in the past , gao 's works of fiction have not sold particularly well , perhaps because some find them to be cold or to resemble to long , mumbling soliloquies . at this year 's tibe , however , the glow of gao 's nobel prize sparked interest in his work .
over the exhibition 's six days , readers purchased between five and six thousand volumes of his soul mountain , making it one of the exhibition 's top three sellers -lrb- along with former japanese porn star iijima ai 's platonic sex and the latest harry potter book -rrb- .
whether taiwanese readers were just putting on airs or actually enjoyed the book , if the gao frenzy reinvigorates taiwanese interest in pure literature , it will have done a world of good .
gao 's own artistic life extends beyond fiction to painting and theater . over the past few years he has held two taiwanese exhibitions of his modern ink paintings , and a third is planned for october at the national museum of history .
in addition , a special reading of gao 's the night walker was given at the novel hall in taipei , during this visit of his . and gao himself will direct a performance of his august snow at the end of the year . the refined language of literature
having a chance to see gao in person , tibe visitors naturally focused on his artistic vision and creative process .
in a speech presented at the exhibition , gao stated that over the course of decades of writing , he has given ever - greater attention to the heart of literature - the art of language .
to gao , the only standard for judging literature is the beauty of its language , and language itself is a means of getting at " reality . "
gao refers to his own approach to writing as " stream - of - language " and believes that writers who seek a vivid , modern chinese face an extremely difficult path .
gao also revealed that to ensure that his own writing remains fresh and lively , he first speaks his thoughts into a recorder before later recasting them in a written form .
gao xingjian feels that writing is an extremely personal pursuit , that its starting point is a quest for personal values .
if a writer is to produce good work , he must cast aside political and social missions , disregard the opinions of readers and the market , and instead must write spontaneously , listening carefully to the faintest , most honest voice in his heart .
considering that gao fled a tyrannical government to become an expatriate , many people wonder whether gao 's literature insists upon humanitarianism and high principles .
but gao feels that literature is above politics and should not serve it . further , literature should not be limited by morals , ethics or public sentiment .
in gao 's view , 20th century literature too often emphasized " literary revolution " or was " revolutionary literature . " it was too often tied to a preposterous sense of mission which took literature with it to the grave .
as gao said at the nobel prize awards ceremony , communist rule stymied the development of mainland chinese literature .
not surprisingly , the chinese communists were critical of the selection of gao as a nobel laureate , labeling his choice an " imperialist conspiracy " and another " insult to all chinese " by the west .
this standoff between the nobel laureate and his cultural motherland adds a note of regret to the joy of chinese people around the world . soul mountain and the flesh
given that gao wrote his works in chinese , his translator played a major role in his winning of the nobel prize .
goran malmqvist , a member of the swedish royal academy and gao 's strongest advocate for the nobel prize , and noel and liliane dutrait , the french translators of soul mountain and other works by gao , also attended this year 's tibe .
to reflect the growing internationalization of chinese literature , this year 's tibe even included a taiwanese literature in translation pavilion . the pavilion hosted a number of seminars and colloquia on literary translation , providing readers with some insight into a field with which most are unfamiliar .
gao has touched off another interesting debate in taiwan - one on the competing desires of the spirit and the flesh . discussing gao together with former japanese porn star iijima ai causes many cultural critics to shake their heads , but the two writers ' works are not that dissimilar .
while soul mountain describes one man 's spiritual journey , it also contains numerous graphic descriptions of sexual desire . similarly , ai 's book on the flesh actually expresses her longing for spiritual love . these two works remind us that the spirit and the flesh are both aspects of being human and that the distance between these two " opposing desires " is not as great as most people seem to think .
while gao xingjian is the first nobel laureate in literature to have attended the tibe , this year 's exhibition included a number of other highlights .
with 46 nations and 886 publishing companies represented , tibe is the largest book show in asia and the fourth largest in the world .
this year 's tibe was also made special by having france as its country of honor . guests thus included andrei makine , the russian - born french author of le testament francais and winner of france 's prestigious goncourt prize ; novelist marc levy ; and the cartoonist golo . in addition , numerous representatives from france edition and librairie le pigeonnier were involved with the exhibition from start to finish , contributing greatly to its success .
the book publishing development association of the roc , which sponsored the tibe this year , noted that it chose france as the country of honor in response to the americanization of global culture . the association stated that it hoped the choice of france would give taiwan 's readers a glimpse of european culture , offering them exposure to an alternative perspective and system of thought .
of course , the fact that gao is now a french citizen and happened to win the nobel prize for literature just two months before the show did n't hurt either .

nuclear - free dream recedes amid inter-branch conflict
-lrb- alexandra liu / tr. by robert taylor -rrb-
having dragged on since 27 october last year , the furore over the cancellation of the fourth nuclear power plant project was briefly laid to rest on 13 february 2001 , when premier chang chun - hsiung and legislative yuan speaker wang jin - pyng signed an agreement to resume construction of the plant .
however , the controversy over the plant was soon put back in the spotlight by calls for a plebiscite on the issue . on one side of the argument is the unquenchable thirst for economic advance ; on the other , the long - term ideal of a nuclear - free homeland , and the distress of the people of kungliao , where the plant is sited .
standing at the nuclear crossroads , buffeted by the waves of political turmoil sparked by the project , how should taiwan choose its road for the future ?
on 14 february , in a statement in which he spoke of a " painful choice " and his " undying determination , " premier chang chun - hsiung announced the resumption of work on the fourth nuclear power plant , and identified the passing of a plebiscite law as the most important topic for renewed cross-party consultation . he also responded positively to the legislative yuan 's indication of its support for the goal of a " nuclear - free homeland . "
with the words : " developments over the coming ten months will decide taiwan 's fate for the next 10,000 years , " chang hinted that the next stage in the antinuclear campaign will be a decisive factor in the legislative yuan elections scheduled for the end of the year .
the same day , the cabinet approved the plan to resume construction of the fourth nuclear power plant , and announced that it would formulate a plan for the phased closure and decommissioning of the three existing nuclear plants , on condition that adequate electricity generating capacity is maintained .
the executive yuan would invite a wide range of environmentalist groups and individuals to join a " nuclear - free homeland guidance committee " to actively educate the public .
at the cabinet meeting , economic affairs minister lin hsin - yi stressed that the fourth nuclear power plant project would be completed on time in july 2005 .
after the decision to resume work on the plant , legislator chao yung - ching said he had never seen another example of a government which on the one hand stressed its desire for a " nuclear - free homeland , " but on the other still finally went ahead with building a nuclear power plant .
on 24 february the nuclear - free country action alliance , a coalition of over 100 antinuclear groups , staged a demonstration to call for a plebiscite on the project , to " let the people decide . "
leading democratic progressive party figures such as former party chairmen lin i - hsiung and yao chia - wen , and former secretary - general chang chun - hung , took part in the rally .
the saga of the fourth nuclear power plant began in 1980 , when taipower first proposed the project .
but following the worldwide shock at the 1986 chernobyl explosion , the legislative yuan froze the project 's budget .
since the yenliao anti-nuclear self - help association was set up in 1988 , it and other groups have also fought a running battle with the government over the plant .
the control yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . these instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project . energy policy suggestions kmt chairman lien chan proposed to president chen shui - bian the drafting of a " national energy development statute , " based on considerations of national energy supply and demand .
in view of projections that in 2005 northern taiwan will have a shortfall of close to 2,100 megawatts , construction of the fourth nuclear power plant should continue , but no further nuclear plants would be built , and the first , second and third plants would be decommissioned on reaching the end of their normal operating lives .
but before that the 11 private power stations already approved for construction should be completed as quickly as possible , and if 2,000 megawatts of substitute generating capacity could be completed , the three older nuclear plants could be decommissioned early . lien also expressed the opinion that when formulating its overall energy policy , the new government should give consideration to various factors , including environmental impact and taiwan 's international reputation .
however , with the resumption of work on the fourth nuclear power plant , the people of kungliao rural township have nothing to show for more than a decade of protest .
not only do they feel that they have never had an opportunity for equal dialogue with the government , but also that the fishing grounds on which local fishermen have relied for generations will soon be threatened with major environmental degradation .
according to the research report a survey of the natural and ecological resources of the northeast coast national scenic area by cheng ming - hsiu , an associate research fellow at the academia sinica 's institute of zoology , species recorded in the sea off the scenic area include 182 corals , 168 crustaceans , 318 mollusks , 57 echinoderms , 60 large seaweeds , over 290 shellfish and more than 100 other marine organisms such as sponges , sea anemones , jellyfish , polychaetes and sea squirts . this shows that yenliao bay really is one of northern taiwan 's major marine habitats , and is also one of the places in northern taiwan where a coastal ecosystem has been preserved relatively undamaged .
ecological disaster after work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation .
but environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three - kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from yenliao to fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .
following the amorgos oil spill , we saw the public and the military working hard to scoop up bucket after bucket of oil .
but what should our mood be when it comes to the fourth nuclear power plant 's impact on the sea off kungliao ? chen po - chih , chairman of the council for economic planning and development , is one of the cabinet ministers who take the clearest stand against nuclear power .
he stated on 14 february that he once made a risk assessment for nuclear power in taiwan , taking into consideration the island 's population density , its level of nuclear technology and its level of economic development , and concluded that it was not worth the risk . but since it would appear from public opinion polls that the majority in taiwan believe that for economic reasons the plant should still be built , he could only hope that construction standards will be strictly adhered to , and that no accident will ever occur at the plant .
government , opposition and the public at large , apart from closely monitoring the plant 's construction , can only pray together with chen that the people 's choice today will turn out for the good of their children and grandchildren .

taiwan toils with double trouble -- forest fires burn and oil spill bubbles -lrb- chang chin - ju / tr. by david mayer -rrb- with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out over the fourth nuclear power plant , a cargo ship ran quietly aground in mid-january just offshore from the lungkeng ecological protection area in kenting national park .
preliminary containment of the resulting oil spill was not achieved until late february . in the meantime , taiwan has been hit by a rash of forest fires . clearly , the activities of man are becoming increasingly destructive of nature . can we expect to go on forever wreaking havoc on the earth without inviting a backlash from mother nature ?
the armed forces dispatched thousands of soldiers to deal with the oil spill at lungkeng , located at the southern tip of taiwan , and the first phase of the cleanup was completed on february 16 with the removal of over 300 tons of oil from the shore .
the second phase entails cleaning the uplifted coral seashore and restoring the environment of the intertidal zone . the problem is that efforts to clean up the oil could cause great damage to the complex ecology of the coral shoreline and destroy the beauty of the intertidal zone .
how to go about undoing the environmental destruction that has already occurred ? due to a lack of comprehensive studies , the local environment in lungkeng is not sufficiently understood .
with scholars still in the midst of research , it has been impossible to take concrete action .
the oil spill occurred at about 5 p.m. on january 14 when the greek freighter mv amorgos carrying ore from india to the port of nantong in mainland china ran aground about a kilometer off the cape at oluanpi . a thousand tons of fuel oil began pouring through the ship 's torn hull . the disaster has hit the uplifted coral at lungkeng the hardest . the ocean waves brought the oil to shore , making a mess of the beautiful coral coastline , slathering shellfish and aquatic plants , and filling the air with a petroleum stench .
taiwanese society , caught up in the furor over the nuclear power plant up north , took little immediate notice of the accident . the shipowner did n't stop up the leaking hull of the mv amorgos until the end of january .
he went through a shipping agent in taiwan to hire local residents in lungkeng to clean up the shoreline , but the oil slick had mucked up a three - kilometer stretch of strikingly beautiful blue waters , throwing a pall over the local tourism and fishing industries .
after days of bitter complaints , aggrieved residents finally got the attention of the news media .
on february 7 , three weeks after the spill , the environmental protection administration formed an emergency task force , and epa chief edgar lin headed south to inspect the site .
on february 10 , premier chang chun - hsiung and several other high - ranking government officials boarded a military helicopter for an aerial survey of the spill , and the premier instructed the ministry of transportation and communications and the ministry of national defense to get the oil cleaned up within 30 working days .
the epa worked up an estimate of the cost of cleanup , ship removal , and reparations to fishermen , and notified both the shipowner and the insurance company .
the ship 's captain and other ship officers had to post bond before they were allowed to leave taiwan . in addition to these emergency measures , the epa has also been working to draft : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a set of guidelines for establishing task forces to deal with major maritime environmental disasters ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- an emergency response plan for maritime oil spills . draft versions of both these documents will be presented to the cabinet as soon as possible . the cabinet will request the legislative yuan to authorize an extraordinary budget allocation to cover the purchase of oil containment booms , sorbents , helicopters , and other equipment needed for responding to oil spills .
the problem , however , is that authorities did not respond in the critical first few hours and days following the spill . this failure focused renewed attention on poor coordination between the central and local governments . in a public opinion poll , nearly 70 % of respondents indicated dissatisfaction with the government 's handling of the oil spill .
with today 's huge volume of international shipping , oil spills are becoming a serious problem .
although the recent spill in taiwan was small in comparison with 10,000 - ton spills that have occurred elsewhere , the situation here is worrisome because , as a petroleum importer , oil tankers ply the waters around our island in swarms . there is no telling when the next spill might happen . while acknowledging the necessity of drafting emergency response plans , academics argue that an even more pressing task facing the government is to catalog taiwan 's marine resources .
otherwise , they say , it may be impossible to press reparation claims against shipping companies that accurately reflect the extent of damages . the lack of a detailed understanding of the lungkeng ecology presents a perfect case in point .
similarly , after the recent spate of forest fires in central and southern taiwan , scholars have again reacted by calling on the government to begin as soon as possible with ongoing studies of taiwan 's forest habitats .
investigations have shown that most of the recent forest fires plaguing taiwan have been caused by campfires . although the recent fires have been put out fairly quickly , a blaze on snow mountain caused alarm when it burned near a stand of rare chinese hemlock as well as streams that are home to the formosan landlocked salmon , which is regarded as a national treasure .
forestry service officials indicate that none of the recent blazes has caused major damage , but the council of agriculture has instructed the various forestry districts to step up patrols to keep man - made forest fires from happening again and again .
chao jung - tai , a researcher at taiwan forestry research institute , feels that the public ought to take the forest fires and the oil spill in lungkeng as warnings of the urgent need to understand the environment in which we live .
for example , chao asks : what are the scientific criteria for deciding when a forest fire has caused enough damage to require rehabilitation of the environment afterwards ? under what circumstances is it okay to let the environment recover on its own ? these questions require ongoing monitoring and research before objective criteria can be developed and environmental rehabilitation efforts can be carried out properly .
once an environment that has taken shape over millions of years is destroyed , it is usually beyond man 's ability to undo the damage . efforts to that end often prove fruitless .
it is time to start devoting serious thought to the question of how to preserve the beauty of the island we call home .

" i can say my abcs ! " english instruction goes " prime " time
-lrb- teng sue - feng / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by sue jollow -rrb-
beginning in september , english will become a compulsory subject for primary school students in grades 5 and 6 .
in fact , choruses of " bo - po - mo " and " a - b - c " have been recited in primary school classrooms for a long time now .
many parents begin sending their children to " bilingual " kindergartens , or to private english schools long before , hoping to provide them with an english - speaking environment from an early age to prepare them to compete in modern society . the whole world seems to be learning english . is taiwan getting on the bandwagon too late ?
and what kind of developments have taken place in english language teaching methodology , from private language schools to the education system itself ?
for students in grades 1 and 2 , school should finish at midday , but at chunghsing primary school in hsimen district , the grade 2 students are performing an abridged english language version of the play " cinderella . "
their teacher , shen , says the line " my prince charming ! " and the young girl playing the part of cinderella , repeats it after her word for word . then the young boy playing the prince replies " you are beautiful ! " their audience of classmates breaks into laughter . after this , the class plays ' teacher says . '
speaking in english the teacher tells the children to do various actions : stand up , sit down , touch your hair , touch your nose ... . anyone who gets the action wrong is out . in today 's english lesson , a grade 4 class at jen ai primary school is starting sentences with ' i can . '
the teacher explains the basic pattern then the class begins a game of charades . children mime movements at the front of the class : swimming , dancing , jumping , running etc , and their classmates have to use english to describe what they 're doing . next is story telling time ; today 's story is about a child who just ca n't stop sneezing . what is he so sensitive to ? is it dust ? a plant ?
perfume ? pepper ? the story finishes as the bell sounds to end the lesson . forty minutes have passed in the blink of an eye .
after 4 pm students wearing the uniforms of jen ai , tunhua , and chien an primary schools stream into a private english school in a lane off tunhua south road .
in one classroom seven or eight students look at phonetic symbols on the blackboard and repeat the words after their teacher in a loud chorus , learning the relationship between the phonetic symbols and the letters .
putting down roots
just how widespread is this english learning among our primary students ?
mr. chen lives in neihu . four years earlier his daughter , now in grade 3 , attended english classes at a well known private kindergarten in neihu . every evening just on dusk the kindergarten 's minibus would pick up his daughter and take her away to spend two happy hours each day in a " totally american " language environment . " if your english is good , it gives you an edge .
it 's essential , " says chen . " i grew up in a rural area , and never had an environment like this . when i made my way into the wider world , i was on the back foot compared to people with good english . "
he wants his children to be better prepared for life than he was , so like the children of many of his friends and relatives , they began learning english in kindergarten . " as long as we can find the money , at least they wo n't be left behind at the starting line . "
even though the fees for his two children to attend a bilingual kindergarten came to nt$ 80,000 for just one term , chen considers it " money well spent . "
mrs. liu , a mother living on minsheng east road recalls some years ago , before english teaching in primary schools started in earnest . her daughter , then in grade 3 , started attending a private english school . she really enjoyed it and she found she was able to listen to english language educational programs on the radio all by herself .
" english is definitely an international language , and it 's become indispensable for getting by in the world - like being able to use a computer . you simply ca n't find work without it . "
these days learning english is part and parcel of a primary student 's life , unlike their parents who first met " a , b , c ... " when they began high school .
following on research done by chu hui - mei , head of the english department at the taipei municipal teachers college , in september , 1997 , taipei city selected 19 primary schools to pilot a grade 3 english program . together with schools not participating in this pilot program , by the end of 1997 there were already 112 primary schools in taipei city teaching english -lrb- 75 % of the total -rrb- .
that same year , kaohsiung city selected 77 primary schools to implement a comprehensive english language program for grades 5 and 6 , while in other areas , such as taipei county , ilan county and yunlin county , the bureau of education was giving more urgency to the promotion of english in primary schools .
english language teaching in primary schools is a key plank in a range of curriculum reforms to take us into the new century .
as early as 1996 , the educational reform committee of the executive yuan proposed that the ministry of education include english in the primary school curriculum . after taking office the former minister for education , wu ching , put forward the idea of a " nine - year integrated curriculum " encompassing primary and secondary education .
in 1998 , the president of the academia sinica , lee yuan - tseh , indicated to a meeting of the science and technology committee of the executive yuan that because english had been taught in taiwan as a " discipline " rather than as a " communication tool , " taiwanese who went to study overseas found they were unable to read what their professors had prescribed in the time available . morris chang , chairman of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation , echoed these sentiments , pointing out that compared with hong kong and singapore , the english competency of our high school and tertiary graduates is inadequate for any practical use . this is affecting taiwan 's access to information and acting as a barrier to increasing our productivity .
when he was premier , vincent siew agreed in principle to introducing english instruction in the earlier years of schooling .
situational abc
in actual fact , english for children was already popular all over taiwan even before these moves .
in 1997 associate professor chang hsien - ta of the national taiwan university linguistics research institute investigated whether or not a " second language " was being taught in public and privately run kindergartens in taipei city and county , and hsinchu city and county , and found that 79 % were doing so . in these kindergartens english was by far the most popular second language , being taught in 77.5 % . in taipei city the figure was 90 % .
in the current climate of almost unanimous community support for the expansion of english teaching into early education , the primary schools of taipei city with its rich resources , were the first to pilot this , but the investment of the parents has also been crucial .
huang yuan - tai , an administrator at chunghsing primary school gives an example : four years ago a parent who had worked in america approached the school , saying that at home they often told their children stories in english , and they wanted the other children to enjoy similar benefits . the school responded positively and for the next two years , gathered students in the middle and elementary grades together in a large group in the school hall each morning in their study hour , and conducted a program .
two years ago , realizing that the local parents had to work in the daytime , the school began holding supplementary after - school classes offering english lessons every wednesday afternoon for the elementary grades . " the parents are delighted . they think it 's far better for their children to be here improving their english than sitting at home in front of a tv . "
the current model is very different to how english used to be taught in secondary schools , which was " first learn to read and write , then learn to speak . "
english lessons for children emphasize situations , fun , and practice . " we 're basically creating the same environment for our children as an american preschooler would have , " says shen hui - lien , a teacher at chunghsing primary school . on wednesday afternoons she speaks only english with the children . they must ask " may i go to the bathroom ? " to get her permission to leave the room when the need arises . " children in these earliest grades are soak up everything like a sponge . this is the ideal time to establish their listening comprehension and pronunciation . "
jen ai primary school has over 100 classes . eight years ago it was approached by a parent offering to come to the school to teach the students some english songs and tell some english stories . a few years ago , the school began allowing grades 1 to 6 to turn on the tv sets in their classrooms every morning between 8:00 and 8:15 , and watch simple english dialogue videos produced by their teachers . big classes , little practice
what strikes people as curious is , if their schools have had english classes for a long time now then why do so many students need to go to private language schools ?
chen chien - hao , another teacher at jen ai primary school , says that at least two - thirds of his more than 600 students are getting extra english lessons outside school .
" if they were n't doing this extra work , they 'd never be able to keep up after entering junior high school . " according to mrs. su , a mother living in tanshui , many junior high schools include english listening comprehension tests in the entrance examinations and if primary school students do n't improve their skills then they simply wo n't make the grade .
in her family the problem is that her son began learning english when he was four , and so when he went to primary school , the english lessons were just too simple for him . and you really need small class sizes for the training of listening comprehension , and this is another thing the schools can not provide .
so the only thing to do is keep on sending him to the private language school , where classes are more ideally sized . another mother , mrs. chang , who lives on chunghsiao east road , recalls what happened a year earlier when her son 's school began teaching english . from the very beginning the teacher only spoke english and her son suffered a lot of setbacks .
" he just could n't understand a thing his teacher was saying , and he asked if he could go to a private english school . " she could n't see any other choice and agreed to let him enroll at one nearby .
the taipei city government bureau of education invited experts to form a working team to visit primary schools and inspect their english instruction programs . it found that for the majority of teachers , the greatest difficulty is the vast range of english levels of the students in a single class .
some have been learning english since very young and find class too easy , and so when the lesson starts their enthusiasm evaporates . for other students meeting english for the first time , however , the lessons are hard going .
added to this is the perennial problem of class sizes being too large , and not enough english classes scheduled - only one or two a week .
it 's extremely difficult to correct pronunciation problems , or to achieve any educational goals at all , under these conditions . the parents have a number of concerns . if the teachers only speak english in class it will frighten children who have never learnt english before .
some teachers teach too quickly and some of their students ca n't keep up , so all parents can do is send their kids to private language schools . singing and jumping around are not really suitable for the senior grades , and parents hope that teachers will keep in mind the different needs of different age groups . parents and teachers both raised the idea of " ability streaming , " i.e. , different classes for different ability levels , to address the difficulties of large classes .
educators , however , have many reservations . chu hui - mei explains , " every chinese family is preoccupied with being able to get ahead in the world , but our past experience with ability - based class groupings has taught us some bitter lessons . " when students are grouped on the basis of ability , some parents get upset when their children are placed in a lower level group , which makes them lose face . it can also affect the children 's confidence . " we have large numbers of students .
people need to think about what resources the schools have , and whether they could help in some way . " she suggests that schools can organize english clubs for the more advanced students , and their teachers can provide them with interesting story books which are more demanding . this way , they 'll feel that the teacher is giving them some attention , and that their needs are also being catered for . " private language schools fill a need for small - group learning . " professor chang hsien - ta recommends that teachers use " co-operative learning " methods . for example , divide a large class into groups to discuss what they would buy with nt$ 100 . the more advanced students can lead the discussion , which gives them a sense of participation .
but this kind of activity may not succeed the first few times - it takes time to get used to group learning . with regard to the problems of having too few classes a week and learning very little english , the working group suggested that schools could take advantage of times such as early - morning study hour , cleaning time , and the lunch break to play tapes or practise speaking english , to give students more exposure to english .
fewer foreign teachers
in the past , english teaching placed too much emphasis on reading and writing , whereas now for most primary school students , " learning to understand and speak is foremost , reading and writing is secondary . " nevertheless many people have reservations about the pronunciation of the english teachers in our primary schools .
private language schools also seem aware of this , and many prominently advertise the fact that they employ foreign teachers . but do the foreign teachers really teach more effectively than our local teachers ? " many people put the root of the problems they had learning english down to not being able to speak . " chu hui - mei says that while there are differences it 's difficult to say whether foreign or local teachers are better .
native speakers of english " may not understand what it 's like for someone learning english as a foreign language and the kinds of problems they face . " chu hui - mei took part in the inspection visits to primary schools , and foung that local teachers understand the children 's way of thinking and have a much better grasp of the course .
foreign teachers ' strengths lie in dialogue and accurate pronunciation . besides , " we ca n't put the whole responsibility of english language teaching onto foreign teachers . "
several years ago when there was a shortage of english teachers in the primary schools , many schools employed foreign teachers on an hourly basis , or made staff sharing arrangements with private language schools .
but these were stopgap measures . the ministry of education has already drawn up a whole range of plans for teacher training . these include establishing english teaching departments at teacher training colleges and supplementary education courses at tertiary institutions , allowing graduates who intend to become english teachers in primary schools to obtain official teaching qualifications , and providing further training for qualified teachers who have never taught english , to equip them with appropriate language teaching skills and methods .
the primary school english train has already left the station . what can we look forward to ?
yutsai primary school in taipei county did a survey of how parents felt about the primary english teaching program . it found that 52 % thought that the goal was to stimulate the students ' interest in learning english , and 45 % thought it was to establish a solid grounding in english for the children while they were still young .
professor chang hsien - ta says that given the expansion of english teaching into the primary schools , we can not allow a great gap to open between what 's happening in the primary and the secondary schools .
primary schools include a lot of games and activities in their english teaching , and while this is very lively , if all it amounts to is a lot of jumping around and loud pronunciation practice , the children may get a quite incorrect idea of what english is all about . when the day comes that they go to high school , and they have to settle down and read an essay , they could well find that really boring .
" listening , speaking , reading and writing all have their place . none should be overemphasized at the expense of the others . " " the way children learn english now wo n't be the same as it was for us .
resources have improved tremendously , and how things are done has changed along with the environment . the younger the students , the more essential it is to pay very serious attention to course standards , " says chu hui - mei . the current educational mantra is " student centered learning , " and the teacher 's role is extremely important .
according to her understanding , more than 80 % of the primary school teachers in taipei city are outstanding .
" what we envisage as a reasonable target is for the children to learn to hear and understand - and be able to say - 200 words after two years . " she wants the children to understand how to use the words , to be willing to use them , and to use them whenever the opportunity arises . she also hopes that they will get a lot of pleasure from reading english storybooks .
" the primary english program is not a subject like mathematics or chinese . it 's something new and it 's still finding its place in the curriculum , " says chen chien - hao , from jen ai primary school . as he sees it , the children must not feel that learning english is putting them under a lot of pressure . if they can see a word and read it aloud , that 's fine .
they can leave memorizing word lists until they get to high school . children come into contact with english all the time . they can learn from the little english whiz on television , or read the children 's english language magazine ez talk . let 's hope they 'll feel completely at ease speaking english and enjoy the learning process .

pinglin , tea capital of taipei county
-lrb- lin i - hsien / photos by hsueh chi - kuang / tr. by sue jollow -rrb-
take a pinch of pouchong tea leaves , place them in a cup of boiling - hot water , and before the second hand on the clock has completed a revolution , you 'll be assailed by the delicate fragrance of the freshly made golden green brew .
it 's the same sweet fragrance that fills the air everywhere you go when you 're in pinglin . pinglin township is situated in rural southern taipei county . being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "
arriving there , you 're greeted by mountainsides of emerald green surrounding the town of pinglin , and winding through it the peishih river , its crystal waters so clear that you can see right to the bottom . the population is steady at about 6,000 - 7,000 . it seems just the way it was 20 - odd years ago , and gives the impression that in another 20 years time , it will still retain this way of life without the constant hankering for more .
what is it about pinglin , nestled on the outskirts of taipei , that makes it able to maintain an idyllic life free from the lure of material gain ? roll out the red tape in 1979 , the urban development law placed the pinglin area under controls pertaining to taipei 's water catchment areas , and since then it has been extremely difficult to cultivate pinglin 's agricultural land .
nor can more buildings be put up to cater to any increase in the population .
all that can be done are just very minimal repairs and renovations to the already existing housing stock , and this has caused a sharp decline in the value of land there .
under the myriad regulations , pinglin 's population has plummeted . although many want to return , they often shy away because of the difficulties life in pinglin would entail .
chen hsin - ping is a man in his early twenties who works at the ping lin tea museum . drinking some wine , he says , " here in pinglin we do n't have a single entertainment venue . really , not one . and all the regulations drive us crazy .
if you want to build a house or do some extension , there 'll be some person coming to investigate , and it 's always the same , you ca n't do this , and you ca n't do that . "
the many restrictions safeguard pinglin 's beautiful natural setting , but they exact a heavy toll from the local people .
luckily , pinglin produces fine tea to follow the alcohol in which they drown their cares .
a refined air
pinglin is an ideal location for tea cultivation , and many there had been doing it since way back , but after pinglin started winning first prizes in the provincial government 's tea competitions , the government began to pay serious attention to pinglin tea .
moreover , seeing the profitability of tea , almost all the local farmers began specializing in tea . the freshly picked tips of oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water .
whether sold domestically or exported , pinglin 's pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels . both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90 % of the people of pinglin , life revolves around tea .
when the spring and autumn tea harvests are on , the people in every household can barely snatch four hours sleep a night , because the whole sequence from picking the tea leaves and processing them into their final form , requires more than ten uninterrupted hours , at the least .
the fragrance of tea accompanies them to bed each night , and awaits them in the morning . the days go on in this fashion for a month or two . huang kuei - ying lives in rural pinglin . as a young girl she helped with the tea work , and later her husband also cultivated tea .
remembering the grueling heat of summer , she sighs , " women in pinglin have a really hard life .
they get barely a few hours sleep a night in tea - picking season , and they still have to look after their family and the housework . "
her neighbour , lin , laughs in agreement , " tea processing , it just kills you ! " the hsin ping tea emporium has won numerous awards in tea competitions . the proprietor , mr. chen , has been associated with tea since he was very young : " i never got very far in school , so the best thing is to keep on growing tea . "
when we turned to the secret of how to process good tea , mr. chen was spare with words . " you need focus , and experience . "
indeed , to pick tea you have to take into account the weather and then , after selecting just the right time to pick , you carry out a series of fermentation steps that vary depending on just what the leaves are like that day .
how long should the leaves ferment outdoors ? how long indoors ? these questions are decided by the grower , using everything at his disposal - eyes , nose , heart , mind , mouth , and hands , all working in harmony . a tiny bit more , a second less - it 's a discipline and an art .
following fermentation , step by step , the tips are withered and crumbled , any lumps are broken up , then the tips are fired .
each of these steps affects the quality of the finished product . the timing must be accurately calculated , the temperature must be precise . unfortunately , there are no standards to follow . absolutely everything relies on each grower 's store of personal experience .
tough times ahead for tea growers ?
the annual tea competition in pinglin is a chance for tea growers to talk shop . they examine and appraise the teas , note the aroma and the color of the steeped tea , and assess the good and bad points of every family 's tea . different grades will bring different prices on the market . award - winning teas often sell out . for better or worse , the tea growers ' reputations are made on such occasions .
according to mr. chen , the growers compare themselves with each other , discussing their processing methods . when someone does n't do as well as they had hoped in a tea competition , they try to figure out why their tea did n't match up with that of other growers .
" you need to constantly reflect , review and discuss your processing . that 's the only way to improve the quality . "
these days , about 80 % of the people in pinglin still depend on tea for their livelihood . with the economy slowing down , however , tea is not as easy to sell as it used to be . in the past there used to be a vigorous export market , but the countries of southeast asia have cut into the market . pinglin has always specialized in quality teas rather than cater to the mass - production foreign tea markets , but if even domestic sales are having difficulties , what can the growers do to ensure their livelihoods ?
huang kuei - ying also comments that tea is n't as easy to sell as it once was .
growers are sometimes exploited by middlemen , and the tea grown with their sweat and blood ends up being sold for a very low price . " it 's terrible !
many growers just ca n't find words for what 's happening , especially with what 's going to happen later , joining that whatever - it - is trade organization . that could really be a disaster ! "
huang 's concerns may well be shared by many others .
nevertheless , mr. chen has deep confidence , " as long as our tea is good , we need n't fear that no - one will buy it ! "
the township chief , liang chin - sheng , does n't hide his pride in and his concerns about pinglin 's tea industry . says liang , " here in pinglin we worship tea as a god . we look after it like a sweetheart . "
as well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by - products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments .
but far more important , is to draw deeply on pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .
with this in mind they are training local people to do voluntary cultural work , organizing activities associated with tea , producing and conserving local gazetteers and histories , all richly steeped in the style and romance of tea .
speaking of the assaults they face with the opening of the market , the township chief knits his brows tightly , " i hope the government can do something substantial to promote taiwanese tea and draw up regulations for proper channels for marketing tea . let everyone see how good it is to drink tea , and experience for themselves tea 's benefits . this is the only way that tea will have a market ; and then the younger generation will be willing to take over from us . " hoping for fewer regulations in early times pinglin was a key waystation on the old tan lan trail leading from taipei to ilan .
these days the old road has been replaced by the taipei - ilan highway . the current road brings a lot of visitors to pinglin and has made transport of the tea produce much easier . it was originally thought that the taipei - ilan expressway , due for completion in 2003 , would also bring pinglin new benefits , but the government is now planning to restrict the interchange to only large vehicles and locals from pinglin .
this is in order to protect the water catchment area . the township chief throws up his hands and comments with exasperation that in everything the government has done it has treated the local people officiously and shown no confidence in them . in his view , the government should think of some way whereby both pinglin and the water resource protection zone can coexist and prosper .
if they 're afraid that the new expressway will bring hordes of people and pollute the water resources , then what they should do , within reasonable bounds , is allow the people here to build public facilities for visitors which will help minimise their impact on the local ecology , for example public toilets and comprehensive rubbish disposal . this would give people from outside the area more opportunity to appreciate pinglin 's idyllic natural setting .
the local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the peishih river is now protected . many prized species of taiwanese fish are being propagated . in the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to pinglin to camp out and observe the stars . the calloused hands of the tea growers are steeped with the vitality of tea . last year pinglin 's pouchong tea earned the " presidential seal . "
the tea growers straighten their backs , throwing themselves into the tea processing , and wait for their sons and grandsons to come home and enjoy a cup of fine tea with them .
so , next time you go to pinglin , please do n't just treat it as a quick pitstop .
sit down for a pot of some of the best tea in all of taiwan . pinglin facts and figures pinglin is located on the taipei - ilan highway , 38 km east of taipei , and 42 km west of ilan .
the area , covering 171 square kilometres , is mostly mountainous , with the fushih mountains to the north , the ayu mountains to the south , and the peishih river meandering through it . most of the population of more than 6000 is concentrated here in the river 's small floodplain .
pinglin township is part of the water resource protection zone around feitsui reservoir . the natural scenery is pure and fresh , serenely beautiful , and it 's a wonderful sightseeing destination .
whether you go to see the serenity of the old hutung trail , the yukuang nanshan temple , the natural landscape of chienshan lake , the chiuchiungken forest paths , air plants , and ancient pines , the shihkung chiwei mountain lookout , or go on a cross-country tour of the tea district , all will transport you into a world of beautiful mountain and river scenery .
pinglin 's main produce is tea , and its famous wenshan pouchong tea is pre-eminent amongst taiwan 's teas .
if you visit pinglin , you 'll want to enjoy the local brew and maybe buy some to take back home , but do n't forget to visit the ping lin tea museum .
it 'll help you understand much more about the world of tea . how to get there : by car , take the taipei ilan highway . you can also take a taiwan motor transport bus from taipei north station , or the pinglin bus from outside the public insurance building .

a chinese director makes her mark in australia
-lrb- teng sue - feng / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb-
some people are calling the 21st cent - ury the century of the dragon , and for ethnic chinese filmmakers there appears to be some truth to the designation .
first ang lee 's crouching tiger , hidden dragon won golden globes for best director and best foreign - language film as well as 10 oscar nominations , and then lin cheng - sheng won the silver bear at the berlin film festival for betelnut beauty .
clara law , who has earned renown in australia for floating life and the goddess of 1967 , is yet another ethnic chinese filmmaker winning awards at international festivals .
law has produced a remarkably varied body of work , which ranges from the realistic to the mythic and includes such films as farewell china and temptation of a monk .
she is especially gifted at describing the experiences of chinese emigrants . how did law , one of the last working woman directors from hong kong and taiwan , attain australian government film grants after emigrating there ?
weighing only about 40 kilos , law looks light enough to blow away in a strong wind , so it 's hard to imagine her barking out orders on a film set .
but when law and her husband eddie fong were invited to attend the taipei film festival last year , fong , who is also a screenwriter and director , revealed , " clara is very strong willed , and everyone in the australian film community knows that she ca n't be pushed around and rarely compromises . "
in the goddess of 1967 there is a scene where the girl who is the film 's leading character -lrb- played by rose byrne -rrb- and her mother encounter heavy winds in their car . the film crew had set up the lights to shoot this scene of a dust storm , when suddenly byrne said she was hungry and wanted to rest . " clara knew that she was n't really hungry , but rather that she just found it difficult to concentrate sometimes since it was the first time she had been in a film , so she told rose that she could n't eat .
the assistant director , who was australian , looked aghast , as if clara was a witch who was abusing a poor child . " the goddess of 1967 refers to a '67 chevy named " goddess . " in it a japanese man goes to australia to find the car of his dreams and happens to meet a blind girl named b.g. -lrb- byrne -rrb- .
the two take to the road , hoping to find some direction to their lives .
for her performance , byrne won the best actress award at last year 's venice film festival . this was the second film law and fong had made with australian government money since they immigrated there in 1994 .
-lrb- floating life was the first . -rrb- finding direction
law explains that their decision to move to australia was a well - laid plan , not a spur - of - the - moment thing .
in 1993 - 1994 , after shooting fruit punch and temptation of a monk in hong kong , the couple went to australia to visit relatives and rest . it was then that they discovered that the technical level of the australian film industry was very high . " the biggest problem with making films in hong kong is the lack of money budgeted for post-production , " law notes . " dolby sound costs a lot of money . "
they were extremely disappointed with the sound on autumn moon , so they decided to go to australia to redo it . when the film was subsequently presented at the sydney film festival , it was well received , and this brought them into contact with australian producers . " originally , we thought that we were just changing workplaces and would spend half the year in australia writing and then half the year in hong kong shooting , " law says . " we did n't expect that it would be our destiny to put down roots in australia . "
faced with hollywood 's cultural onslaught , governments around the world are offering grants to protect their own film industries . last year the australian government budgeted more than a$ 40 million -lrb- the equivalent of nt$ 700 million -rrb- for this purpose .
as long as a film has an outstanding plan and the backing of a production company and a distributor , it has a chance at getting a grant .
the amount of the grants vary , depending on the topic of a film .
for the goddess of 1967 , the australian government provided nearly nt$ 50 million , or 70 % of the total budget , fong explains .
furthermore , they allowed the director to exercise creative control . the only problem was that they imposed strict deadlines and a quota of jobs that had to be filled by australians , and they stipulated that australian actors must be given first priority .
so as to seek creative inspiration and find new material in a foreign land , the two bought a four - wheel - drive suv and explored all over australia . the desert both frightened and intrigued law : " i gradually began to feel that this ancient landscape was well suited to showing the loneliness of modern people , " she recalls . " it was a good match for my films . "
culture clash
law , who has now finished nine films , was born in macao in 1957 . in 1978 she graduated from the university of hong kong with a degree in english literature and found work in television . she directed 12 different tv movies before going to london to get her masters in 1982 , where she majored in screenplay writing and directing .
her thesis project , they say the moon is fuller , won a silver medal at the chicago film festival .
her first film after graduating was the 1988 work the other half and the other half , which explored the uncomfortable problem of spouses being separated by national boundaries , a familiar situation in hong kong , which is a cradle of emigration . it was the first hong kong film to deal with this theme . " i grew up amid two cultures , " law recalls .
" when i was little , my grandfather taught me to read chinese poems and do calligraphy . then , when i entered english school , i learned how to think in english .
it was n't until i went abroad for three years that i discovered i was in fact neither chinese nor english . " law says that from a young age all hong kongers learned that they were living in a borrowed place on borrowed time . her childhood friends would all go abroad to study . yet hong kong movies were n't acknowledging this problem . since movies were regarded merely as entertainment , studio bosses were n't willing to invest in films on these sort of topics , for they did n't think that audiences would come to see them . law 's second film , the reincarnation of golden lotus , was a modern adaptation of a classical chinese novel about the unusual woman pan jin - lian . it was a more polished work than her first film .
" although the story is intentionally macabre , " noted the hong kong critic shek kei , " the film displays law 's own style and succeeds with both its twists of plot and its portrayal of desire and killing for love .
law also does a good job of giving joey wang , who plays the reincarnation of an ancient chinese courtesan , a darkly beautiful aura . the film is visually interesting and entertaining .
law has created a new model for shooting mythic - type chinese films . " law 's third film , farewell china , was nominated for nine golden horses in 1990 , and was the chief competitor of red dust , which won that year 's golden horse for best picture .
red dust ended up winning eight golden horses , and farewell china took only three , including a best leading actor award for tony leung .
nevertheless , the film received excellent notices from critics . although law may have lost out in the competition for awards , the film still earned her renown .
some , however , criticized the story for being excessively grim . the film describes a chinese couple who are anxious to get out of the mainland . the wife , played by maggie cheung , first receives permission to leave for america .
after she gets there , her family loses all trace of her . her husband , played by leung , smuggles himself into america to try to find her . he ca n't speak english , and is penniless and destitute after his money is stolen by some homeless people .
after he accidentally kills a chinese gangster , he meets up with a young ethnic chinese girl and acts as her pimp , losing all dignity . meanwhile , his wife meets an even worse fate .
she lives in a decrepit basement , where she is raped .
in order to get a green card , she marries an old chinese man who is a citizen , and eventually goes insane . the various tragedies depicted in the film are rather hard to take . one critic wrote , " the director lays on the tragedy a little too thick . when the couple by chance meet up , one might expect a happy ending . but instead we get a crazy woman murdering her husband in front of the statue of liberty . it 's a bit over the top . "
nevertheless , some viewers could identify with the plot .
in one scene cheung 's character bicycles home to her run - down apartment with a discarded mattress on her back . " when she was struggling to get out of china , she would never have expected that she would end up like this in america , " wrote one woman on the internet . " when i saw this film as a 20 - year - old , i thought it was rather sensational . but when i was 25 and went to america , i discovered that it was quite true to life . "
a new tune in a foreign land two years later , law applied to have her film autumn moon compete for a golden horse .
much to her surprise , the awards committee refused her application because the film lacked a distributor in taiwan .
although not allowed to compete for a golden horse , it won the gold leopard award at the locarno film festival in switzerland , and with this award law began to receive notice in the international film community .
autumn moon , which was shot with japanese money , depicts a japanese man who goes to hong kong as a tourist when he is bored with his life .
he uses a video camera to make a record of his daily life there , and meets hui , a 15 - year - old girl who is about to emigrate .
although communication is difficult , they quickly become friends .
the girl 's parents have already emigrated to canada , leaving her behind with her grandmother . this " japanese older brother " becomes her close friend , and she often takes him home to eat meals cooked by her grandmother . the three of them talk past each other , but they are very much like a family , and these scenes are quite amusing .
the program of the taipei film festival describes this successful example of a chinese - language film shot with foreign money thus : " law masterfully portrays the wave of emigration that preceded the 1997 handover , as well as the withering of traditional culture and the loneliness and alienation experienced by modern people . " a year later , law shot temptation of a monk , which takes as its departure point the military plots surrounding the xuanwu gate incident during the tang dynasty . based on a novel by hong kong 's lillian lee , the film was entirely shot in the mainland and explores themes of sexual desire and zen buddhism .
the locations and scenery are stunningly beautiful , and the photography and art direction top - notch . joan chen , who plays two characters and actually shaved her head for the film , seduced audiences with her performances , appearing naked in several scenes .
" nevertheless , her characters are the biggest disappointments in the whole film , " wrote the hong kong critic shek kei . " she is n't made up to look attractive , with the result that she is n't adequately alluring .
her princess character is not well developed , and then she suddenly becomes a widow and then a spy and assassin . it 's all rather confusing . "
after making autumn moon and temptation of a monk , two highly stylized works , law went back to the theme of emigration at which she excels , getting a grant from the australian government to film floating life .
the result , both in terms of its visual and narrative techniques , was much more accessible .
unlike farewell china , which depicts a tragedy in a foreign land , floating life explores the problem of the generation gap between the first and second generation of chinese emigrants and the clash between chinese and western culture .
the story is set on the eve of the handover of hong kong from britain to the prc . it shows what a hong kong family with five children encounter when they immigrate to australia . farewell hong kong floating life was the first film that clara law made after moving to australia .
" many people just discuss floating life from the perspective of immigration , " law says , " but what i really intended to show was how fleeting life is , and how people go about surviving in rootless societies . "
we should try to adopt longer - term perspectives , she says , because in the end we 're all going to meet our maker .
the vast , virgin expanses of the australian continent have sparked a new creative fire in law .
the goddess of 1967 adopts such techniques used in television commercials as exaggerated contrasts of brightness , grainy film , and oversaturation of color . " the wonderfully weird visual style differs greatly from her old works , " notes the program of the taipei film festival .
" it 's the new australian law , not the old hong kong law . " the australian government was quite pleased with the film made by this scriptwriting and directing couple and has chosen floating life to be one of eight official australian entrants at international film festivals .
law seems to have found new creative energy in australia , where both her works have been about how people try to find themselves in the modern world .
" although we do n't know where we 're going , it is our journey . we hope that audiences will take to the road with us . "

a southeast asian singing star shines in taiwan -- sun yan zi
-lrb- eric lin / tr. by jonathan barnard -rrb-
in the year 2000 a singer in taiwan re-leased her debut album in the middle of the year and has been hot ever since . she 's the music market 's darling for the start of the century . her first album hit number one on the best seller list of rose records , a major retail chain .
then in december sales of her second album constituted one - quarter of all sales in the pop category . with this share , she surpassed even a - mei , the reigning queen of taiwan pop . in january three of the top ten requested songs at cashbox ktv were her songs .
and both the entertainment weekly put out by the china times and the music video station channel v selected her as last year 's " best newcomer . "
sun yan zi , this 23 - year - old from singapore has n't been here a full year , but her efforts are already bearing ample fruit .
what exactly are her charms ?
and does her success show that singers from southeast asia have successfully established a foothold in taiwan ? " when i threw temper tantrums / as a young girl / on summer afternoons / my grandmother would soothe me / by gently singing an old song / it went like this / the sky is dark /
it 's going to rain / the sky is dark ... are there always hidden flaws in the grown - up world ? / every day i come to forks in the road
... how lonely i 've become ! / when skies are dark / i recall that song / and hope to hear the peaceful sound of the falling rain / it turns out that grandma sang this song long ago / the rain is falling / but i 've got to boldly push ahead . " " dark skies , " sun 's first hit last june , caused an immediate sensation .
the critic g moon praised it as a marvelous blend of seemingly familiar melody and lyrics , with solo piano accompaniment from start to finish . people found sun 's singing voice fresh , clean and infectiously charming , and it quickly earned her a place in taiwan 's music world .
fresh and clean sun clearly occupies an enviable position in the singing world . yet it is hard to pin down exactly where that position is .
although she has written a few songs herself , these are not among her better works , so she can not be properly placed among the " singer - songwriters . " and while her voice sets her apart , she has not perfected her live performance skills , so she can not be included among the true divas . moreover , her short hair , buck teeth and aversion to wearing skirts and dresses would seem to exclude her from the teeny - bopper " idols . " finally , she ca n't be considered an innovator .
half her songs are slow and half are fast , and she has n't revealed much desire to experiment .
indeed , internet bulletin boards are full of posts wondering why exactly sun yan zi is so popular . " how did she get so popular overnight ?
her looks and voice are pretty average . " " she 's not beautiful , but her smile and singing voice are pleasing . she makes people feel comfortable . "
" she does n't really have any special quality to speak of , which seems to be the case with most of the southeast asian singers . "
peter li , the singaporean who produced both sun yan zi and my desire happiness for sun , admits that she was n't an outstanding student at his music academy , and that her rapid success has surprised many people . but he conjectures that the freshness and intimacy that she projects may be responsible for her success . citing " freshness , " the china times entertainment weekly awarded their prize for " best newcomer " to sun , " the girl with the boyish haircut . "
their panel of judges remarked , " she has good range without the frenzied style that characterizes so many . her fast songs have a fresh style , and her slow songs convey a soft melancholy . "
wang tzu - shou , a senior reporter at min sheng pao , describes her as the new generation 's feng fei - fei . " when the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like feng fei - fei , " wang notes . " sun yan zi fills this need perfectly . "
moreover , she has had the right material , with producer peter li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde .
this has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace . hence , though she is neither a singer - songwriter , nor an outstanding vocalist , nor a conventional teen idol , she has nevertheless been able to attain brilliant success in an era where premiums are placed on both " changing constantly " and " returning to the basics . " talent exchange in a weak market for recorded music , sun 's two albums have sold very well .
members of the media have quipped that those who work at taiwan 's warner music can thank two singaporeans , sun and her producer li , for any bonuses they made last year .
now people have started wondering if overseas chinese from southeast asia - and in particular from singapore and malaysia - are taking over the mainstream of the taiwanese music industry .
in earlier decades southeast asian singers were unusual here . in the 1970s and 1980s there was teng miao - hua and wen chang . then eric moo appeared on the scene in the 1990s . although these were all successful singers , they comprised a small group .
but in the last five years or so , there has been a steady stream of southeast asian singers making their mark in taiwan : mavis hee , mindy , kit chan , tanya chua , michael and victor , angelica lee , penny , fish leong , and tae kheng seong .
interestingly , almost all of them have been described as being " fresh and clean . "
moreover , even those who write their own material , such as tanya chua , michael and victor , and tae kheng seong , write simple folk songs .
although the southeast asians have n't had quite the impact of the returning overseas chinese from north america , they have staked out their piece of the pop music field .
music critic tsai yun - pu notes that the southeast asian singers are not as recognizable as their counterparts from north america , who have a hard - rocking , r&b style . the simple and catchy melodies and rhythms of the southeast asians sound a lot like those of the locals . taiwanese listeners quickly identify with these singers and may even forget where they come from . " taiwan is now the capital of mandarin pop music worldwide , " says tsai .
" if there 's a ' capital , ' then there are ' provinces . ' " the market is too small in southeast asia , so it has become de rigueur for southeast asian chinese singers to come to taiwan to advance their careers . those with talent are quickly adopted by local audiences . "
wang tzu - hsien argues that the growing dominance of multi-national companies in the taiwanese music field has fostered uniformity here , and the southeast asians have been able to step in and fill the need for greater creativity .
yet though their music may be " fresher , " on close inspection it does n't really differ that much from what is produced by the locals . it is , after all , produced for the same market .
although there may not be much that sets the southeast asians apart , the growing exchange of musical talent between taiwan and southeast asia has at least provided ample content for the gossip pages .
when sun wore a long jacket while shooting a music video , people could tell how excited she was at wearing a winter coat for the first time . at that moment , taiwan did n't seem to be that far from singapore , despite the latter 's endless summer weather . we all could sense a young woman 's joy at being accepted in foreign land that seemed at once familiar and exotic .

the development of shanghai 's pudong is in step with the establishment of its legal system
xinhua news agency , shanghai , february 10 , by wire -lrb- reporters jinhu xie and chijian zhang -rrb-
in recent years shanghai 's pudong has promulgated and implemented 71 regulatory documents relating to areas such as economics , trade , construction , planning , science and technology , culture and education , etc. , ensuring the orderly advancement of pudong 's development .
pudong 's development and opening up is a century - spanning undertaking for vigorously promoting shanghai and constructing a modern economic , trade , and financial center .
because of this , new situations and new questions that have not been encountered before are emerging in great numbers . in response to this , pudong is not simply adopting an approach of " work for a short time and then draw up laws and regulations only after waiting until experience has been accumulated . "
instead , pudong is taking advantage of the lessons from experience of developed countries and special regions such as shenzhen by hiring appropriate domestic and foreign specialists and scholars , by actively and promptly formulating and issuing regulatory documents , and by ensuring that these economic activities are incorporated into the sphere of influence of the legal system as soon as they appear .
precisely because as soon as it opened it was relatively standardized , china 's first drug purchase service center for medical treatment institutions , which came into being at the beginning of last year in the pudong new region , in operating up to now , has concluded transactions for drugs of over 100 million yuan and has n't had one case of kickback .
construction is a principal economic activity in developing pudong . these years there have been several hundred construction companies and over four thousand construction sites that have spread out all over this stretch of hot turf . in order to standardize construction procedures and to guard against the emergence of disorderly phenomena , the new region 's management committee promptly announced a series of documents for standardizing the construction market in accordance with the relevant national regulations and the regulations of shanghai municipality , while accommodating the realities of pudong 's development . the documents include : management methods for bidding on construction projects ; a certain number of regulations for demolition and removal work ; implementation methods for fixing construction that violated regulations ; construction suggestions for communications installations and cable setups ; provisional methods for environmental management at construction work sites ; etc . essentially they are worked out to the point where every single link has clearly defined and specific regulations .
when a construction company enters the region , first the appropriate bureau delivers these regulatory documents , and afterwards there is a specialized contingent that carries out a supervisory inspection .
in spite of the fact that of the regulatory documents that the pudong new region has formulated , some are relatively " crude " and some are still only provisional regulations awaiting step - by - step completion as they are put into practice , nevertheless , this kind of approach , with the legal system tightly coupled with economic and social activities , has received positive comments from domestic and foreign investors .
they believe that in coming to the pudong new region to invest there is methodicalness and attention to rules in the handling of business , and interests can receive safeguards . -lrb- end -rrb-

in 1995 , the economic construction of china 's fourteen border municipalities that are open to the outside attained gratifying results .
according to statistics , these municipalities last year fulfilled more than 19 billion yuan of the gross domestic product , growing more than 90 % compared to 1991 , before they had opened .
in 1992 the state council successively approved the 14 border municipalities heihe , pingxiang , hunchun , yining , ruili , etc. to be municipalities open to the outside . at the same time it also sanctioned those municipalities to set up fourteen border economic cooperation zones .
for more than three years , in these municipalities the social and economic development has been rapid , the local economic strength has clearly been enhanced , and their economies have grown with a yearly average of 17 % , which surpasses the entire country 's yearly average rate of growth .
according to a briefing , the pace of municipal construction and of construction for opening of the cooperation zones of these fourteen municipalities has accelerated .
in the past three years these municipalities collectively have put together investment in fixed assets in the amount of 12 billion yuan . the conditions of the border municipalities in former times , with " buildings that are n't high , roads that are n't level , lights that are n't bright , water that is n't clean , communications that are n't smooth , " have already undergone a transformation .
inside the economic cooperation zones , the municipalities have already developed 22.6 square kilometers , introduced 287 " three capital " enterprises , and put to concrete use 890 million us dollars of foreign capital .
beyond this , they also have 5,100 enterprises with ties inside the country and have already put 175 industrial projects into operation .

in recent years the pace of opening up to the outside of china 's construction market has further accelerated .

among the 225 largest international contractors world wide , ten or more have already entered china and among them not a few companies have carried out construction with chinese companies through joint ownership or cooperative ventures .
according to the regulations of the construction bureau , all chinese construction enterprises set up abroad with chinese capital that belong to projects that are funded by international financial organizations or were publicly bid for internationally , or to projects that were constructed completely using foreign investment or donations , as well as to chinese - foreign joint ownership construction projects that domestic enterprises would be hard pressed to independently contract for on technical grounds , after they obtain china 's examination and approval for a foreign enterprise project contracting capital and quality license , all are permitted to enter china 's territory and contract for construction projects .
" a number of regulations concerning establishing foreign - invested construction enterprises , " jointly issued by the construction bureau and the bureau of foreign economics and trade in september , 1995 , enabled china 's construction market to advance from one permitting chinese enterprises set up abroad with chinese capital to come to china to contract on a project to one permitting chinese enterprises set up abroad with chinese capital to come to china to manage joint - ownership construction enterprises .

a few years ago , beihai was still an unknown small fishing village on the northern gulf , yet within three to five years , beihai has constructed the framework of a modernized city : on the streets people flow like the tide and buildings spring from the ground .
beihai has already become a bright star arising from china 's policy of opening up to the outside world .
beihai city 's rise to prominence is one of the important indicators of the remarkable achievements attained by the guangxi zhuangzu autonomous region in its recent years of opening up to the outside world .
now , guangxi has initially formed an overall pattern of opening up to the outside world at various fields and levels , which is characterized by mutually linking together opening coastal cities , opening coastal economic zones , and opening border cities and towns , and advancing from the seacoasts , the borders , and the river borders towards the hinterland .

xinhua news agency , beijing , february 29th , by reporter jinsheng zhang the national statistical bureau forecasts that the global economy will continue growing in 1996 and that this favorable situation is extremely beneficial for china 's development and will provide many development opportunities .
according to the forecast , this year 's global economic growth rate will reach 4.1 percent .
the main factor promoting economic growth is the still powerful economic development in the asian region . the whole region 's economic growth rate will reach 7.9 percent , with china 's growth rate possibly being as high as 9.7 percent .
according to the analysis of the national statistical bureau , the extremely favorable conditions for china 's economic development mainly comprise of two aspects : the first being the sustained growth of the world economy and international trade , which indicates the steady expansion of international market demands , provides a comparatively favorable international environment for china 's export trade development .
the second is china 's large margin reduction of tariffs in 1996 which will further improve its investment environment and attract more foreign businessmen to come to invest .
the analysis shows that , with the situation of greater opportunity and extremely favorable international situations , china 's economic development still faces severe challenges this year .
with a background of rapid economic development , there still exist many difficulties , among these are outstanding problems such as inflation , a weak agricultural base , insufficient vitality in state - owned enterprises , etc .
while implementing global trade liberalization , china must implement reforms on state - owned enterprises so as to improve its own competitiveness .
currently , some state - owned enterprises are having management difficulties , moreover the debt of state - owned enterprises reaches as high as 700 billion yuan , and their product quality is uneven . if there is no improvement , it will be very difficult for them to participate in the competition in overseas markets .
according to analysis , at present , the rising speed of developing countries ' economies also makes china face fierce international competition in domains such as attracting foreign funds , introducing technology , expanding markets and developing high - tech industries , etc .

today , the " '96 seminar on the actual practice of tax reform and accounting system for imported raw materials " , jointly sponsored by the guangdong branch of the china trade promotion council and the hong kong chinese general chamber of commerce , was held in guangzhou to introduce visiting businessmen from hong kong , macao and mainland to the three main policy adjustments for foreign economy and trade to be implemented by the state this year .
the three policy adjustments for foreign economy and trade to be implemented by the state this year include : reducing the export tax refund rate , implementing the bank accounting system of deposits for imported raw materials and parts for the processing trade , and canceling of preferential duty free treatment for imported equipment .
of the three adjustments , the bank accounting system of deposits for the processing trade to be implemented nationally in july became the focus of concern of visiting businessmen from hong kong and macao .
according to presentations , in recent years , foreign economy and trade in guangdong has been rapidly developing , including customer 's processed materials , imported processed materials , and processing trade undertaken by foreign investment enterprises , which occupies quite a large proportion .
last year , the total export value of guangdong 's processing trade reached 40 billion us dollars , accounting for approximately 80 % of the province 's total export value .
among that , half of regular trade , 100 % of customer 's material processing and more than eighty percent of the processing by foreign investment enterprises belong to processing trade exports .
at present there are more than five million people in the province engaged in the processing trade . enterprises in the " three sources of raw materials and one compensation " production alone have reached more than 30,000 engaging over two million employees .
in recent years , manufacturers from taiwan have also established more than 7,000 processing enterprises in guangdong .
the processing trade occupies a crucial position in the development of foreign economy and trade in guangdong and at the same time is important content in the economic and trade cooperation between guangdong , hong kong , macao and taiwan .
a relevant person in charge from the committee of foreign economic relations and trade of guangdong points out that the implementation of the accounting system for the processing trade is to perfect supervision of the processing trade , to fill in management loopholes , to prevent the loss of national revenue and to promote healthy development of the processing trade .
after implementing the accounting system of deposits , customs will no longer levy risk deposits equivalent to the tax for imported materials and parts from enterprises dealing with normally developing processing trade , but at the time an account is established with the bank , collect a handling charge of one hundred yuan , and therefore , will lighten the actual economic burden .
according to reports , in dongguan city , a processing trade accounting system experimental city , dongguan area customs received in total more than 8,400 contract records from enterprises from december 27th of last year to march 15th of this year , slightly increasing compared to before the experiment .
enterprises have reacted favorably and have generally expressed acceptance . -lrb- end -rrb-

relying on the 300,000 ton maoming ethylene project , the shuidong development zone continuously strengthens its attraction for overseas investment and is becoming the new investment hotspot of southern china .
xiaolue liang , the vice director of the shuidong development administrative committee , says that since the establishment of the development zone in march , 1992 , foreign businessmen from more than twenty countries and regions , such as japan , germany , south korea , the us , etc. , have signed contracts with a total planned investment reaching 4.5 billion yuan rmb for ethylene product follow - up processing projects in the shuidong development zone .
thus , currently , traveling businessmen in the shuidong development zone that have already signed agreements or contracts has reached more than 750 , including those from over twenty domestic provinces and cities , with a total investment that will top 15 billion yuan and actual capital in place of more than 3 billion yuan , with the number of projects already under construction reaching more than 160 .
the shuidong development zone , located in maoming city in western guangdong and occupying an area of over 80 square kilometers , is a follow - up processing base established to meet the needs of the ethylene project .
the possession a natural year - round deep - water ice - free port is a favorable condition of the shuidong development zone for developing ethylene follow - up processing projects .
in recent years , the development zone built several berths at the 10,000 ton class , 20,000 ton class , 30,000 ton class and 50,000 ton class on the base of its original two 3000 ton class berths .
the whole country 's largest single - point mooring , crude oil loading and unloading system of 250,000 tons has already been put into use .
the annual handling capacity of the port is nearly 15 million tons and the zone has been approved by the state council to be a first - class open port .
this aside , the shuidong development zone has invested several hundred million yuan in the construction of infrastructure such as roads , water supply , electricity supply , telecommunications , etc .
currently , municipal roads within the development zone have formed the modern pattern of " three longitudes and six latitudes " . other installations are also being perfected daily , resulting in the creation of conditions for large scale development and construction .
it is reported that the maoming 300,000 ton ethylene project will formally turn on production in the second half of this year . some large scale international enterprises are also accelerating preparation work for construction of the follow - up processing projects , included among them are japan 's itochu corporation and korea 's lg chemical group which invests 3 billion yuan and 1.5 billion yuan respectively .

the second construction phase of the anyang color kinescope glass - shell co. , ltd. , designed and built using chinese initiative , and meeting current world - wide advanced technological levels , today finished construction and started operations .
the vice premier of the state council , jiahua zou , attended the ribbon cutting ceremony held today for the start of operations .
according to the introduction , the completion of construction and startup of operations of anbo 's second project phase enabled anbo co. 's yearly production capacity of colored glass - shells to expand from the six million cases of the first phase up to eleven million cases , turning it into china 's largest production base for colored glass - shells in terms of current scale of production .
after the start of operations , it was then able to produce the complete set of color kinescope glass - shells for color tvs and was also able to produce the complete set of color kinescope glass - shells for computer monitors . the specifications go from 35 cm straight up to 84 cm . it simultaneously laid a foundation for the next step of independently developing and producing high clarity glass - shells and wide - screen color tv glass - shells .
the anbo company is a key project in china 's nationalization of the production of color tvs , which china built up during the " seventh five - year plan " period -lrb- 1986 - 1990 -rrb- with wholesale introduction of foreign advanced technology and implementation of general technological contracts from outside .
since it started production in 1991 , altogether it has completed close to 1,000 technological improvements and development projects and has independently developed more than 20 new products and new types of products , including large - screen color tv glass - shells . yearly output exceeded designed capability by 78 % , last year already attaining 7.12 million cases . the share of the domestic market of the products and the percent coverage of the kinds of products reached 70 % and 90 % , respectively . at the same time it resold to japan and exported to countries like korea and india .
since starting production , cumulatively it has realized composite economic benefits of 1.06 billion yuan and earned 48.56 million us dollars through exports and remittances , which is enough to recoup the total fixed investment of the first project phase .
to accelerate the establishment and development of the colored glass industry of china 's nationalities , the people of anbo , in the construction of the second project phase , boldly adopted the completely new ways of thinking of " being one 's own master , widely adopting the strong points of the people , having a unique style , individually creating a system " and of " general contracting one 's own skills , from a high starting point optimizing the two types of resources , international and domestic " and attained the approval of the leadership of the state council and the vigorous support of the relevant national departments .
they worked many wonders that attracted the widespread attention of those in the same business inside and outside the country . number one was the fact that it took only thirteen months from november 18 , 1994 , when ground was broken and construction started , up until the drill - furnace fire lighting was successful . compared to anbo 's first phase the time period for the project was shortened by eighteen months , and compared to the fastest construction globally for comparable projects , it still was 5 months in advance . two was bringing about the optimum combination of resources such as domestic and foreign trained personnel , skills , equipment , design and construction , etc .
no matter what the hardware deployment or the software usage , everything met the current advanced standards for its industry internationally . three , compared with a wholesale introduction of foreign techniques and equipment , investment was greatly economized .
according to measurements and calculations , the actual investment in anbo 's second project phase only amounted to one - half of what the total investment would be for a comparable project that at present domestically would be built using a wholesale introduction of foreign techniques and equipment . -lrb- end -rrb-

" five years ago , when china 's digital telephone program - controlled switch market was monopolized by various brands of foreign products , we worried about whether china could successfully develop digital program - controlled switches .
today , domestically produced high - performance telephone program - controlled telephone switches already account for 36 % of the domestic market share . "
" when china 's national meteorological bureau bought mainframe computers from cray inc. of the u.s. , it just sold us two processors .
today , the maximum computing speed of the ' dawn 1000 ' computer we developed ourselves has already reached 2.5 billion operations per second , exceeding the speed of the computer sold to us by cray inc. "
this is part of the speech delivered at the working meeting of the " 863 program " today by jian song , state council member and concurrently director of the national science commission .
the " 863 program " is china 's high - tech research program , initiated in 1986 .
western developed countries have always restricted the export of important high - tech products , such as high - performance large - scale digital telephone program - controlled switches and supercomputers , to china .
jian song said that " today , china is capable of producing more than 10,000 sets of digital telephone program - controlled switches , and the chief designer of this kind of switch is only 28 years old , graduating from wuhan university . "
most of the research staff who successfully developed the ' dawning 1000 ' computer last year are young people about 30 years old .
today , jian song said to hundreds of high - tech experts representatives and science and technology officials attending the meeting : " the series of achievements we have made in the development and industrialization of high - tech help us to further overcome timid thoughts that high - tech is unattainable . they have greatly enhanced our whole nation 's courage and confidence in realizing socialist modernization . "
the " 863 program " , with a total investment of 10 billion yuan rmb and a duration of 15 years , since its implementation in 1986 , has gained breakthroughs in a large number of significant key fields of technology . it has greatly narrowed the gap between china 's high - tech and the internationally advanced levels , and has promoted the modernization of civilian industry and the national defense industry .
in the civilian fields of biotechnology , information technology , automation technology , energy technology and new materials technology alone , more than 1200 research achievements have been made , of which 560 have reached internationally advanced levels .
this aside , china has scheduled more than 400 research projects in the fields of aerospace technology and laser technology , involving space science and application , jumbo carrier rockets , space stations , space shuttle transportation systems , and has made phased achievements in certain key technology fields .
jian song also cited the significant achievements that the internationally advanced level gained in fields such as agricultural biotechnology , biomedicine , genetic engineering , lasers , robotics , etc . for example , a chinese developed genetically engineered hepatitis b vaccine and an " a " interferon for blocking the progress of hepatitis b have entered the market , which is good news for the 120 million hepatitis b virus carriers in china .
later stages of hepatitis b often develop into liver cancer .
china has determined its focus of high - tech research for the coming five years , and set about drawing up the next century 's high - tech research plans .
finally , jian song said , " whether our own high - tech and its industry can be successful is related to the success or failure of china 's undertaking of modernization , and is related to the rise and fall of the chinese people .

at the same time as this , the fast - growing strong " three - capital " enterprises and people - managed and privately managed economies will also maintain rapid growth .
zheng han , director of the shanghai planning committee says that in the next three years the appropriate growth of shanghai 's consumer demand could also support the average annual gdp growth rate to reach 10 % to 11 % .
by experts ' forecast and calculation , in the next three years , the total amount of shanghai 's fixed assets investment is estimated to be 600 to 700 billion yuan , the total amount of consumer retail products is estimated to have an average annual growth rate of 13 % to 14 % , and foreign trade export is estimated to have an average annual growth rate of 10 % to 12 % . all this fits in with the average annual gdp growth rate of 10 % to 11 % .
kuangdi xu , mayor of shanghai , stresses that realizing per capita gdp of 5000 us dollars in shanghai by the end of this century is well - grounded and possible ; but shanghai is also facing the pressure of intensified market competition and the problems of some outstanding contradictions in its economic life .
he says that to meet the challenge and meet the goal , shanghai will promote a new round of industry restructuring , boldly implement state - owned enterprise reforms , and actively exploit new fields for opening up to the outside world to allow shanghai 's economy to again move onto a new stage .

on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of asean , the heads of the nine asean countries and the heads of china , japan and south korea held an informal meeting in kuala lumpur , capital of malaysia , on the 15th .
the next day , the heads of china , japan and south korea held informal meetings again with the heads of the asean countries separately .
this informal meeting of heads of eastern asian countries , the first time in history , is a good start .
after the end of the cold war , asean confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .
asean , with china , japan and south korea , strengthened their cooperation and jointly planned development , becoming a force that holds the balance .
therefore , the holding of the informal meeting of heads of the countries in eastern asia possesses important significance in promoting cooperation between all countries , in safeguarding regional and global security , and in accelerating the development towards world multi-polarization .
the development of countries can not be separated from the region , and that of the region can not be separated from the globe .
discarding old concepts and establishing new international political and economic orders conforms with the main trend of the times in which people of all countries demand peace , request development , seek stability and promote cooperation .
to correctly understand the relationship between economic development , political stability , social harmony and national security , to diligently promote all countries , regions and the whole world to travel on the road of peaceful development , to jointly discuss east asian economic cooperation in the 21st century and forecasting the future development of eastern asia are subjects being discussed at this informal meeting of heads of state in eastern asia .
peace is a precondition to economic development .
without a peaceful environment , any construction undertaking would be impossible to discuss .
only when long - term peace is realized can the realization of sustained development be possible .
therefore it is necessary to breed a new kind of security concept and to seek new methods to safeguard peace .
to establish relations between countries on the basis of the five principles , namely mutual respect of sovereignty and integrity of territory , non-aggression , non-interference in internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , is the political basis and precondition for global and regional security .
that all countries strengthen their mutual benefits and cooperation in the field of economy , open up to each other , eliminate inequalities and discriminatory policies in economic and trade transactions , gradually narrow the development gaps between countries and strive for joint prosperity is the economic basis for global and regional security .
that all countries promote mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and cooperation , and promise to settle disputes and conflicts between countries in peaceful ways is a realistic way to ensure peace and security .
this year some countries in eastern asia encountered financial turmoil and have had some difficulties in their economic development , but the economic basis of east asian countries is still good and advantageous factors for economic development still exist .
in the course of this meeting , leaders of east asian countries unanimously supported the suggestion to expand local trade and investment .
it is believed that after reviewing experience and implementing proper adjustments , the economy of eastern asia will definitely continue to move forward in development .
the east asian countries are not entirely without conflicts and disputes .
but in order to safeguard fundamental benefits to the people of all east asian countries , and to promote the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind , we must progressively strengthen the east asian cooperation .
chairman zemin jiang solemnly elaborated on china 's stand at this meeting .
he emphatically pointed out that " we should uphold the principles of mutual respect , equal participation , mutual benefit , and co-development ; we should strengthen cooperation in economy and technology , especially in the field of new high level technology , and establish reasonable regional economic structures , and form a mode of economic cooperation on the basis of learning from others ' strengths and offsetting others ' weaknesses , and mutual benefiting from advantages , balancing interests , and practicing non-exclusiveness and non-discrimination ; and we should strengthen trust , broaden common understanding , seek common points while maintaining differences , and resolve disputes appropriately through friendly dialogue and consultation to guarantee the region 's peace and stability . "
everything is difficult at the very beginning .
with this good start , people have good reason to believe that the coordination and cooperation between east asian countries will certainly show more hopeful prospects in the near future .

a few years ago , us bristol - myers squibb company established its first joint venture enterprise in china in shanghai , with an investment of only 5 million us dollars .
the us side only took this as a small window for watching over chinese markets .
now , this multinational group has successively added investments of more than 20 million us dollars in shanghai , and will develop squibb -lrb- shanghai -rrb- pharmaceutical company , ltd. into its production and export center in the asia - pacific region .
squibb 's -lrb- shanghai -rrb- gross sales volume of will reach 1 billion yuan in rmb this year .
defu zhou , company board chairman says that through squibb -lrb- shanghai -rrb- , us bristol - myers squibb company has tasted the sweetness of investing in china , and now the group 's total investment in china has exceeded 100 million us dollars .
after a period of " testing the waters " , more and more foreign businesses like bristol - myers squibb have begun to think highly of the investment environment and market potential in shanghai , and have one after another , added investments to expand reproduction , and will gradually build shanghai into their chinese and even asia - pacific region operational and sales center .
economic experts analysis say this shows that many multinational companies progressively think more highly of the political and economic situation in china and even shanghai , and have begun to rearrange their overall operational strategy in china , turning gradually from the scattered , non-systematic and individual investment of the early period to the comparatively large - scaled , systematized investment , and from building production bases to implementing integrated development of products at all levels - high , middle and low . meanwhile , the investment scope has also been expanded from industrial manufacturing to domains such as bank , insurance , consultation , trade , etc .
the statistics from the shanghai foreign investment working committee show that by the end of november of this year , investments added by foreign investment enterprises in shanghai reached as high as 4.89 billion us dollars , accounting for 17 % of the total foreign investment that the whole city attracted .
faced with an upsurge of additional investment by foreign businesses of various countries the shanghai government expressed that they will work more diligently to perfect the investment environment , provide more standard operation space for foreign businesses , and strive to reach the aim of 1/4 of the total amount of the foreign capital coming from the foreign business added investment by the end of this century .
a latest investment environment survey here shows that investors from the us , japan , the european economic community , etc. commonly think that the integrated conditions of shanghai 's investment environment possess an obvious advantage .
shanghai , which has entered into the post-industrialization mid-development stage , has been providing wide investment scope for foreign businesses from various countries .
shanghai is the largest modernized industrial city in china and has complete industry categories , developed infrastructure and perfect municipal functionality .
the financial center , business center and shipping center of the inland of china are also here .
the pudong development and the yangtze river valley development strategy spearheaded by shanghai implemented by the central government have redoubled the strength of this city .
the good investment environment makes the success rate of investment by foreign businesses in shanghai reach 80 % .
whereas the return rate always ranking first in the country is another important reason for attracting foreign businesses to continuously add investments .
the shanghai minhang development zone , which last year achieved a return on investment rate reaching as high as 32 % , has had more than 10 foreign investment enterprises add investments from the first quarter to the third quarter of this year .
in the new pudong area , more than 10 multinational companies , including mitsubishi , sumitomo , matsushita electric industrial , sharp , etc. have added investments of 500 million us dollars , which is more than twice the original investment of these companies .

compared to the forecast that the above - mentioned organization published in october , this is lower by 0.1 and 0.8 percentage points , respectively .
the imf furthermore lowered the forecasts of next year 's economic growth for a large number of regions and countries .
according to its newest estimates , the rate of economic growth of industrialized countries this year will be 3.9 % and next year it will be 3.6 % .

the report observed that if economic and banking policies are effective , the economies of the asian region hopefully would start rising again in 1999 , but they would not be likely to exhibit a large , high - speed , v - shaped rise like that of mexico and argentina following the fiscal crisis of 1994 - 1995 .
if reform measures are not effective , a crisis of confidence will still exist , and in that case there is the possibility that investors will turn their attention to other , newly rising markets .

as the largest nickel production base in asia , the largest nickel flash - melting furnace in asia and the 5th of the kind in the world is erected here . it is a symbol of china 's nickel industry technology striding into the world 's advanced ranks .
nickel , called the " vitamin of modern industry " , and with more than 3,000 varieties of alloy , it is the material specially required to develop space - flight , aviation , military and modern science and technology .
in 1958 , china 's geological mineral workers discovered the world 's second largest nickel mine in jinchuan , gansu , with a reserve of 5.53 million tons , accounting for 70 % of china 's domestic proven reserves .
in 1964 , jinchuan company produced the first batch of electrolytic nickel .
from then on , the situation of china 's long time dependence on import for nickel , cobalt and platinum family metals has been changed gradually .
up to now , this place has become china 's largest nickel and cobalt production base and platinum family metals refining center , with an output of nickel and platinum family metals that respectively account for more than 88 % and 90 % of the whole country respectively , being praised as china 's " nickel capitol " .
in 1978 , the jinchuan company was listed by the chinese government as one of the top three bases of integrated utilization of national mineral resources . since then , this enterprise , as a representative of china 's nickel industry , began to step onto its vigorous development road by relying on advances in science and technology .
in the span of 19 years , hundreds of experts and scholars from more than 50 scientific research schools and institutes as well as construction units in china together with the science and technology personnel of jinchuan company , launched large - scale scientific and technological allied offensives focusing firmly on such key problems as mine construction at jinchuan , production maximization , environmental protection , etc .
according to statistics , they have implemented a total of 599 specialty research items , and achieved 186 items of significant scientific research results , among which 139 items won provincial , departmental level and higher level awards and 11 items reached internationally advanced levels .
among these research results , 138 items were applied to production by enterprises to " spin gold from straw " , which greatly raised the production level of china 's nickel industry .
data show that the recoverable valuable elements at jinchuan company have increased from originally 7 kinds to 14 kinds , that the net increase of selective and smelting nickel recovery is 26.5 % and that the rate of smelting recovery of precious metals has increased more than 10 times .
after starting the second phase of the jinchuan project in 1988 , which the chinese government invested a total sum of 2.66 billion yuan in and listed as a national key construction project , the jinchuan company further accelerated its pace of technology advancement .
seeing this as a juncture , it worked hard to improve china 's nickel industry 's level of technology , technique and equipment .
they introduced new technology and advanced equipment from various countries around the world , heavily adopted the country 's latest domestic scientific research results , and built a 6500 meter long primary slope mine shaft - the longest in asia . they worked out a cement filling mining method , so that the average quantity mined per person per shift is 17.6 tons , reaching an internationally advanced level . they introduced key technology and equipment using 260 million yuan rmb and , through digestion and absorption , built china 's first , asia 's largest , and the world 's 5th nickel flash - melting furnace and brought china 's nickel smelting technology into the world 's leading ranks .
jinyi yang , general manager of jinchuan company said that jinchuan 's second phase project was neither a reproduction or extension of first phase technology or management , nor simply increasing production capacity by expanding production scale . it was an attempt to catch up with and surpass the advanced levels of the world in nickel production technology and techniques , and practice for combining introduced technology and domestic scientific research .
currently , the jinchuan company 's quality products value has reached 89.89 % .
more than 10 varieties of its products , such as electrolytic nickel , sulphuric nickel , platinum and rhodium products , stainless steel products , etc. , have been exported to such countries us , japan , uk , france , iran , united arab emirates , saudi arabia , etc .

the chinese government recently pointed out that it would take about 3 years to extricate the majority of large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises with a deficit from their current plight through reforming , restructuring , renovating and strengthening management .
it would , by the end of this century , endeavor to make the majority of large and medium - sized key state - owned backbone enterprises preliminarily establish modern enterprise systems .
currently , the state council is researching and laying down specific plans and policies for the 3 - year state - owned enterprise reform .
tieying li pointed out that china would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state - owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise . when rebuilding state - owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent - subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .
the development of a number of large companies and large groups through purchase , merger and alliance that would combine industry , technology and trade and would operate across regions , across industries , across systems of ownership and across countries needs to be encouraged .
according to statistics , at present , china has more than 300,000 state - owned enterprises of which 14,500 are large and medium - sized enterprises .
in the recent period , the momentum of china 's state - owned enterprise reform has obviously increased , and inter-enterprise purchases , mergers and " powerful alliances " have reached a fixed scale .
tieying li said that housing system reform needs to focus on establishing new mechanisms of benefit allotment monetization , and needs to accelerate the process of transforming housing allotments and tangibles to payments .
when talking about rural system reform , tieying li stressed that the household - factory contract responsibility system needs to persist unchanged for a long time , a system of land rights and compensated circulation needs to be actively sought and established and land scaled operations need to be promoted . through reform , a grain circulation system with a clear division of central and local responsibilities and rights which would be under national macroscopic control and would meet the needs of the socialist market economy and would suit the national situation needs to be gradually established .
through implementing industrialized agricultural operations , peasants ' income and local fiscal revenues should be increased and new economic growth spots should be cultivated .
tieying li said that china had the determination and confidence to reach the target of preliminarily establishing a socialist market economy system by the end of this century . planned key breakthroughs should be made on some system factors that inhibit establishing new systems so as to accelerate realizing a new phase of resource deployment marketization , benefit allotment monetization , public service socialization , economic operation legalization , and initiating economic system reform .

xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 30th , taipei
jiaju hou , a taiwan economist , published an article with the title " three comments on ' do n't rush , be patient ' " in taiwan 's " daily economy " on monday , pointing out that taiwan authorities ' adopting a " do n't rush , be patient " restriction policy for taiwan businessmen investing in our country 's mainland would give rise to many abuses .
jiaju hou points out that taiwan authorities say that " do n't rush , be patient " is to restrict large - sized taiwan companies from going to china 's mainland to invest and would have no impact on medium - and small - sized companies , but this is actually not the case .
currently , taiwan authorities define medium - and small - sized companies as having capital of under 60 million taiwan dollars , but actually taiwan 's current medium - and small - sized companies mostly have significant scale . taking medium and small - sized companies listed last year as top ten for example , the smallest net operating revenue of these was 3.365 billion taiwan dollars , the highest reached 10 billion taiwan dollars .
obviously , implementing a " do n't rush , be patient " policy will result in losing many business opportunities in our country 's mainland for no reason .
jiaju hou believed that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also have influence on exports to our country 's mainland .
because , among exports from taiwan to our country 's mainland , a large portion are due to taiwan businessmen investing in setting up factories in our country 's mainland and needing to ship spare parts for machines and equipment and intermediate raw materials .
in recent years , taiwan 's trade surplus with our country 's mainland has accumulatively reached 80 billion us dollars , which is almost the same as taiwan 's foreign currency reserve .
while the financial storm shows no sign of relief today , the importance of this surplus is more and more obvious .
how can taiwan decrease exports to our country 's mainland for the sake of " do n't rush , be patient " ?
because this will reduce its trade surplus with our country 's mainland .
jiaju hou pointed out that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also restrain foreign businessmen from investing in taiwan .
because most foreign businessmen investing in taiwan want to take this opportunity to jointly invest in our country 's mainland with taiwan investments .
therefore , this policy , while blocking the development of local enterprises , will also limit foreign businessmen 's wishes to invest in taiwan .
it is reported that jiaju hou has successively published 3 articles in taiwan newspapers on the " do n't rush , be patient " policy , pointing out to taiwan authorities that this erroneous mainland economic and trade policy violates the " basic philosophy of free economy " , and hopes that taiwan authorities " are warned of the consequences " .

in recent years , a large number of foreign enterprises of great strength and great developmental vision have entered the new york stock exchange .
according to statistics , currently , foreign enterprises listed on the new york stock exchange have reached more than 340 , tripling the figure 5 years ago .
according to presentations by people from the new york stock exchange , in the early '90's , big enterprises entering the new york market were mainly from economically developed countries in europe , japan , etc. , but things have changed in recent years . the number of non-governmental enterprises from countries in central and south america , such as mexico , argentina , etc. , that have come to new york to enter the market has distinctly increased . powerful enterprises from developing countries in asia and the middle and eastern europe , including russia , china , etc. are beginning to be listed on the new york stock exchange .
currently , the number of countries and regions whose enterprises are listed on the new york stock exchange is almost 50 .
last year , there were 61 foreign enterprises recently listed on the new york stock exchange , creating the highest record in the history .
last year , 145 types of stocks were recently listed on the new york stock exchange , of which 42 % were issued by foreign enterprises .
on the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed on the us securities exchange market is the continuous and steady increase of the us economy , and that the new york stock exchange is a relatively ideal place for raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .
statistics show that , capital that foreign enterprises raised on the new york stock exchange has reached 60 billion us dollars since 1992 .
but financial experts from wall street warn that , foreign enterprises entering the new york stock exchange , to a large extent , means that these enterprises need to adopt the strict operations and financial management methods of the us .
if foreign enterprises still lack the conditions to apply these methods , they should not rush blindly to enter the new york market , lest they be left out in the cold .

after the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of china 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
official authorities revealed that this year the chinese government determined that the economic growth rate was 8 % and price levels will be controlled within 3 % .
this means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
people in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
the growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the state planning commission , the statistical bureau and the china academy of social sciences , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
moreover , the impact of southeast asia 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
on the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro-economic policy will not be changed .
the key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the second half year of 1993 obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro-economic situation tends to loosen , china 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
this year , china plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
fixed assets investments will grow by 10 % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by 10 % and export growth by 8 % .
at the same time , the financial deficit will be reduced by 10 billion yuan .
after bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized state owned enterprises , the pace of state owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by 20 % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized state owned enterprises will gradually form .
however , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
china has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within 3.5 % through implementation of a large scale " re-employment " project .
according to estimates , after three years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
agriculture 's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of china 's economy has reached 42 % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
people in economic circles said that china should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
forecasting the year of the tiger , although china 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

information from the ministry of foreign trade and economic said that , after high - speed development in previous years , china 's foreign investment attracting has entered an adjustment period .
statistic figures show that , from january to november in 1997 , the number and contract sum of recently approved foreign investment projects decreased by 15.39 % and 33.52 % respectively over the same period last year , the amount of average foreign investment per project decreased 21.33 % over the same period last year , and the proportion of industrial projects in recently approved projects also decreased by 5.4 % .
since reform and opening up to the outside world , china has been promoting attracting foreign investment even more as an important part of the basic national policy of opening up , the past five years have been five years when foreign merchants ' investments grew fastest , and foreign investments have stepped into the majority of fields of china 's national economy .
the amount of foreign investment actually utilized by china has been increasing in successive years , creating an historical high in 1997 , and a number of projects with particularly intensified technologies and funds have appeared .
on the other hand , since 1994 and 1995 , the number of recently approved foreign investment projects and the contract sum has been continually decreasing , which will directly affect china 's foreign investment attraction growth rate in the period to come .
experts concerned pointed out that , after high - speed development in previous years , decelerating of the rate of china attracting foreign investment was normal .
however , at the beginning of this year , concerned parties announced that , for projects that had foreign invested , and which were in fields encouraged by china such as the new , high technology industry , infrastructure , etc. , the country would implement certain preferential taxation policies .
according to estimates , these policies would attract more foreign companies to invest in china .

in the recently past 1997 , in china 's import and export trade , state - owned enterprises and foreign - invested enterprises advanced together , state - owned enterprises continue to take the leading position , whereas foreign - invested enterprises are still playing an important role .
the intervention of foreign - invested enterprises has increased the international competitiveness of chinese import and export products , and also widened trade channels .
increasing the export of mechanical and electrical products is one of the strategic goals of china 's foreign trade , to which foreign - invested enterprises that were established in china have made great contributions .
in 1996 , among products exported by foreign - invested enterprises , industrial finished products accounted for 95.7 % , of which the value of mechanical and electrical products accounted for nearly 56 % of the total value of exported mechanical and electrical products nationwide .
the proportion had another increase in 1997 .

in nanchang , another recently built international container terminal was made available for operation recently , thereby further improving conditions of the existing external passageway of jiangxi , an inland province .
near the container dock which was built on ganjiang port , units such as nanchang customs , provincial sanitation inspection , commodity inspection , animal and plant quarantine , etc. established the " freight management area for the nanchang port of the nanchang freight port " .
the local officials said that , the previous situation whereby large numbers of import and export goods of jiangxi province had to be re-shipped through the guangzhou port and the shanghai port in the form of sparse packaging will be changed completely .
during the early days , a 5000 ton class container dock had already been built in jiujiang port in the north of jiangxi . the nanchang port became another " access to the sea " in jiangxi besides the jiujiang port .
according to presentations by responsible officials of this port , the international container terminal of jiujiang port to the north of jiangxi had an area of over 4700 square meters , and 128 standard containers can be hoisted each day , with an annual handling capacity of about 30,000 .
it ended the history of nanchang port not loading or unloading international containers .
persons concerned analyzed that , accelerating the construction of ports handling river cargo was another symbol of the further improvement of location advantages in jiangxi province after the beijing - kowloon railroad opened up to traffic .
the third main artery of china connecting the south and the north , the beijing - kowloon railroad , was completed successfully in 1995 . jiangxi , where one third of the route passes through , has become the province that has benefited the most .
at present , five train lines namely the zhejiang - jiangxi , the yingtan - xiamen , the anhui - jiangxi , the beijing - kowloon and the wuhan - jiujiang , and eleven train lines crisscross across the province .
nanchang has emerged from a closed land of the past to become the new inland traffic center .
constructing international container ports has become the inevitable trend of economy development . the media reported that , in the coastal region , the number of international container docks in the three places namely jiangsu , zhejiang and shanghai alone , had already reached more than twenty .

an official from china 's petroleum and natural gas corporation , when being interviewed recently by a reporter from this news agency , said that china will further accelerate prospecting and development natural gas resources of the sichuan basin to increase backup reserves and output , and is preparing to fully utilize natural gas resources , and to develop the natural gas and chemical industry .
currently , the natural gas resources found along the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river are mainly distributed in sichuan province , the chongqing municipality and the northwestern area of hubei province , among which sichuan province and the chongqing municipality 's natural gas resources are the richest . oil exploration area has reached 180,000 square kilometers , with a total resource magnitude of 7 trillion cubic meters .
by the end of 1997 , the totally explored reserves were 510 billion cubic meters , among which the chongqing area had 260 billion cubic meters , and a total of 86 gas fields were achieved .
in recent years , china has been paying close attention to development of the natural gas industry , and has drafted a development strategy for the land - based petroleum industry of " stabilizing the east , developing the west , and increasing oil and gas " .
in the sichuan basin alone , the richest of china 's three great land - based natural gas reserves , an accumulated amount of 163.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas has been produced in the past 40 - odd years . the production has basically satisfied the needs for household fuels of a number of large and middle - sized cities such as chengdu , chongqing , etc. and has resulted in china 's largest vinylon production line with natural gas as its raw material - the sichuan vinylon factory .
natural gas has become the most important raw material resource for energy and chemicals in sichuan province , chongqing municipality and areas of southwest china .
during the " ninth five - year - plan " period -lrb- 1996 - 2000 -rrb- , sichuan basin 's natural gas annual production capacity will reach more than 10 billion cubic meters , among which 5 billion will be from the chongqing region . recently added natural gas of more than 3 billion cubic meters will be mainly in chongqing .
administrator binggang zhu said that china petroleum and natural gas corporation will utilize this recently added capacity to develop natural gas chemical industry in the recently approved municipality of chongqing which has a solid industry foundation .
he said that china petroleum and natural gas corporation will build a new large - scale fertilizer factory in chongqing with an annual production scale of 450,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 800,000 tons of urea at an annual gas consumption of 500 million cubic meters . the total investment is 3.82 billion yuan , among which 1 billion is self - raised capital . the construction period is 3 to 4 years .
relevant experts believe that this project is very advantageous no matter whether you are talking about market demand for fertilizer in the chongqing area , or the reasonable utilization of natural gas resources , or the economic benefits of enterprises are concerned .
moreover , this corporation is also planning to construct an ethylene factory with natural gas as its raw material through co-operating with foreign companies , and will annually produce 300,000 tons of ethylene . this project has invested around 6 billion yuan rmb , and upon completion , will change the state of transferring almost all the needed chemical raw materials from other places to the areas of chongqing and sichuan .
binggang zhu said that during the " ninth five - year - plan " period , the total investment of china petroleum and natural gas corporation in oil and gas prospecting to develop the upper reaches of the yangtze river will reach 10 billion yuan in the area of chongqing .
after approval of the natural gas chemical industry project , more than 10 billion yuan will be further invested in construction .
this is more than the sum invested in the past 40 years .
he said that while the gas consumption of sichuan province and chongqing municipality is guaranteed , the project also takes into consideration the co-ordination with the construction of the three gorges project , which has attracted world - wide attention . it can transport part of the gas commodity to other provinces and cities , and will gradually connect with china 's other natural gas pipes to form a national natural gas pipe network .

china 's pharmaceutical enterprises , which mainly produce large amount of medicines used as raw materials and imitate foreign chemical medicines over a long period of time , will accelerate the development of new medicines and technologies with their own intellectual property rights .
an official from the state pharmaceutical administration bureau said that , starting this year , financial aid for the research of innovative medicines will be further increased , and state - owned funds would give investment priority to the fields of high technology and innovated medical products .
this year , the state pharmaceutical administration bureau will evaluate and decide the top 50 enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry according to new criteria . total annual sales revenue is predicted to be more than 60 % of the whole country 's medicine sales revenue .
at the same time , 3 - 5 % of each enterprise 's annual sales revenue will be used for the research and development of new medicines .
this official said that , at the same time , the state should also guide foreign capital to invest in new technologies , new products and medicine projects in the midwest area , to give impetus to national medicine enterprises to improve products ' technical content and enhance competitiveness in the international market .
china now has about 3,500 pharmaceutical enterprises , which produce 1,350 kinds of medicines used as raw materials and 4,000 kinds of chinese herbal medicines each year , and is the second largest producing and exporting country of medicines used as raw materials , second only to america .
but due to science and technology content being low , the product 's sales price on the international market is 20 - 30 % lower than the normal price , and can only return more than 1 billion us dollars in foreign currency each year .
while in 1996 , importing pharmaceutical preparations alone consumed funds surpassing 1.1 billion us dollars in china .
now , in china , there are less than 3,000 full time personnel engaging in the research of innovated medicines , only corresponding to personnel on the regular payroll of the research department of merck pharmaceutical company of the us .
experts urge that china 's pharmaceutical industry should change methods of focusing on the production of medicines used as raw materials , while paying less attention to development of preparations , and catching up with development trends of the global pharmaceutical industry as soon as possible .
it was learned that , the national project of new medicines and industrialized development , jointly promoted by departments of the state science commission , the ministry of public health , the state pharmaceutical administration bureau , etc. , is now being implemented . by the end of this century , ten new patent protected medicines are planned to be developed and five new medicine selecting centers , five medication safety assessing centers and five medication clinic experimentation centers will be built .

kazuo nakamura , director of research at japan 's dai - ichi kangyo bank , said here today that the real growth rate of the world economy in 1998 will be about 3 % .
kazuo nakamura , at a public lecture jointly organized by beijing 's wu jia economic consulting company , ltd. and japan 's dai - ichi kangyo bank , made a report concerning the new year 's world economic and financial situation .
after he reviewed the world economic and financial situation of '97 , he said that due to the economic growth in asia , including japan , further slowing down , the economic growth of america , even though its current economic activity is relatively good , and of other countries will also feel a very large effect .
compared with the rapid growth of the past , the world economy has entered a period of adjustment .
he forecast that the real growth rate for the world economy this year would fall from the 3.9 % of '97 down to 3 % .
nakamura thought that the rate of economic growth of asia 's countries and regions , with korea and thailand being the most prominent , would slide downward to a large extent .
but , he said , for these countries the currencies already have devalued to a great degree , exports have recovered , and imports could decrease .
because of this , he expected that their economies would slip downward to the lowest point in the next half year .
he estimated that the rate of economic growth in asean would be about 4.5 percent .
nakamura said that the japanese economy exhibited negative growth in the year '97 , and that in '98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
he estimated it would be negative 0.5 percent , plus or minus .
he said further that china 's economic growth would also slow in speed , feeling the effects of the economies of japan and asia being depressed and of the devaluation of these countries ' currencies .
but because china 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over 100 billion us dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other asian nations .

at the recently convened " debt and capital market forum " , vice director of the china national foreign exchange management bureau , xiaoling wu , expressed that the chinese government will not give up the policy of reform and opening up or suspend the foreign capital financing business because of the asian economic crisis .
he said , on the contrary , that china , under the premise of strengthening its financial risk prevention and control , will increase capital utilization benefits and support developing state - owned enterprise as targets , adhere to not changing reforms utilizing foreign capital , and at the same time will suitably re-adjust and perfect the policies of utilizing foreign capital .
according to reports by the " people 's daily " , xiaoling wu said this year will be an unforgettable year in the history of asian economic development .
the financial crisis in southeast asia and east asia undoubtedly will have greater impact on asia 's economic development .
although china 's economy and china 's financial system were not directly impacted , currently , the rmb exchange rate is stable , the economy still grew rapidly and healthily according to the development plan , and the inflation rate was controlled at a relatively low level .
but , asia 's financial crisis will produce definite negative effects on china 's economy and use of foreign capital .
we will further deepen financial system reform , strengthen the degree of financial supervision and management , and limit financial risk , to reduce the detrimental effects created by asia 's financial crisis on us to the lowest degree .
xiaoling wu also revealed that , henceforth , in the area of overseas debt issuance , we will implement policy re-adjustments and improvements in three areas .
first , debt issuance bodies will diversify .
besides insisting that financial institutions be the main foreign financing channels , there will be a few special large - scale state - owned enterprises with good international reputations , with high standards of multinational operations , that have good asset - to - debt ratios , and good benefits , that enter the international capital market to implement debt issuance .
second , bond structures will diversify .
after three years of experimentation , issuance methods and features of transferable bonds are accepted domestically . henceforth , the main lending bodies will optimize financing structures according to their characteristics and market demand , in making choices in areas such as transferrable bonds , bonds and bank loans , and will systematically develop issuance of project financing bonds , abs , etc. , that have no recall or limited recall rights , thereby reducing the pressure of financial institutions in foreign lending and promoting project management to become international , to become scientific , and to become transparent .
in short , we will actively utilize every type of financing method with international benefits , reduce costs of our overall financing and reduce our financial risks .
third , we will confirm the qualifications of overseas issuance bodies , completing the transition process from " window management " to credit assessment management of debt issuance bodies , and establish a scientific , transparent system of credit assessment management .
xiaoling wu also revealed that up to now , china 's domestic institutions have cumulatively issued us dollar equivalent foreign currency debts of about 17 billion us dollars on the international capital market , forcefully supporting the rapid , continuous and healthy development of the country 's economy .

this year , shandong province began to implement the policy of employee housing monetization allocation within the bounds of the entire province , meaning that city and township employees can no longer get housing from the work unit they work for like before .
henceforth , using money to buy a living place or using rent to rent housing will become the new mechanism .
shandong is currently the first province to implement the policy of housing monetization allocation in china .
moreover , provinces and cities such as guangdong , shanghai , etc. are also implementing this kind of experimental work in housing allocation system reform .
the state ministry of finance and the state housing reform office granted full recognition to this .
at the end of last year , china , at a series of meetings , pointed out that one of the key tasks of the 1998 reform is to accelerate housing system reform , to accelerate the process of transforming housing from a material allocation to a monetary allocation , and to establish a new method to monetize benefit allocations .
in the past few decades , although housing was always a top matter of expense for china 's countryside residents , but in the cities and towns , however , housing was treated as an employee benefit , freely allocated by work units , and only needing extremely low rent to be submitted every month .
in 1994 , after the " state council 's decision to deepen city and township housing system reform " was announced , city and township employee housing started to take steps in the direction of threefold common responsibility , namely the state , the collective and the individual .
an obvious sign of this is the housing accumulation fund system starting to be commonly established .
according to what was revealed at the working forum on housing reform work in some provinces and cities held in beijing recently , currently the total amount of national accumulation funds surpassed 80 billion yuan . this huge accumulation fund is playing an increasingly obvious role in supporting individuals to purchase housing and housing construction .
at the same time , there has been a big increase in the nation 's monthly rent of public housing in cities and townships , with some regions increasing to account for about 10 % of the income of dual income families .
although the pace of housing reform is being accelerated , the old method of allocating housing through benefits has still has not been broken through .
according to a recent survey conducted among residents of 5 cities , namely beijing , shanghai , tianjin , chongqing and guangzhou , relying on work units to allocate housing still remains the main avenue of residential housing in these 5 cities .
in shanghai , 62.4 % of the residents currently still have housing still under work unit allocation .
yunfa zhu and yanqun zhang , economic scholars of china 's social science institute , said : " monetizing housing allocation is a large trend " .
its central content is to abolish benefit housing allocation , and at the same time to increase housing expense amounts in employee salaries .
director of the city and township construction committee , junmin wang , who is in charge of the housing reform work of shandong province , believes that although the aim of housing reform is to realize " residents have their own houses " and housing commercialization , yet considering government financial strength , the condition of enterprise operations , and the level of employee incomes , at present , still only selling houses and renting houses at cost can be put into practice .
junmin wang said that if the money from employees paying rent is used to pay a mortgage , with housing subsidies and the housing accumulation fund , a dual income family purchasing a 75 square - meter , 2 bedroom , economy apartment , according to the 1996 cost price , will need 12 years .
if loans such as mortgages , guarantees and installments , etc. , are also utilized to pay , employees can definitely afford it .
if a one - time housing subsidy is also used , the economic environment of employees buying houses will be eased even more .
it was learned that china currently has about 66 million square meters of commercial housing overstocked . financial departments have been requested to develop employee personal housing mortgage and loan business to increase their purchasing ability .
last year , the size of the china construction bank and the industrial and commerce bank 's personal housing mortgages and loans increased to 10 billion yuan .
concerned departments also cancelled some fee items so as to lower housing construction costs .
when analyzing and forecasting this year 's economy , beijing economists recently said that accelerating starting the city and township housing expenses will possibly cause the housing industry to become a new growth point of the domestic economy in 1998 .

the white paper , " regarding the china - us balance of trade problem " , announced by china 's state department news office today , pointed out that the unreasonableness of trade statistics determined according to the original site of manufacture principle was where the essence lay in america 's trade deficit with china being seriously exaggerated , and in the sino - american trade balance situation being distorted .
the white paper said that because of a lack of unified original production site rules , each country , when formulating its own original production site rule , often starts out from the needs of its own country , and standards differ , degrees of strictness vary , and randomness sometimes exists in assessing the original production site of imported goods .
the white paper said that now , because economic trade relationships among countries in the world develop rapidly , cross-national investments increase daily , exchanges in international trade are no longer goods produced in an individual country , but " world products " crossing national boundaries .
methods of calculating export trade according to current original production sites , make it obviously difficult to accurately reflect general trends in changes in world economic development . it could even distort the balance of trade situation among countries .
in the past two to three decades , rapid development in the processing trade in some countries and regions had increased the complexity of this problem .
the white paper said , since the 90's , one of the important ingredients of the growth of china 's foreign trade exports was the expansion of processing trade exports .
china 's processing trade was mainly developed from the transfer of labor - intensive manufacturing industries or work processes from developed countries such as the us , japan , etc. and countries and regions such as singapore , korea , hong kong , taiwan , etc. , in order to reduce production costs and raise competitiveness .
its products rely on original sales channels , transferring from places like hong kong , etc. to traditional markets such as the us etc .
by original production site rule statistics , product exporting countries shifted from these countries and regions to china .
the white paper said that in recent years , two thirds of china 's exports to the us were transferred out through the hong kong region .
these products ' value - added rates in hong kong are far higher than the value - added rates in mainland china . hong kong 's actual benefits are far higher than mainland china .
if hong kong 's larger value - added portions are counted as hong kong 's exports , then china 's trade surplus with the us could correspondingly decrease , even becoming a deficit .
the white paper thereby drew the conclusion and held that , when using original production site statistics , its limitations must be fully recognized , superficial figures must be seen through , and the actual benefit that each party achieves from trade must be seriously analyzed .
this will then help to eliminate misunderstanding , and appropriately solve trade disputes between countries .
at the same time , one must also consider the increasingly growing trend of increasingly close international economic interaction and international investment , service trade , etc. , improve and perfect trade statistical methods , make statistical data objective and realistic , create good conditions for mutually beneficial co-operation among various countries of the world and healthy development of world economic trade .

yuan chen , vice president of the people 's bank of china , delivered a written speech at the 48th meeting of the temporary committee of the international monetary fund organization here on the 28th . he called for all countries in the world to strengthen co-operation and to promote the continuous development of the world economy .
he said that in 1996 world economic growth had some acceleration , that the pressure of global inflation was further reduced , and that the level of world economy integration significantly increased .
but the long - term continuous development of the world economy still faces quite a lot of macro-economic imbalance factors and structural obstacles . apart from each country 's efforts to mainly depend on itself , strengthening international co-operation will help to eliminate stumbling factors in the growth of the world economy .
he pointed out that in some european industrial countries current economy lagging is mainly due to structural obstacles such as over - burdened social welfare systems and the ossification of labor markets that have been existing for a long time , etc .
accelerating the pace of structural reform will not only be beneficial to promoting the economic recovery of these countries and the development of the european economy and currency union , but will also have active effects on the continuous growth of the world economy . other industrial countries should also make use of the present opportunity while the economic situation is still good to reduce budget deficits and increase the dynamics of structural reform .
yuan chen believed that because most of the developing countries are actively promoting structural reform and adopting measures to stabilize their economy , these countries as a unified body have maintained a growth rate of above 6 % for 5 years running .
moreover , they have good prospects to continue to maintain such a strong growth trend .
the contribution of developing countries to the development of the world economy is increasingly large . the degree of contact with one another and with other countries in the world is increasing , and the disparities in economic growth between regions appear to be on a narrowing trend .
at the same time yuan chen emphasized that economic development among the developing countries is still not even . the economy in many countries is still very fragile . their debts are still heavy and the poverty situation is worsening . in the spirit of development and co-operation , the international community should adopt realistic and feasible measures to help these developing countries solve these problems .
he said that in recent years the signs of globalization of the world economy are becoming more and more obvious , and that the world economy has been greatly pushed towards prosperity .
the unification of the world economy is intensifying with each passing day . facing the challenges brought by globalization , each country should continuously implement sound economic policies and deepen structural reform so as to enjoy the most benefits from the process of globalization and to minimize the negative effects .
yuan chen also pointed out that what causes worry is that some industrial countries take labor standards , environment and human rights , etc. , as excuses to frequently adopt trade protection measures . this severely affects the future of world economy and trade .
on the other hand , there are still a number of developing countries that have not benefited from the progress of globalization .
in this connection , he appealed to the industrial countries to eliminate obstacles to the progress of the globalization of the world economy as soon as possible .
in concluding his speech , yuan chen said that there are only 64 days left for china to regain the right to exercise sovereignty over hong kong . the preparatory work for handing over and taking over is near completion , and preparatory organization of the government of the hong kong special administrative region is basically ready . the confidence of the people of hong kong and the international community in the future of hong kong has increased . the prosperous development of the economy in china 's mainland will enable continuous provision of strong shield - like support for the prosperity of the hong kong economy .
on behalf of the chinese government he welcomed the participants to hong kong , china , in september of this year to attend the next meeting and the 1997 annual meeting of the temporary committee of the international monetary fund organization .

according to what has been reported in the soviet " science and life " magazine , biologists in moscow have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
this method will not pollute the environment .
biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
this kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
when mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .

on december 26th of last year , the " hubei daily " released a group of articles , naming and criticizing a comrade at a village broadcasting station for fabricating a news release , " guofu ba hits a roadblock " . it also released an editorial article pointing out that sticking to principles of authenticity in news reporting is an excellent tradition in party journalism .
similar false and partially false news items have been seen not only in the " hubei daily " , but also other newspapers , tv and radio have had such news .
although false news is rare , the influence is extremely bad .
if there is one false piece of news out of 100 pieces , readers will suspect the other 99 pieces .
the chinese communist party is a party that maintains the principle of being practical and realistic . party journalism should also follow the principle of being practical and realistic .
regardless of whether you are a professional journalist or an amateur , regardless of whether reporting good news or reporting bad news , all of it needs to be true .
there are a lot of reasons for causing news to be inconsistent with facts , most are subjective reasons .
the " hubei daily " published that comrade 's self - criticism . he said , " in order to get a good appraisal at the end of the year , i changed the time and place of incidents which happened or i had witnessed in the past , and fudged such scenarios as ' the director general of revenue insists on giving guofu ba a reward of 50 yuan ' and ' guofu ba 's child was ill and needed money urgently ' , etc . "
his desire for being appraised well is understandable , but should have taken the right road .
moreover , press organizations should strictly check , and especially look out for those " related articles " .
so , to punish false news , some practical measures must be taken , exposing it in the papers is very effective .
false news can fool readers for a period of time , but eventually the writers fool themselves .
to welcome the illuminating 70th anniversary of the birth of the chinese communist party , essays solicited on " on the position of party branch secretary " meet with readers today .
the opening page wrote about the party branch secretary of jiujianpeng village of pingyi county of shandong province .
this village is situated on top of a high mountain , from the origin of the name of the village , one can imagine the bad natural conditions and the difficult life of the masses .
in the past , when people from below the mountain came to visit relatives in this village , the best gift to bring was a can of water .
after several years of diligent struggle , this place has changed appearance .
electric lamps light up the village , wide roads are built on steep cliffs , deserted mountains have turned green , fruit is in abundance .
the key to this change happening is there is a good party branch who leads the masses to cure poverty and make wealth . there is jiakun liu who was accredited as an " excellent member of the communist party " of the province and a " labor model of the entire country " , acting as the party branch secretary .
he works for the masses and firstly , is not afraid of suffering loss , secondly , is not afraid of hardship , and thirdly , is not afraid of being blamed .
these " three do not fears " are a demonstration of the spirit of communism .
the grassroots organization of the party is the fighting fortress of the party among society 's grassroots organizations , is a political kernel for uniting the vast masses to fight for the thorough implementation of lines , guidelines , and policies of the party .
party branches have a lot of work to do . the branch secretary , being the leading person , must possess multi-faceted talents , but most importantly must have the communist spirit of serving the people in his heart and soul .
with this spirit , the party organization will be able to plant roots among the masses , will be able to lead the masses to overcome all types of difficulties , move mountains to fill seas , work well in areas such as agriculture , industry , commerce , education according to policies and decrees of the party and the nation , lead soldiers well , be a good cadre , and make contributions to the socialist modernization undertaking .
the purpose of this newspaper opening this special column is to spread this type of utterly valuable spirit , introduce working experience of party branch secretaries , and contribute a portion of strength for promoting the construction of grassroots organizations of the party .

the art of calligraphy is a special kind of art form in china . each period has its own superior achievements , which combine to make a brilliant and glorious calligraphy history .
this is exactly why the chinese art of calligraphy wins the strong admiration of friends from many countries of the world .
american friends mr. sackler and his wife , have wholeheartedly contributed a lot to carrying forward our art of calligraphy , and hope to introduce this brilliant art to the world , to let more friends learn and treasure it .
we appreciate their absolute sincerity .
the first recently held " sackler cup calligraphy competition " selected , recommended and widely solicited calligraphy works and treasures of recently budding calligraphers scattered in various places , and has been deeply welcomed by readers .
in the appraisal and selection process , the standards we emphasized were : conforming to classical requirements of the chinese art of calligraphy ; healthy language diction , readable handwriting ; certain standards of writing methods ; solid skills , and self - establishing a new artistic concept -- these are the characteristics of our chinese art of calligraphy , and because we have these characteristics , we won the attention of foreign friends .
therefore , any work that can follow tradition but not stagnate , and have new artistic concepts will be appraised well .
in a serious yet harmonious discussion , the judges thinking achieved unity and decided this round 's outstanding entries .
one kind of situation embarrassed the judges , namely , that some works displayed really beautifully written characters , conformed to a certain calligraphy style , and showed signs of new achievement in art form , but regretfully , because the calligraphers have poor basic knowledge , they wrote some wrong characters , and since there was no remedy , finally lost in the selection .
everyone both felt pity for them , and felt that this is an issue very worth worrying about .
some young calligraphy lovers , just at the time when they should have been studying hard , were hindered . so basic knowledge was not enough , structure was not systematic , and the level was rather low . they have some ability in calligraphy , but eventually can not produce a final masterpiece at a higher level , and can not create works which may be used as teaching models .
we sincerely hope that these friends will amend this aspect quickly , and hope future works will show both superior capability in calligraphy , and convey healthy and deep thoughts , and even reveal a clear , meaningful and elegant mind .
this is the eager expectation that many older - generation calligraphers have placed on us younger - generation .

at 3,776 meters above sea level , mount fuji does n't even reach one half way up mount qomolangma , but in this archipelago on the western rim of the pacific ocean , she is still the greatest of 1,000 peaks and a masterpiece of nature . this makes her stand out among the world 's innumerable volcanic remnants like a crane among chickens . no wonder that japanese people regard her as a gift of nature and call her " sacred mountain . "
it just so happened that the annual meeting of the international germanic language and literature association that is held every five years was held in tokyo this year . this allowed this writer to get a glance at fuji 's charisma and to be able to settle realizing an " inordinate ambition " of many years .
mount fuji is only 80 kilometers from tokyo -- this obviously was also specially arranged by good fortune : this island nation 's highest mountain and her largest city depend on one another as partners and mutually reflect one another .
thereupon , like a light boat on a familiar route , the large tour bus that we rode raced directly toward the southwest -- the direction of mount fuji .
without anyone being aware of it , the dense forest almost completely sealed the road off from the sky above .
it turned out that the road had already narrowed , moreover it was sloping . one look out the window was enough for one to know that the bus was already suspended half way up the mountain !
in just a little bit , at a small patch of open terrain , the tour guide --- a woman with mastery of five european languages -- ordered the bus to stop . she let everyone hasten to view and enjoy the sacred mountain 's countenance , taking advantage of an opportune moment of the sun revealing his smiling face and extending his greeting to us .
i raised my head in expectation . holy cow ! it was at least still more than 1,000 meters in height and the precipitous slope was n't under 60 plus degrees . nearby there was a level slope a few hundred meters wide amidst rows of green trees and withered trees , exposing raked brown - grey gravel . this apparently was the remains of the volcanic ash from the most recent eruption in 1707 .
the tour guide was urging everyone to board the bus .
i asked her : how long would it take to climb to the summit from here on foot ?
she replied proclaiming : four to seven hours !
i extended my tongue and raised my head , imagining and hoping for a glance at the summit , but only saw clouds wafting in the air .
i saw no lofty mountain peak . the large tour bus started up again and i thought , this time we have to be going straight to fuji 's " ears . " suddenly a sound broke my train of thought : " it 's not right , old ye , how can this bus go straight down ? " --- that was one of my chinese colleagues .
thereupon , i agitatedly got up and asked the tour guide : " why are we going back after only just getting half way up the mountain ? "
she said : " touring mount fuji does n't at all imply mountain climbing .
what 's more , fuji 's scenery is not all concentrated at the summit y' know . the scenic spots at the foot of the mountain are plentiful ! "
so evidently the bus really was carrying us down the mountain ! that being the case , i lost no time in again catching an eyeful of fuji 's peak --- i practically glued my eyes to the glass of the bus window , facing the rear in hope .
by coincidence , just while looking at the ever - changing clouds , they were fortuitously located at the summit , and resembling cotton , they tore open a hole as if deliberately allowing the " sacred " one 's forehead to venture out , as if seeing me off and also as if laughing at me .
for an instant , a sigh of regret for " great aspirations difficult to fulfill " overwhelmed me !
because i 'd already come across a face that resembled an old man of lofty mountains many times !
at a spacious and luxurious restaurant at the foot of fuji we ate a definitely not sumptuous western meal .
everyone hurriedly cast aside cups and plates , then without leave went nearby and viewed and enjoyed the famous first of " fuji 's five lakes , " lake kawaguchi , and the enchanting sights of its surroundings .
at this time the weather got overcast and the water of the lake was still like a mirror , causing people to think of our country 's jiuzhaigou 's mirror lake , and with the result that it had a kind of special , mysterious flavor .
in the middle of the lake , besides a couple of slowly moving pleasure boats , there was also the reflection of a group of hills , rising and falling . it was especially the reflection of the " sacred mountain " that most caused people to express wonder . the luxurious growth by the shore seemed exactly like her emerald necklace .
in the forest the crow 's calls accompanied the happy appearance of the flowers ... ... yet this place still did n't hold us so enthralled by the scenery as to forget to go home . after some hours we then arrived at the famous hakone scenic area that together with fuji belongs to izu park .
the volcano 's wonders appeared prominently before our eyes . the " fire " had already been dormant for 400,000 years , yet vapors rising everywhere and crystal clear , boiling hot springs testified to her vitality and power .
even though the stink of sulfur filled the air in all directions , nevertheless , people still bravely competed in eating those eggs that had been cooked done and cooked black by the hot springs . amazing girls still extended tiny hands into the hot springs to test the temperature , but strangely cried out with sharp sounds on being scalded .
this was just " hakone 's seven scalds " -lrb- meaning the seven hot springs -rrb- whose name is known far and wide . it , along with the landscape of the impenetrable pass ancient road and one thousand streams waterfall , the nine headed dragon , the immortal 's stone field , as well as the numerous stone buddhas groups , etc. of " hakone 's eight li " , makes up a large tourist attraction . the mountain - climbing bus , the electric cable car , and the suspended cable car that shuttle back and forth make this whole group all visible to the eye below .
the volcano lake , seven kilometers in circumference , below not far away --- reed lake , forms a splendorous contrast with it .
i once had the thought that , relying on japan 's technology and economic strength she would be able to build a road to the summit or simply put up a cable car , that the reason that she has buses come to make a sharp turnabout at 2,400 meters above sea level just possibly is in order to leave you with a certain degree of difficulty or " uncertain " feeling , to put you into the state of having something within sight but beyond reach , to suspend your appetite for a long , long time .
because beauty really does n't lie in the time of the realization of a desire but lives profoundly in the yearning for the goal .
if i had ascended this dangerous peak that day then perhaps this " sacred mountain " then would lose her eternal enchantment .

" chrysanthemum - 6 " , a large scientific experiment satellite launched by japan , has no hope of entering geosynchronous orbit .
yutaka kawashima , chief of the science and technology department , while proclaiming this news of failure to numerous journalists today , expressed her profound regrets and apologized to the whole japanese people .
she said that " a huge amount in appropriations was spent for research and development on the satellite , yet it has become floatsam floating in the universe ; but we still hope that this satellite can be utilized to the largest extent . "
yutaka kawashima also suggested that the universe development undertaking group organize an inspection team to thoroughly ascertain the reason why the satellite could not enter geosynchronous orbit .
according to preliminary investigations by concerned parties , the cause of the failure was that the satellite 's apogee engine was unable to normally operate because of a breakdown in the fuel valve .
after the " chrysanthemum - 6 " satellite was sent into elliptical orbit by an " h2 - 2 " rocket on the afternoon of august 28th , it was originally planned to send it into geosynchronous orbit gradually by firing the satellite 's apogee engine 3 times , this interval requiring around 1 month 's time .
however , the japanese universe development undertaking group , which took responsibility for the launch , continued to remotely control the satellite on august 30th and 31st many times but suffered repeated failures .
the " chrysanthemum - 6 " satellite , weighing 2 tons and with a 30 - meter - long board of solar powered batteries , is the biggest satellite ever launched by japan so far .
moreover , this satellite is equipped with necessary electrical machinery and sensors . japan originally planned to use it to conduct the world 's first multimedia communication experiments , such as optical communication , etc .
the japanese universe development undertaking group believed that if this satellite 's experiment was successful , japan would henceforth enter an age of using large satellites like advanced countries in europe and america .
therefore , a sum of 41.5 billion yen was put into the development of this satellite .
this time completely and greatly delayed japan 's universe development undertaking process , and many programs need to be changed .

according to " china securities news " reporting , the 65 billion financial bonds issued this year by the national development bank , are not within the scope of this year 's domestic securities issuance plan , moreover , they are brought into this year 's credit scope of specialized banks , and also included in the fixed capital investment plan drafted by the state planning commission .
this part of the funds will come entirely from national financial institutions , and financial bonds will not be issued to the public .
according to presentations , after its founding , the national development bank transferred the portion of funds used for the construction of infrastructure and technical innovation projects from the specialized banks to its own account in the form of financial bonds . therefore , there is no change in the total amount of fixed capital assets investment .
but , the capital for specialized banks to purchase financial bonds comes from savings deposits , not new growth , and has utterly no effect on either the issuance of government bonds or the issuance of new shares .
it was learned that after this year 's 65 billion financial bonds are in possession , there will be 60 billion in funds to be used for 345 large and medium - sized infrastructure projects and 5 billion will be used for important policy - related technical innovation projects .
according to presentations , as a financial policy institution , the national development bank will mainly assist national pillar industries , and support the government in carrying out macro-economic management . it does not have any source of funds of its own , and is not for profit .
the development bank has many capital sources and channels . firstly , it has registered capital of 50 billion yuan allocated from national finance . secondly , it issues bonds to financial institutions . thirdly , it issues bonds abroad to attract foreign capital or borrows from foreign commercial banks . the fourth is people 's bank funding .
in the future , it might also issue bonds to the public , but the amount will be very small .
it is reported that according to the " national development bank 's plan for structuring and operation " approved by the state council , such fund appropriations as national development bank policy loans , etc. have already been entrusted to the people 's construction bank of china and a signing ceremony was held recently in beijing .
after bilateral consultation , the national development bank entrusted the construction bank to supervise loan contract executions , to process business such as loans and fund appropriations , etc. , to supervise loan utilization , and to assist in bettering loan recovery work .

president zemin jiang will soon be visiting russia , the ukraine and france .
recently , he was respectively interviewed by reporters from russia and france at the fangfei garden of the diaoyutai state guest house , and answered questions on the sino - russian , sino - french relations , and regional , international issues .
when a reporter asked about the present situation of sino - russian relations and the prospects of co-operation , president zemin jiang said that relations between the countries of china and russia have been developing smoothly in the areas of politics , economy and trade , science and technology , education , culture , etc. , in the past 3 years , especially after president yeltsin 's visit to china at the end of 1992 .
both countries have maintained high level contact and relations ; negotiations on border divisions have achieved important results and significant progress has been made in disarmament negotiations at the border regions .
trade volume has exceeded the highest historical levels of sino - russian trade for two years running . china and russia have become important mutual trade partners .
he said that " the two countries of china and russia are close neighbors . i think that the people of the two countries , namely china and russia are happy about the development of relations between the two countries . "
zemin jiang said to russian reporters : " at the invitation of president yeltsin , i will be visiting your beautiful country in two days .
together with president yeltsin and other russian leaders , i will explore establishing friendly , neighborly and mutual , co-operative sino - russian relations that will extend into the 21st century so as to raise the co-operation of the two countries in various areas to a new level . "
when a reporter asked whether the fact that now a large number of chinese citizens overstay short - term visas after entering russia will become a factor in tense relations between china and russia and how this problem should be solved , zemin jiang expressed that with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between china and russia in recent years , the two countries are no longer isolated from each other , and relations between them have expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts . this process is very natural .
he said that " because necessary legislation and measures can not keep up with demands of the situation and development , certain phenomena of disorder occur , especially in contact at the border regions , resulting in some passive influences .
we hold that this type of situation is not good and should be improved and stopped .
in recent days , the situation has improved to a certain extent because both sides have co-operated in the adoption of some measures . "
zemin jiang said that " we should not ' stop eating because of a hiccup ' .
i hold that this is a problem that appears while relations between the two countries are being developed , and that if both china and russia take sincere , friendly , calm and realistic attitudes towards a joint effort , these problems can be solved appropriately , and that they are not , nor can they be factors of tense sino - russian relations . "
speaking of the reason for the decrease in the volume of trade between china and russia so far this year , zemin jiang said that " we have noticed that compared to the same period last year , there is a drop in the volume of trade between the two countries , china and russia , in the first half of this year .
the reasons for the drop are manifold : both china and russia are implementing economic reforms , and there are changes in demands for each other 's goods ; changes in the visa system have also brought some effects in contacts between traders of both sides .
in international trade , increases and decreases in trade volume happen frequently .
i believe that the drop in the volume of trade between china and russia is only a temporary phenomenon .
through joint efforts of both sides in encouraging large , powerful and reputable companies from each country to develop co-operation , trade between both countries will develop even more healthily .
there is no doubt that issues in this area will be within the scope of talks between the leaders of both countries . "
when interviewed by french reporters , zemin jiang said that " the situation in the development of relations between china and france has been very good since their normalization this year .
prime minister barisque visited china in april , and now at the invitation of president mitterrand i will be carrying out a visit to france for national affairs .
trade relations between the two countries have also more quickly reached normalization and development .
in the first half of this year , french exports to china increased by 42.2 % compared with the same period last year . "
zemin jiang pointed out that china and france are strongly complementary to each other in economy , and that development prospects are good .
both sides have quite a lot of identical or similar viewpoints on international issues .
he said that " i believe that as long as both sides make joint efforts , friendly co-operative relations between the two countries will definitely continue to develop on the principles of the sino - french communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations and the joint communique issued on january 12th this year . "
when reporters asked about north korea 's nuclear issue and china 's role , zemin jiang emphasized that there are two goals china is seeking on this issue : to maintain the peace and stability of the korean peninsula and to realize a non-nuclear region in the korean peninsula .
he said that " china has always advocated resolution through direct talks between relevant sides .
we welcome the preliminary results achieved by the talks between the us and north korea , and have been playing an active role . "
when answering the question on whether china 's government is hoping for contact with each country in europe , or wants to have contact with the european union , zemin jiang said that " china is willing to have contact with each country in europe and also develop friendly co-operative relations with the european union . i think that these two are mutually exclusive . "
when a reporter asked to what level contacts with taiwan could be extended by a country that maintains diplomatic relations with china , zemin jiang emphasized that all countries that have established diplomatic relations with china have expressed their admission that the people 's republic of china is the only legal government representing all of china , and that taiwan is an inseparable part of china .
they promised not to establish official relations or have contact with taiwan that is of an official nature .
he said that we have no objections to economic and trade relations kept between france and taiwan that are purely people - to - people . -lrb- end -rrb-
xinhua news agency , beijing , april 23rd
today , the association of the relationship between the two sides of the straits sent a letter to the foundation for the exchange across the straits to exchange views on the matters of life and property loss of mainland compatriots and taiwanese compatriots .
the communique said that on april 12th the straits association director expressed that the straits association agreed in principle , after both sides implement necessary preparations , to exchange views about the matter of contact and exchange between both sides of the straits concerning life and property loss of mainland compatriots and taiwanese compatriots in recent years .
the straits association holds that , now , both sides should first agree on topics and content of exchanging views , and then come back to consider issues such as staff levels and time , place , etc .
if both sides can not reach an agreement on topics and content , it would not be possible to find common points in exchanging views . this type of discussion is not what compatriots from both sides are happy to see .
the straits association believes that the content of the exchange of views should include :
firstly , to exchange views on the issues of tourism and contact on both sides of the straits , including travel safety issues of compatriots from both sides .
as early as the first working discussion , at the end of august of last year , when the two associations implemented the " wang - gu talks " , the straits association put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of the wang - gu talks " that the associations should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on both sides " as soon as possible , but so far the straits foundation 's response has not been received .
secondly , the straits association persistently advocates completely implementing discussions of topics about routine and economy , science and technology stipulated in the " common agreement of the wang - gu talks " , and has suggested many times to the straits foundation that discussions on the " rights of taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " should be started early .
our association holds that the personal and property safety of taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland have legal safeguards , and if the straits foundation felt it was needed , it could exchange views while discussing " rights of taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " .
thirdly , the straits association has repeatedly requested that both associations should conduct consultative discussions on issues of the taiwanese military killing and wounding mainland coastal fishermen and causing serious life and property losses in recent years .
since establishing the straits association , it has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to the straits foundation which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of both sides and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on both sides , so as to attract the attention of relevant taiwanese areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants .
it has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between the two associations .
however , up to now , the straits foundation 's response has not been received .
the communique clearly points out that in the above issues involving rights of compatriots of both sides of the straits in contact and exchange , personal safety is included , so as for the long delay in starting discussions , the fault is not with the straits association . the communique says that current methods of contact and co-operation between the two associations must strictly follow the " regulation agreement of contact and talks between the two associations " signed last year .
since the " qiandao lake incident " occurred , the straits association has , according to the agreement , reported the situation to the straits foundation , explaining and answering a certain number of questions and requests brought up by the straits foundation .
however , the straits foundation has repeatedly raised demands that exceed the above agreement of the two associations . despite being reminded by the straits association , the straits foundation still repeatedly persists .
this is a practice that disrespects the agreement between the two associations . it is continually hoped that the contact and co-operation of the two associations can be conducted in accordance with the current agreement .
the communique points out that as far as the " qiandao lake incident " is concerned , the top priority is investigating and settling the case in accordance with the law .
at the same time , to express further goodwill , the straits association has proactively invited the straits foundation and relevant experts to come to zhejiang .
the straits association will arrange experts ' to be presented with the details of the incident and reply to questions . if the straits foundation is willing to know the details of this case and sincerely understands the feelings of dependents of those who perished , then it is difficult to understand why it again sets up prerequisites ?
the straits association again reaffirms the above invitation , and hopes that the straits foundation would soon provide the date of its departure and the name list .
according to relevant sources , currently , the three suspected criminals have been arrested , and a trial will soon be carried out according to legal procedure .

key national laboratories , since being established ten years ago , have now become important bases for basic research in china .
their advanced apparatus and equipment , highly level scientific and technical staff and comprehensive dominance in scientific research have made important contributions to the promotion of construction of national key projects and the development of academic disciplines .
the establishment of key national laboratories , persisting in the principle of choosing the best to fit the need , is equipping a number of top - ranking domestic laboratories able to participate in competition at international forefronts to become basic research " national teams " able to represent the nation 's equipment levels , research levels , academic levels and management levels .
after many years ' of construction , key national laboratories have established a number of experimental research bases for basic research , involving not only the basic research fields and emerging sciences and technologies fields , but also in engineering projects closely related to national economic development .
for instance , key national laboratories in such areas as surface physics , superconductors , molecular biology , biotechnology , information systems , intelligence technology , geochemistry , materials science , etc. , have actually become important experimental research centers of china in these fields .
in the past 10 years , key national laboratories , in various ways , have also taken on a large quantity of national natural science fund projects , national climbing program projects , national science and technology brainstorming projects , " 863 " program projects , institutional co-operation projects , society entrusted projects , etc. , and have solved a series of significant problems of science and technology in national economic construction .
after the establishment and construction of key national laboratories , problems having international levels that were selected by utilizing various comprehensive advantages have greatly promoted the establishment of relevant disciplines in china .
one book " the foundation of mathematics and physics in numerical weather forecast " written by qingcun zeng , academician of the atmospheric science and geohydromechanics numerical simulation laboratory , is regarded internationally as a theoretical masterpiece in atmospheric science and has enriched and perfected theories on atmospheric science .
but the infrared physics laboratory has also played an active role in promoting the intersection and merging of physics with other discipline areas , and in expanding and reforming traditional physics research .

chinese scientists have successively discovered ten archaeopteryx - type fossils in the beipiao region of liaoxi this year .
this find has attracted attention from home and abroad , and has been called " one of the most important finds since archaeopteryx fossils were found in germany in 1862 " .
in 1862 at the earliest finding of archaeopteryx in the state of bavaria , germany , it stirred the whole world .
over the past 100 years , the world has discovered altogether 8 archaeopteryx findings from the same period , and only confined to this area .
however , the study of archaeopteryx has never stopped .
today , the archaeopteryx - type fossils china discovered are close to and similar in age , form and structure to germany 's archaeopteryx -- it was approximately 142.5 million years or more ago and belonged to the mesozoic oxfordian . they are a rich source of material . there are not only completely preserved skulls and wings but also waist belts , back limbs and several feathers .
experts and scholars from home and abroad are greatly focusing on this important discovery .
professor austern of yale university in the us , an authoritative scholar on the research issues of the origin of birds of the world , a few days ago , in his letter of congratulation to the ancient birds institute of the chinese academy of sciences , expressed intense interest .
relevant scholars in china 's geology circles said that this discovery has added new evidence to determining geological ages .
chinese ornithological experts , however , think that this important find has very important significance in the study of the origin of birds and ancient biology research . it not only adds a new member to the ancient birds but also widens the geographical distribution of the earliest birds , especially , puts forth a new challenge to today 's various hypotheses of the protracted debate on the origin of birds .
according to information , china , in recent years , has successively discovered bird fossils from the early mesozoic period in provinces such as gansu , hebei , inner mongolia , liaoning , etc . this period was mostly in the early cretaceous age .
however , this find of archaeopteryx fossils are from a much earlier age , lower in stratus and more primitive in features than previously discovered archaeopteryx .
in view of this , the world places hopes of tracing the more primitive and more ancient , true ancestor of birds in china , and chinese scientists also expressed possibly discovering fossils of birds earlier than the archaeopteryx in china .
according to another report , chinese scientists have temporarily named this type of archaeopteryx fossil " the divine land archaeopteryx " .
currently , they are performing further study on these fossils .

here , today , the zijin mountain astronomical observatory under china 's academy of science , issued the specific forecasted time to observe shoemaker - levy 9 comet 's collision with jupiter from china . this provides a rare opportunity for chinese astronomers and amateurs to observe this astronomic phenomenon of rare human experience .
the shoemaker - levy 9 comet , which was discovered by us astronomers in march 1993 , has now split into 21 nuclei and has been moving at high speed towards jupiter . it will collide with jupiter and explode in july .
this is the first forecast of a magnificent collision phenomenon between celestial bodies of the solar system in human history .
on the basis of international observations , forecast data , and many years of their own research observations and precise calculations concerning asteroids and comets , planet research experts at the zijin mountain astronomical observatory of nanjing recently forecasted the specific time for observing this astronomic phenomenon from china .
the first collision of this comet with jupiter will occur at 3:30 am , in the wee hours of july 17th , beijing time , and the serial number of the colliding nucleus is no. 21 . this collision will be unobservable in china . the first collision observable in china will occur at 2:30 pm on the 17th and the serial number of the nucleus is no. 19 . this collision is observable with a radio telescope . the first collision observable in the night sky of china will occur at 7:30 pm of the 17th and the serial number of the colliding nucleus is no. 18 . within 15 minutes after the collision , the collision area will start to face earth . astronomy amateurs can observe it with a suitable mini-type astronomical telescope . a more powerful collision is expected to occur at 10:30 that night , and the serial number of the nucleus is no. 17 .
the collision of the 21 comet nuclei will last for five and a half days .
according to astronomy experts of the zijin mountain astronomical observatory , the speed at the time of collision between the 21 nuclei and jupiter will be as high as 60 km / s .
among them , the diameters of the 11 larger nuclei range from 2 to 4 kilometers . the energy of the explosion at collision time will reach as high as 10 trillion tons of tnt dynamite , equivalent to the explosive power of 500 million atomic bombs similar to those dropped on hiroshima . a colossal fireball and soaring mushroom cloud may be formed in jupiter 's atmosphere whose projectiles would be thrown to a height of several thousand kilometers .
astronomers stressed that the collision between the comet and jupiter will be 770 to 780 million kilometers away from the earth , corresponding to 5 times the distance between the sun and the earth , and therefore will impose no direct impact on the earth .
according to astronomy experts , the observation and study of this comet colliding with jupiter will help both the in - depth revelation of jupiter 's mysteries of the rosy clouds , the great red spot , and corona and also help in developing research on the odds , forecast accuracy and explosive effects , etc. of comets and asteroids ' collision with earth .

russian troops held the last ceremony to bid farewell to germany on the 31st .
soldiers from three countries , namely , the us , uk and france will also withdraw from berlin in early september .
the occupying armies existing in german territory will end soon .
on september 1st , 1939 , hitler 's army attacked poland . it has just been 55 years now since the second world war ii which brought great suffering to the people of europe and the world .
a total of four million people from european countries died in this war , including those from germany .
among them , the ussr made a great sacrifice in the war to win over german invaders . its casualties were nearly 28 million .
half a century has passed in a flash , with europe experiencing hot war , cold war , turmoil and tremendous changes .
currently , both the hot and cold wars have passed , but the end of turmoil and conflict is not yet to be seen .
in the early period after the war , the four large countries , namely the ussr , the us , the uk and france , carved out their spheres of influence in accordance with the " yalta agreement " , and occupied germany and its capital by districts .
the highest policy - making authorities in germany then were the " control committee of the allied states " .
henceforth , germany was split up and in a powerless state for a long period .
not long after , the contest between the us and the ussr in europe caused a split in the original anti-fascist coalition , resulting in german 's division into two .
on the western side , the us organized nato and supported west germany for the purpose of keeping the ussr " in check " ; on the eastern side , the ussr organized the warsaw pact , and built up east germany as the bridgehead against the west .
germany , being split up , became the frontline of the cold - war confrontation between the east and west .
henceforth , there has not been a single day of peace in the political situation of europe , a crisis - ridden continent .
but , since the start of 1989 , a new turn has occurred in the european situation .
radical changes in eastern europe , the re-unification of germany , the dissolution of the warsaw pact and the disintegration of the ussr all occurred successively , causing difficulties in continuing the original " yalta system " .
in this great change , germany became the largest beneficiary .
the rise of a re-unified germany has changed the proportion of strength in europe , making the uk and france , which originally were large world powers , worry about dropping to second - class big countries .
the us , the only superpower today , has recently started to regard germany as a " partner in leadership " , encouraging it to " exercise a leadership role " in world politics . the reason is obvious : the us wants to make use of germany 's strength .
a unified germany is moving today from a large economic country to a large political country .
depending on its own tremendous strength , germany is playing a leading role in the european union , and its role as a " giant " is obviously seen by common people .
it spares no efforts in playing a " bridging role " between eastern and western europe and participating in the " peacekeeping mission " under the banner of the united nations , and is striving to be a permanent member country of the united nations security council .
currently , the historical post-war period is drawing to an end .
but the lesson of blood and tears and the painful experience it left for later generations still needs to continue and earnestly conclude .

lockheed and martin - marietta , two old - brand military industrial corporations of the us , announced merging on the 30th , forming the us 's largest defense equipment contractor corporation .
lockheed company and martin company are additional participants in the growing trend of takeovers and mergers of us companies in the last few months .
this trend has spread widely to pharmaceutical and medical instrument companies , telecommunication and high - tech companies as well as retail , banks and railway companies , etc .
according to the statistics of " time " magazine , from january to july this year , the asset value of takeovers announced by us companies was as high as 171.6 billion us dollars increasing by about half over the same period last year .
within that , in the first 7 months of this year , takeovers and mergers in total announced by four big us industries , medical treatment , media , telecommunications and banking , reached 1062 , accounting for one fourth of all takeovers . regardless of whether it is the number of takeover companies or the value of takeover assets , both exceeded or were close to the peak of us company takeovers in the late '80's .
observers here hold that since 1994 , reasons for the us company takeover trend differ from those of the past . firstly , the general trend of globalization of the world economy compels companies to expand scale and combine businesses , increase their overall competitive strength and to reduce costs . secondly , the clinton government 's thoughts and actions in constructing the information highway , adjusting the financial industry and reforming the medical insurance system compels related companies to make strategic adjustments .
moreover , the white house 's attitude towards anti-trust laws is somewhat more relaxed than before .
taking the pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies as an example , reforms of hospitals expanding scales of purchasing medicine and medical treatment equipment , and thus reducing unit costs and expanding services , have spread throughout the country .
that the columbia medical company purchased two hospital groups within one month last year , thus integrating pharmaceuticals , medical treatment and sales , is one such example .
for telecommunications companies , the merger of telephone companies with cable tv and wireless communications companies frequently is to mutually complement one another in operations and to dominate the market .
recently , the us congress passed an inter-state banking law , allowing regional banks to operate in other states . handholding among banks is also to reduce overlapping services so as to reduce costs , to strengthen base assets , and expand credit scales .
for military industry enterprises , the merger of lockheed and martin and the combination of two old - brand corporations , namely northrop and grumman , are both due to the same reason : after the cold war , the america 's national defense expenditures gradually reduced , and the scale and strength of military industry enterprises is one of the conditions necessary for winning limited government weapons purchasing contracts .
observers here believe that company takeovers has a positive aspect , i.e. , the reduction of cost , the increase in efficiency , and the strengthening of competitive power .
but , many takeovers are obviously actions that must be taken for companies to survive .
however , history has proven that " big and complete " monopolies of production and sales is not beneficial to the national economy 's healthy development .
for instance , in the '70's , mergers of us steel mills directly led to the birth of a few large - scale unified steel companies , but these companies also faced serious threats from small - scale steel mills , which are flexible in operation and advanced in technology .
moreover , company takeovers have had bad effects on consumers in terms of product quality and price , and at the same time on workers ' employment .
while voice has been given to the opinion that small enterprises are the new forces of economic growth , scaled operation of big corporations will constantly face new difficulties .

today , the " jerusalem post " quoted the words of shawel , director of the administrative office of the israeli foreign ministry who is now visiting the us as saying that the world bank has decided to provide 250 million us dollars of aid to palestinian autonomous authorities before the end of 1994 .
this decision broke the impasse between donor countries and palestinian autonomous authorities that had lasted for nearly one year .
at the international meeting on aiding palestinian autonomy which was held in washington on october 1st of last year , donor countries pledged to provide 2.4 billion us dollars of development aid within 5 years , of which 750 million us dollars would be appropriated in the first year .
but donor countries claimed that the palestinian autonomous region lacks necessary mechanisms for handling the aid and accounting items and therefore refused to completely fulfill this promise .
shawel said that although the us and the world bank are currently not completely satisfied with palestinian accounting work , they have still agreed to pay a portion of the funds as soon as possible .
arafat , chairman of the executive committee of the palestinian liberation organization , and other palestinian leaders have been criticizing the donor countries for not being able to keep their promise to make sure the money aid is completely in place and on time .
it is predicted that shashe , the plo 's chief negotiations representative , and rosechird , israel 's chief negotiations representative , will go to washington to specifically negotiate and determine the aid issues with the us and the world bank .

the weir group of the us recently signed an implementation agreement in beijing with jiangsu province 's electric power department to build china 's first large - capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas as fuel .
aixing dan , director of the international co-operation department of the electric power industry ministry , on this matter , expressed to xinhua news agency reporters today that if this power plant is successful , it will be a model for similar plants to be built along coastal regions .
coal , water , oil , etc. , are normally used for traditional electricity generation .
however , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc .
according to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade . this gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity .
because of the efficiency of this construction method , the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price .
at the same time , using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions .
the weir group , whose headquarters is in the us , is a large , specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation .
the installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts .
through the contact of the yizhong company of the us , the weir group and the jiangsu electric power department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant .
this power plant , which will be situated in rudong , jiangsu , has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts . the investment amount is 2.4 billion us dollars . the chinese side holds 30 % of the shares while the weir group holds 70 % .
according to the agreement , the weir group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant .
renzu luo , managing director of the weir group , is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along china 's coastal regions .
he holds that according to the experience of asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation . when the gross national product per capita reached 3000 us dollars in japan , south korea and taiwan , etc. , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .
as the gross national product in china 's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark , it can be said to have had the conditions for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial resources .
john weir , president of the weir group who visited china with us minister brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation plant construction in jiangsu , held that now is the best time to develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant with natural gas as fuel in china . both parties , the us and china , will invest more time , money and resources to make this power plant project a successful model .

peng li said that in the beginning of september of this year , the united nations would hold the international population and development congress in cairo with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
this shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
he feels that this congress has important meaning , and the chinese government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the congress .
peng li said china was the most populous developing country in the world .
the chinese government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
in light of china 's basic national condition , the chinese government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as two basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits china 's actual needs .
at the same time , the chinese government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
presently , the chinese economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
peng li said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
this is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
he said china was in a critical period of building up a socialist market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , china will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
the chinese government strongly believes that , the resolution of china 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
for this , the chinese government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co-operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !

the title of the theme song for the championships is very poetic . it is " water in water " .
the words and music of this song were composed by the famous italian musician claudio baglioni . at the opening ceremony , baglioni and the 60 year old tenor r. sceto , sang the theme song together .
many years ago , baglioni composed a song named " little love is as deep as the ocean " and it instantly became a popular hit throughout italy and made baglioni widely known as a popular song composer .
but , since 1992 , he has disappeared suddenly from the public eye .
when people were commenting on this , he again emerged mysteriously from obscurity and gave " water in water " to everyone which became the theme song of this world swimming championships .
baglioni has had a kind of preference for water since birth .
he said , " water is a topic which haunts repeatedly in my compositions . water is a product of nature .
it has the most natural characteristics of everything .
it is an approach to life and is the headspring of consciousness , emotion and music . "
he also said , " through swimming and diving sports , we come to understand water and feel its extensiveness and power , from which arises the idea of combining with it as one .
water makes people no longer separated far away . in singing " water in water " , our hearts beat together . "
the mascot of the world swimming championship is a little turtle named " carota " .
the figure of the turtle was designed by the famous italian designer w. lonbado .
its name came from an innocent and lovely little italian girl .
although a small turtle is clumsy on the beach , once in the sea , it becomes agile and free .
on the solid shell of the " little turtle " is embedded a map of the world composed of land and oceans . it implies that good swimming athletes coming from five continents and four oceans assembled together in rome to strengthen understanding and enhance friendship through competition .

a skin care nut - whitening .
beauty lover
in terms of whitening , i prefer the essence in the neotime gift set .
the bottle of essence itself is merely a kind of moisturizing lotion , but it comes with a complimentary bottle of l - ascorbic acid dry powder .
my way is to take a small bottle of 25 ml to pour the essence in , add a little l - ascorbic acid dry powder , and shake well .
the homemade whitening lotion like this will be consumed in about a week , and the same method is used to make more .
i have read relevant information that l - ascorbic acid oxidizes easily after it dissolves in the water .
it will lose the whitening effect once oxidized . so , make - and - consume can ensure what i use are the unoxidized whitening contents , which are pretty effective .
what 's more , this is a very cheap way of use .
neotime sells for over 300 a set , including day cream , night cream and essence , of which a bottle of essence lasts for two to three months if used my way .
it is a bit more affordable than the vitamin c whitening products that cost several hundred .
actually , i have used skii products .
if i 'm not financially constrained , i like to use skii goddess fluid . the skin was in a good state after use .
however , i heard recently that some contents in skii do harm to the skin over time , and so i dare not use any more after a second thought .
anyway , my skin now is very good without using it .
i do n't like wearing makeup , facing the sky everyday with bare skin .
this is because my former boyfriend said he liked me because i did n't wear makeup .
upon hearing this , i suddenly realized it turned out no men liked their girlfriend wearing makeup .
therefore , i practically do n't buy any makeups and never use blush or eyeshadow , apart from buying some lightening makeup base for use as sun screen .
i do n't know if everyone agrees with this .
anyway , i feel very easy on the face without makeup , no need to be careful everywhere .
i feel uncomfortable with lip color , which makes me careful even if i 'm just drinking water .

how should we care for our skin day - to - day ?
amy
who does n't want soft , white skin ?
but in real life our skin often gives us a hard time . if it 's not darkness or redness in the face , it 's dull and pallid .
what can we do ?
appropriately adjusting our diet could bring great improvements for our skin .
whatever is the problem with your skin , you should prescribe " vegetables " based on your symptom .
red face : this is caused by absorbing too much animal fat or protein .
the way to treat this is : when we eat foods containing animal fat or protein , we must supplement it with vegetables that contain plenty of chlorophyll , like spinach , celery or lettuce .
if we eat them raw , the effect is better .
we can also chop vegetables into tiny bits , wrap them in cloth , squeeze the juice and drink it . flushed face : the reason is poor circulation of blood , particularly a lack of blood flow to the epithelial cells .
when the weather is cold , people 's faces go red , particularly the tips of their noses .
the way to treat this is : 1. frequently bathe and massage to make the blood flow freely .
massage the red parts more . 2. to make the body fully absorb proteins better , we should eat plenty of food containing vitamin b1 and vitamin c . we can improve our absorption of vitamin d by exposure to sunlight .
oily dark face : this is caused by consuming too many animal oils and vegetable oils .
the way to treat this is : control the amount of animal and vegetable oils we consume and eat more vegetables containing chlorophyll .
before we eat , we should drink a glass of vegetable juice diluted with warm boiled water . the effect will be better .
dark face : generally speaking , the skin of people who consume too much salt is rough and dark . after exposure to the sun it is even worse . the hands and feet going black is caused by the salt in the body needing to be flushed out through the extremities .
if we consume too much salt , our face will gradually be covered with a layer of dark skin .
the way to treat this is : 1. control our intake of salt , drink plenty of water to flush out the salt through our urine .
2. bathing frequently , and soaking in the bathroom until you sweat , can also help to flush out some salt .
freckles on the face : consuming too much salt may cause freckles to appear on the face . and if in our diet we only absorb animal fats and protein , this will affect the normal functioning of liver and make the freckles more visible .
so those with freckles must eat plenty of fruit and vegetables .
as well as this , medicine is the great enemy of the skin . sedatives in particular will make the body produce too much acid . the hormones will become unbalanced and freckles will appear on the face .

what is life ?
carefree - like
a student in a university philosophy department started pondering the question of what is life .
but he asked everyone around him , and none of his teachers was able to answer him .
so he left the university and went looking for a wise man to ask .
after 10 years , he finally learned of a wise yogi deep in the mountains of india .
he thereupon set out on tortuous roads , crossing over towering mountain peaks , and finally he found this wise man .
the wise man was seated , with his eyes closed .
the student did n't dare startle him , so he simply waited from dawn until dusk , when the wise man opened his eyes slightly .
the student seized his chance and hastened to ask : what is life ?
the wise man 's gaze shifted slightly ; he looked far off into the mountains , and he said profoundly : life is a river .
the flustered student sprang to his feet : right ! i did n't take a university course on philosophical enlightenment and come all this way to hear you say what some little kid might say ! what the hell is life ?
the wise man was greatly surprised ; he too jumped up and said : you mean ... life is n't a river ?
guangzhou starts puffing itself up -lrb- reposted from moonlight blog -rrb-
dift wu
i went to sina.com today and suddenly saw a " strange " article from china business news : " guangzhou to become first mainland city with a gdp per capita of over 10,000 us dollars " <http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml> .
it says that the mayor of guangzhou has said that calculated by the number of people registered as residents , the gdp per capita of guangzhou this year will exceed 10,000 us dollars .
the reason i thought it was strange was because according to some data that i already knew about <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> , guangzhou 's gdp per capita should only reach the target of 10,000 us dollars in 2010 .
even though the rmb has increased in value , it still could n't be this fast . this figure must have something wrong with it . and the reason for the problem was still the population figure . shenzhen and other cities all calculate gdp per capita using the permanent resident population in the calculation .
for cities with such large migrant populations , a gdp per capita calculated using the number of registered residents will be very inaccurate . if guangzhou calculates the gdp per capita using the permanent resident population , it 's obviously puffing itself up .
people from guangdong are usually very low - key about wealth . they 'd never compare these vanities with beijing or shanghai . this way , they can pay a little less tax to the central authorities : keeping quiet to get rich .
in addition , everyone is very clear about the situations in guangzhou and shenzhen . for many years guangzhou has been just a little behind shenzhen in its economic indices and all aspects . its gdp will soon be exceeded by shenzhen 's , yet its population has always been higher than shenzhen 's .
i remember i wrote an article " the mystery of shenzhen 's gdp per capita <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> . "
shenzhen 's gdp per capita is calculated using the number of permanent residents , and it is predicted that it wo n't top 10,000 us dollars until about 2008 . how could guangzhou 's leaders make this kind of wild assertion ?
this kind of showing off has never been the style of people from guangdong .
various signs show that the new team of leaders in guangzhou may have been transferred from another region . they tend to like boasting and like playing number games to seek rewards from the central authorities .
if this really is the case , then guangzhou 's prospects for economic development may be indeed not good .
fewer empty words and more real action has always been the straightforward style of people from guangdong . only by keeping the wealth among the people can a nation be ultimately rich . making the majority of people rich is the most important .
i hope the new team of leaders in guangzhou will carefully learn from the experiences and lessons of the last few administrations and not to rival with places like beijing and shanghai in exaggeration . otherwise guangzhou 's development will really be a cause for worry .

copyright announcement : may be reproduced at will ; when reproducing , please be sure to hyperlink the original source and the author 's information and this announcement http://www.donews.net/pangshengdong .
note : i'm 'm really embarrassed if this header is a bit flashy , but there 's no other way ; i hope more media will reproduce this article and let more people see it , so the header needs to attract attention .
the scheme behind this article is just one example ; i want to use it to inform everyone that things should be done with a clear objective , and they need to be thought out clearly beforehand . what kind of results will this achieve ? describe it in detail and write it down .
this way , you'll 'll improve your efficiency in everything you do .
of course this article does have considerable value ; it 's a summary of my 28 years of living and establishing a business , and what i say in it is not necessarily right , but i 'm confident that it can get you started .
a brief self - introduction .
my name is pang shengdong <http://pangshengdong.com/> . i was born in 1977 into an ordinary peasant household in tiantai , zhejiang . my mother was a peasant and my father was a carpenter ; they were both typical , solid country folk .
i got a job in 1998 ; i first wasted three years working in a public institution , and in 2001 i began setting up my own business ; i got things rolling , and i amassed a considerable amount .
in july of 2005 i invested in and established 51.com , serving as ceo .
51.com would provide a psychological harbor for millions of young chinese females .
starting from nothing , in six months ' time 51.com would enter the worldwide top 400 sites ; in 10 months ' time it entered the top 200 sites , and in 12 months ' time it was among the top 100 !
now there are many risk investment companies expressing their clear intention to invest .
in my early years , i always believed that by relying on my smarts and effort i should eventually be able to live a pretty good life , but i never thought that when i was 28 i 'd be living in a fine home , be driving an audi , have so many investors in my company , and have more than a hundred employees .
many people ask me , why ? why are you able to make money ? i ask myself the same question .
i need to sum it all up , to find out the reasons i can make money , to find out which qualities determined today 's achievements , to keep from slowly losing these qualities .
why am i able to make money ?
making money means letting other people give you money ; it 's selling things .
i made money because : i sold things to many people .
why are there so many people who buy my things ?
if i look at it from this angle , and briefly sum it all up , the following are the main reasons :
1. good character :
people 's outlook is bright ; if your everyday character is such that you are always thinking of other people , your things ca n't be too shoddy .
a good person finds it easier to design good things , and good service models .
i am a good person , i can say that with a clear conscience .
to date , no one has been able to surpass the securities service model i designed four years ago .
i think being a good person is the first reason i am able to make money .
2. effort , progress , and constant study :
this is the basic quality for success ; there has never been any free lunch in the world , and since i graduated i've worked and studied 14 hours every day .
pay attention to the concept of constant study ; regardless of what you do , you need to give it careful consideration , and you 'll gain an understanding of it ; any time is study time .
3. dare to act !
take no action , then there 's no opportunity for sure !
if you feel you can bear this risk , if you feel you can make do with the resources you have , then get cracking !
4. luck : luck is also important .
actually , now you can get the opportunity that this internet provides , and everybody 's luck has gotten better .
do n't say that this completely new , revolutionary application , this huge market , which has grown so fast , is entirely taken up by big companies ; do n't say the current situation is so disadvantageous . five years from now , when we look back at 2005 , we 'll say that these were good times created by the internet .
5. business flair and iq :
my past business judgments demonstrate that i have a flair for business ; i think my business sense is pretty sharp .
6. systematic thinking enables you to grasp the key points of any mater .
7. strong cooperative awareness : nobody can do everything . you need a team to make up for inadequacies in each person 's ability and experience .
in fact , i previously wrote a similar article , and everybody can search for it on baidu or google .
eventually i may specially rewrite it to describe in detail how to find a business that will make money . everyone please note my blog on donews http://blog.donews.com/pangshengdong .
what i say is not necessarily right , but i am confident that if you read it carefully it should give you a start .
regarding everyone 's suggestions :
1. what you pay out you will get back .
thinking more of other people , seeing things from their shoes : before you know it , we may also have the habits of good people , and this will raise our happiness index and our likelihood of succeeding .
most successful people are good people !
2. people are naturally lazy , but if we want to succeed , if we want to make a lot of money , we need to think positively and make a greater effort !
everybody has more or less the same iq ; what can you use to make money ?
hah ! really make an effort !
at the same time , make sure you study constantly !
3. remember : things are possible only when you act !
4. business opportunities can be analyzed ; this requires a good model of thinking and adequate information .
how to analyze ? eventually i will write an article explaining this in detail .
5. pay attention to teamwork ; one person can not achieve great things .
always try to acquire friends who have abilities and experiences that complement yours .
if you want to establish a successful business , it 's extremely important to have several good partners . 6. joining up with a good company is also a shortcut to getting rich ; many new companies are now hiring , and 51.com is currently hiring on a large scale <http://companyads.51job.com/companyads/shanghai/sh/shengdong_060627/i...> . everybody can also go read my blog ; that 's also a good opportunity .
you need to seize opportunities immediately , otherwise you may end up kicking yourself .
at the end of 2005 51.com will be listed among the 500 top companies on the alexa web site .
7. if you have a chance , interact with those who are actually successful .
read what those who are really successful have written ; articles like this are hard to come by .
i urge everyone to read the new book written by li kaifu , the president of google china ; the book by li jian , the president of pinsou , is also not bad .
in short : as long as you make an effort , are willing to do it ! and pay attention to your methods , everybody has a chance to succeed !
everybody has a chance to become a multimillionaire .

is it really healthy to drink milk on empty stomach ?
healthy and happy
protein will be wasted to drinking milk on empty stomach ?
some say drinking milk on empty stomach will consume the protein wastefully as energy ,
but actually milk contains about 45 % lactose , which is carbohydrate that will decompose first to supply energy and save protein .
in addition , milk also contains about 3 % fat , which also plays the role of supplying energy .
therefore , drinking milk on empty stomach will not lead to protein waste .
the fact that infants under the age of one can drink milk on empty stomach and absorb nutrients proves that milk contains a variety of nutrients that can be fully used by the human body .
even if the digestion rate will be slightly lowered , it is healthier to drink milk on empty stomach than to eat nothing the whole morning when there is no time for breakfast .
tip : drink boiled water before milk .
it is not appropriate to take milk as the only drink in the early morning .
when you get up in the morning , it 's better to drink a big glass of boiled water -lrb- light honey water is better in case of a dry indoor environment during the heating season -rrb- before consuming milk .
as milk has higher osmotic pressure , it is far less quick and effective compared to boiled water in terms of supplying moisture .
who can not drink milk on empty stomach ?
what needs our attention is that if there are abdominal distention or diarrhea after drinking milk , it is then indeed inappropriate to drink a lot of milk with on empty stomach .
it is better to have some starchy food before you drink milk in multiple small serves , and it is better to have yogurt .
experts said milk can not be consumed on empty stomach 20 years ago , because chinese had few chances to drink milk .
once they were weaned from breast milk , they hardly saw any dairy products . long - term separation from dairy products led to " lactose intolerance " of the body .
people suffered abdominal distention , diarrhea or dyspepsia whenever they drink milk .
if they drink too fast , especially drinking milk on empty stomach , the symptom would exacerbate .
now time is different , and the diet pattern has also changed .
many children and young people often consume milk , yogurt , ice cream and even cheese since childhood , which bring them strong ability to digest milk lactose . even if they drink milk on empty stomach , they will not feel uncomfortable .
so , the so - called remark of " no milk on an empty stomach " should be changed , at least with a premise added , instead of being generalized .

cloudy , temperature approx. 2 degrees .
while qingqing was rinsing her mouth for the second time last night , mom said : leaks air and leaks rain .
qingqing was unhappy upon hearing that . she pounded mom with her little fists .
dad also scolded mom : you also leaked air and leaked rain while your permanent teeth grew in your childhood .
qingqing looked at mom with water in the mouth . at last , she said to mom after spitting it into the basin : i meant to spew it on your head .
dad praised qingqing for being thoughtful : knowing what she should do .
qingqing played in bed after waking up in the morning . dad yelled , but she would n't get up and wanted to play a little longer .
dad looked at qingqing and teased qingqing : how come this kid opens her eyes while sleeping ?
how come this kid sounds like " enen " while snoring ?
qingqing told dad : i am just teasing you .
after she got up and dressed , she would n't eat the red bean buns or red sticky rice congee prepared by dad . instead she asked for soaked biscuits and did drawings in the room after finishing .
after a simple lunch , qingqing wanted to buy stickers at jinsheng . she bumped into grandma on her way and also saw a lost dog advertisement on a wire pole .
dad read to qingqing , and then we arrived at jinrunfa by shuttle bus , but could n't find the stickers that qingqing wanted .
we then went to jinsheng , where we finally found them . dad bought four volumes : .
one for each of her two sisters .
one to be placed at qingqing 's home and one at her kindergarten .
qingqing arranged everything very well . we got on the bus to dine out . mom asked qingqing to make a choice : is the back of the bus empty or full .
qingqing first chose " full . " when it was almost there , mom asked qingqing to choose again , and qingqing chose " empty . "
qingqing said after getting off : i won .
mom said : i intentionally let you win , otherwise you will lose .
qingqing wanted to pee on the way , dad had to hold qingqing to pee by the tree .
it was very cold , and dad tidied qingqing 's pants quickly .
qingqing wanted to play with the sticker after we arrived at the hotel . dad discussed conditions with qingqing : dad will let you play if you eat well .
qingqing agreed and began to play again .
mom said she wanted to swap to another place , but dad wanted to let qingqing stay longer in the sun .
qingqing was so obsessed with playing that she would n't have dinner .
dad had to put away qingqing 's sticker book and asked qingqing to eat well .
qingqing said it was spicy and she would n't eat . mom promised to buy qingqing white fungus broth later . qingqing became happy immediately and played on .
we walked home after eating , and qingqing played in her own room after dinner .
dad said it was time to sleep , but she would n't sleep until after she played for a while in bed . she told dad that she wanted to take one book to the kindergarten .
qingqing said today : the teacher said last time that she would repay the money she borrowed from me the next day , but she has not repaid yet .
oh ! grown - ups would n't live up to their words either .

on the train mom noticed qingqing farting and asked qingqing whether he +wanted to poo . she also said to qingqing : " i gave birth to you , how could i not know what you are thinking about ? "
in the evening when washing his feet at home , mom said : " let 's sell our house , buy a house next to grandma 's , and give dad the remaining money to start a business with , is that okay ? "

he promised uncle yesterday that from now on he would take uncle 's call . qingqing was calling uncle " stupid , " just like he called dad .
after finishing the call , qingqing showed dad the math book he got from the auction and told dad : " i know how to do math . "
he also said : " today mom and i went to pop the rice ovalettes . the rice ovalettes were still moist , so they did n't get fully popped . "
he then play the keyboard by himself , turning down the volume so as not to disturb the old grandma next door from her rest . what a thoughtful kid !
dad had had a bit too much to drink and did not talk much to qingqing before he fell asleep .

setting up an internet business : what do you need ?

setting up an internet business : what do you need ?
experience in setting up a business : my " boss " dream three stages of setting up a business from scratch the critical path of success talking about setting up a business
now , as the internet grows , the internet economy has passed through a " bubble era " and is gradually moving toward a dazzling springtime .
when you look at the it giants that have sprouted up one after the other on the internet , do you get excited ?
are you worried ?
are you determined ?
setting up an internet business is an idea that appeals to people . because : 1. low cost
unless they are undertaking a very large project , internet entrepreneurs do not need much capital .
perhaps one computer + adsl + a dummy mainframe + a small room and you can get started .
but this is still far , far from success . some people may scoff that this ca n't be called setting up a business .
if you have plenty of funds , very sharp thinking , and a classic idea , you do n't need to read what i wrote . but do n't stick up your nose ; for the time being we 're not talking about the relationship between capital and profit .
you feel that if the cost is insignificant , the profit must not be worth mentioning .
well , now i 'm telling you you're 're wrong .
this traditional cost - profit relationship just does n't work on the internet .
because you 've overlooked one thing , and that 's your own intelligence and ability .
in setting up an internet business , this holds a more important position .
the internet is absolutely a place for the daring to be forceful .
if you have the ability , you can hope to succeed .
2. low start - up cost
internet communications are now well developed .
it can be said that all you need is broadband , and you 've solved most of your internet communication problems and can save yourself a lot of telephone charges .
at the same time , you do n't need to go out and rent a storefront and pay exorbitant rents .
early on , before you 've formally registered the company , you also do n't have to be bothered with lots of petty charges and taxes .
3. staffing is very simple ; in the early stages many entrepreneurs start from scratch , with one person handling all tasks .
because one person can basically cope with everything in the early stages , there is no need to incur personnel costs .
4. the risk is low , so if the business fails , you do n't need to be afraid .
because the initial investment is low , there are greater opportunities for turnover .
therefore the entrepreneur can give up without fearing the consequences of failure .
5. high profit
if you succeed early on in setting up your business and continue on down the right path of development , then i congratulate you . now you can shout it out : " my web site is making a profit ! "
but do n't let the first bucket of money you make go to your head .
do n't forget , the higher you climb , the higher you 'll fall .
remind yourself that now is the time you need to keep a close watch on developments in market trends and among your competitors .
promptly adjust your growth strategy .
only then will you be smiling at the end .
maybe when you read about the advantages of establishing an internet business above , your heart was racing and you were thinking you 'd really work hard to make it .
below i 'm going to discuss some of the areas that you need to pay attention to when setting up an internet business :
1. use your own unique vision to examine the internet and look for new ways to make a profit .
aggressively investigate new projects ; avoid blindly imitating others .
are there lots of people doing this kind of thing on the internet ? if a flasha.com appears on the net today , tomorrow there will be flashc.com and flashd.com .
if that 's the case , your odds of failing just increased by 30 % .
remember : if you 're always following on somebody else 's tail , then what you'll get will always be someone else 's trash , picked over , cast aside and unused .
of course we 're not opposed to imitating , but what we should think about is why is this person taking that route , and not which route is this person taking .
then we will study the line of thought and the skills he used to solve problems .
so we will gain more than he did .
2. if you 've selected a given project and are carrying it out , then you should definitely carry it through to the end ; avoid switching course in midstream .
of course when i say see it through to the end , this does not mean to continue blindly , sticking with it even when you know full well it 's hopeless .
what i mean is , do n't be distracted , doing sms today and selling things tomorrow , with a new approach every day .
you see somebody else doing something that makes money , and you think you want to do that .
your website is simply the " art of changing your look " like in sichuan opera .
a new face every day , completely different .
what i recommend is that when you set up your business you should give it careful consideration and fully investigate its feasibility .
once you set out to do something , you should pursue the goal you set for yourself , sticking with it unless really forced to give up .
3. use your hands , eyes and brain , be observant and alert , and consider all possibilities .
avoid acting rashly when you set up your internet business .
your mind needs to be sharp ; the internet offers virtually unlimited business opportunities ; maybe it 's just a small opportunity , but you should seize it .
then maybe you will succeed .
otherwise if the opportunity was right in front of you and you did n't seize it . so ... you need nimble hands .
if you come upon something important , by all means make a note of it , and so on .
your eyes need to be sharp : you need to spot changes in the it situation right away and quickly prepare a short - term business plan .
like right now , many portal sites are seizing the opportunity of the olympics to considerably increase their traffic .
i think advertising revenues in this area alone will be considerable . 4. be tough and resilient : avoid the easy route . setting up an internet business is hard labor .
when you 're just setting up your business , it is sometimes hard to avoid feeling completely exhausted .
sometimes you 'll just feel like throwing in the towel .
do n't forget : if you were working for someone else , you would n't like it either , and may feel even worse !
5. you need to learn to look for partners .
6. you need to know what internet marketing is , and learn how to use it .
are you looking for an already proven , feasible way to increase your sources of income ?
are you looking for an opportunity to create both free time and financial freedom ?
do you have dreams or goals that you want to reach ?

an intellectual who was a lifelong leading official until death -- a few disrespectful words about director ba
613305
-lsb- ghost turning the mill -rsb-
the lifelong term system of leading cadres is not good , and it has long been criticized by intellectuals .
the so - called idea about the lifelong term system of leading cadres means when the end of a term of office comes , or when a given age is reached , they should step down .
this point has already been put into practice , though not fully implemented in reality .
some very bad practices have n't been abolished yet : i.e. the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres .
what is known as the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres means that when a leading cadre steps down from his senior position , he still retains his level of remuneration such as " division leader level . "
even worse is that as soon as you become a leading cadre , you are then a leader for life , with no need to worry about any problems of being laid off .
if your department disappears , it does n't matter , either .
a sinecure can always be arranged for you at a salary high enough for you to maintain your integrity , like going to the cppcc to serve as some deputy chairperson .
if you do n't break the law , you will only move upwards , you wo n't slip downwards .
i think we should completely abolish the life - long term system of leading cadres . for example , if a person is mayor , when he steps down at the end of his term , he could no longer be given mayor level remuneration .
if he is not able enough and becomes a division leader , then he should be remunerated at the division leader level .
if he 's even more incompetent and has been laid off , then he should be like a laid - off factory worker and collect unemployment benefits .
he should n't go to the mayor , but to the markets . the " iron rice bowl " was broken for workers decades ago . there is no reason why leading cadres should still be holding onto a golden rice bowl . i 've had a look at director ba 's biography and was surprised to find that director ba had been chairman of the writers ' association since 1983 right up until he passed away .
i think that the writers ' association is n't any kind of important department affecting the national economy and people 's livelihood and whether it was the lifelong term system would draw nobody 's attention . but director ba , as an intellectual who always spoke the truth and stood up for what was right , should have known that the lifelong term system of leaders is not good , and should have been opposed .
moreover , when director ba became chairman of the writers ' association , he was already quite elderly .
doing it for one or two terms , he 'd be +really senile however you look at it . he had his own health problems . how could he have that much energy to manage the affairs of the writers ' association ? it would have been better to get off the pot .
in fact , in his last days , director ba lay in the hospital , unable even to speak , completely reliant on medical intervention to keep him alive . even if he wanted to manage , he would have been unable to .
" harvest " magazine was created by director ba single - handedly , and he was always its chief editor .
even if later on it was director ba junior who took over the work , it still carried director ba 's name .
after director ba passed away , the magazine still wrote that he was the chief editor . in the end someone got really mad and filed a legislative complaint .
but this affair had no further development afterwards .
i guess the biggest reason maybe is because of director ba 's great influence , everyone settled out of court ; both sides gave a little ground , and director ba junior no longer used director ba senior 's name in doing advertisements for the magazine .
to say a little more : right now all the intellectuals are all heaping praise on director ba 's " random thoughts . " they think it " speaks the truth , " " stands up for what 's right . "
however , what i like is director ba 's " torrents " trilogy and " cold nights . "
director ba had written the works that made his name , and are his greatest works , before he was thirty .
i believe that what he said at that time was very honest .
he was using his heart and blood in his writing . if you read the afterwords he 's written you 'll know .
he says he was often crying as he was writing .
i 've also seen that director ba was +under the deep influence of extreme leftism at that time and said many good things about the totalitarian society .
peasants blocking roads and clashing with the police : who should reflect on this ?
613305
-lsb- xinhua , jiu taiping -rsb- posted on january 14 , 2007 2:00:25 p.m. -lrb- sms -rsb- -- -lsb- outer form -rsb- .
jiu taiping
" rocks were moved onto the road , and several dozen peasants stood in the middle of the road , several hundred cars were backed up , and rocks were thrown at the police .... "
yesterday morning after 10:00 o'clock , villagers from some 40 households in zhaojiacun , xiaojie township , chongming county , unhappy with the blasting for road construction that was damaging their homes , crowded onto the section at the 67th kilometer of kunqu highway now being built , throwing stones and blocking the road for more than four hours , causing a backup of hundreds of cars . -lrb- january 14 , capital city news -rrb- .
it is unreasonable to block roads and cut off traffic even if the villagers ' homes were being damaged by the blasting for road construction and the economy was being hurt ; these methods are illegal and harm innocent bystanders ; they are unacceptable .
if there is a problem , they should seek out the concerned departments , that 's all .
however , the villagers ' agitation has its own reasons .
you might say it ca n't be helped .
if they had been able to resolve the problem through regular channels , they would n't have taken such a step .
china 's peasants are simple and decent folk ; quite often when they get the short end of the stick they suffer in silence . if it is not something that affects their livelihood , they are not easily moved to take action .
they may be simple and decent and may accept bullying , but when someone rides on their backs and dumps on them , they wo n't take it any more , and they explode .
in my view , the concerned parties ' disregard for the people 's interests is the basic reason that brought this on .
at the same time , in this disturbance both the villagers and the police are the victims of bureaucracy .
in the news reports , we clearly felt that the behavior of the police went beyond enforcement of the law ; their behavior infringed on human rights .
for example , when the dustup began between the people and the police , " one policeman took out a camera and photographed me ; i used my hand to block it , and another policeman kicked me in the stomach . i immediately squatted down , and then they beat me on the face and head , i do n't know who it was ; i wiped my face with my hand , my hand was full of blood , they had broken open my mouth . "
although the peasants ' blocking the road was against the law , the police can maintain order according to the law ,
but what right do the police have to beat people and even to kick a woman in the stomach ? "
it also might be said that when a mob situation arises the police do n't want to clash with the people ; most often the police are following orders to suppress the mob and help officials restore order . in life , some local government officials encounter problems of fierce resistance from the people ; instead of thinking of ways to smooth over and resolve the problem , they first think of suppressing it , and they 're accustomed to mobilizing the police force to forcefully carry that out .
in fact the harsher the suppression the more likely there will be a conflict , bringing on even greater feelings of opposition between police and people and between cadres and the masses , which does n't help resolve the problem .
taking this case as an example , the common folk blocked the road because the local government did not resolve the problem .
if it had resolved it , no one would have broken the law !
although you can say that blocking the road was illegal , it 's also not a violent act ; the police should have continued directing traffic , and they might not have resorted so quickly to force .
who brought about the clash between the police and the villagers ?
who bears responsibility ?!
i believe we should first look into the local government 's nonfeasance in ignoring the interests of the people .
" the interests of the masses are no small matter " is not just a slogan ; it needs to be made real .
now that there has been this disturbance , the concerned parties need to be vigilant ; they take the initiative and pay compensation for the reinforcement work , sooner rather than later .
the reason is very simple : people 's homes , which were originally unstable , can still be maintained for several more years ; this shock was n't caused by the people , and compensation should be paid .
moreover , it is useless to quibble further about how much money should be spent on the compensation issue .
i believe there is only one standard : if someone 's house was destroyed , the party who destroyed it should restore it to its original condition , without regard to how much money the damage is worth , afraid to spend one red cent ; just restore it to the original condition .
if the wrangling over the compensation issue goes on forever , then i believe the government is still not sincere in resolving the matter of the people 's interests ; if it drags on and on , it will only intensify the conflict and make the people angry , and history will repeat itself .
do , keep bullying the peasants ; they have it tough enough !
the peasants have suffered enough !
give them the means to live !
is blast demolition implementation of the scientific view of development ?

is blast demolition implementation of the scientific view of development ?
wenhai .
while i was watching a tv channel , i heard from its news , " the tallest building beside the west lake in hangzhou was blast demolished only 14 years after completion , because it ruined the west lake views . "
it is said blasting this " image project " reflects " the scientific view of development " of this hangzhou government .
it is unbelievable to see the report associate the blast demolition with the scientific view of development .
the high riser has only been used for 14 years . what does it mean by 14 years ?
if some messy buildings are left undecorated after six years of completion , i think it is not inappropriate at all to describe 14 years as " brand new . "
it took such a great fortune to build a high riser like this , and now it is blasted at an order .
how wasteful it is in ordinary people 's eyes .
i will never ever believe everyone in hangzhou has a place to live in without any impoverished households .
if such a great fortune was from government appropriation , how many tax payers were needed ?
if it was invested by some business person , how many machines were needed to run and how many workers were needed to be busy ?
how many people can receive education and healthcare , among other things , with such a great fortune ? what is the scientific view of development ? the core is putting people first .
the scientific view of development will never waste resources at will , or let people bleed and toil in vain .
the scientific view of development emphasizes a conservation - minded society . the scientific view of development focuses on urban planning .
maybe some people say this tall building has ruined the west lake views , and now we have attached importance to the scientific view of development .
i would say please wait .
if hangzhou has only this one " image project , " the blast of which could restore its original state , it can be barely regarded as " scientific development . " the problem is whether it will work ?
hangzhou belongs to people of the entire nation . so many chinese have been to hangzhou .
the leifeng tower was fallen down for years , which also symbolized the emancipation of chinese women , but later on a lot of money was invested to build a fake tower standing beside the west lake .
a tour guide said : " people often went up to explore the relics before it was built , but they have become reluctant to go up after it was built . "
this affects the west lake , reducing tourists at the scenic spot .
should we also push over the fake leifeng tower ?
even if it were pushed over , would things go back to " people going up to explore relics ? "
thus , blasting the high riser can not be associated with the scientific view of development .
when it was first built , it was for image in spite of public objections . some netizens even said it was for political feats , dining out , going on inspection tours , contract awarding , and various other benefits .
if the construction was for image , then the scientific view of development should never be the excuse for its blast demolition .
if it is really designed to implement the scientific view of development , then simply erect a plate at the " fake leifeng tower , " which indicates " who " managed the construction of the fake tower .
i guarantee there will be tourists exploring relics . -lrb- original works of wenhai -rrb- .
yan
construction is science development , and blast demolition is scientific development .
does zhang weiying 's misinterpretation of revolution harbor malicious intent ?
613305
-lsb- ＊lingtai shanyin＊ -rsb- . in an interview with professor zhang weiying that i read recently , when i read professor zhang 's understanding of revolution , i felt deeply worried - deeply worried for beijing university , deeply worried for some outstanding contemporary youth , and deeply worried for the future of the country .
some people oppose the whole class struggle thing , some people deny mao zedong thought , but today , with democracy making progress , some people have the nerve to talk about revolution !!!
so as not to take his words out of context , i will insofar as possible cite professor zhang 's explanation of revolution :
" in reality , ' the way ' - or we can call it ' reason ' - has quite a complex relationship with the law . what we call ' reason ' involves looking at what you do to see whether it creates value for society . ' reason ' is above ' law ' : reasonable things have a natural validity ; lawmaking should be carried out according to the demands of reason ; unreasonable laws are not correct .
but in china , both in the past and now , there are many reversals of the natural order between law and reason ; thus making it hard to judge if a so - called " illegal " thing is also unreasonable .
for example , when there was a revolution in the past , it was precisely the most idealistic people who were willing to sacrifice their lives . why sacrifice their lives ? because it was illegal .
or take bribery for example . when someone is being blackmailed , he hands over the money , and that is a form of bribery . but you ca n't say that his doing that is wrong : at least he deserves our empathy . "
1. in human history , there is a clear standard for good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , etc .
this standard is :
things that are for the majority , for the masses of people , for altruism are good , righteous , progressive , glorious , advanced .
things that are for the minority , against the people and self - serving are bad , unrighteous , shameful , reactionary .
revolution is clearly a thing for the majority , for the masses of people , and altruistic ; therefore revolution is good , righteous , progressive , glorious and advanced !
2. law has a clear class character ; bourgeois reason makes no sense for proletarian law .
and proletarian reason makes no sense for bourgeois law !
on major issues of principle , lawmaking starts with the protection of the interests of a particular class ; it is not that ' reason ' tops ' law ' : rational things have a natural validity ; so the making of laws should be carried out according to the requirements of reason , and irrational laws are wrong . "
this kind of so - called " reason " ignores the class nature of law , and in terms of the great theoretician professor zhang 's , this is a classic example of malicious intent .
what is professor zhang 's purpose in his misinterpretation of revolution and his ignoring the class nature of law ?
1. he misinterprets revolution in order to confuse good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , and to advance some unnamable theories .
2. he ignores the class nature of law in order to enact laws that harm the interests of the masses of workers and peasants .
unfortunately , professor zhang may have greatly miscalculated .

topic : -lsb- cjpt -rsb- roach : risk capital will be the next bubble .
posting station : bbs unnamed space station -lrb- mon jan 22 21:09:59 2007 -rrb- , dump .
□ morgan stanley 's leading economist , stephen roach .
several major lessons of 2006 rather reasonably explain the main developing trends in last year 's markets , namely that the current situation in the financial markets embodies the effects of all these developments interacting with one another .
in particular , in an era of excess current capital , risk capital high - income company bonds , structural credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities will be the next bubble .
global rebalancing . this is a topic that i have spent much of the last five years trying to get people to be concerned about .
to put it simply , the rebalancing theory holds that if the gap between countries with trade surpluses and deficits continues to expand , it will harm the sustained growth of the world 's economy .
in the last two years , regular account deficits in the u.s. averaged more than 800 billion dollars annually ; the u.s. accepted nearly 70 % of the earned surplus reserve of the world 's other countries , the equivalent of needing to bring in some 35 billion dollars per average business day in outside financial burden .
in a nutshell , the rebalancing plan the world so urgently needs is nothing more than a thorough reshaping of the global savings mix - that is , an improvement in the u.s. savings rate , which has been stagnant for a long time , and a lessening of excessive savings in other countries -lrb- especially in asia and the middle east -rrb- .
if the world 's savings mix does not change , the rebalancing theory holds that the situation will be very harmful to outside financing in deficit economic systems . as for the united states , this will augur low exchange rates for the u.s. dollar , and an expansion of effective interest rates on u.s. - dollar capital .
but this did not happen in 2006 . although as the end of the year approached the u.s. dollar dropped somewhat , and effective interest rates continued to climb , this movement was still very far from the radical adjustments predicted by the framework of the rebalancing theory .
this phenomenon has two possible explanations : one is that other factors cropped up and intervened ; the other is that the theory basically does not stand up .
i choose the former ; i believe the reason lies in the prolongation of the period of excess current capital worldwide and the policy of central banks in asia and the middle east of buying up u.s. dollars .
so long as these forces are in play , the effects on financial markets recognized by the rebalancing theory will continue to be softened .
globalized tracks .
last year was an important milestone in the globalization process .
benefiting from an acceleration in the pace of transnational integration , global trade for the first time accounted for a record - setting 30 % - plus of global gdp in 2006 .
from 1998 to 2006 , the increase in global trade accounted for fully 42 % of the overall increase in the world 's total output value .
this kind of trade concentration has the potential for a huge macroeconomic impact on global growth .
the rapidly exploding supply of goods and services from low - production - cost developing countries is equivalent in terms of function to a strong anti-inflationary counterblast blowing on the developed world .
despite rapid rises in energy costs , it is estimated that in 2006 the cpi inflation rate in the industrialized countries was only 24 % , about the same as inflation levels in 2005 , which were affected by energy factors , but each year 's " core " elements did not change much .
although the labor and product markets in most large industrial nations are gradually improving , sustained low inflation is increasingly becoming a global force , exerting an effective counterbalance effect on internal pressures that have always contributed to inflation in developed countries .
u.s. real estate bubble shock .
like the stock market bubble six years ago , another prime - assets bubble burst in 2006 ; this time it was the huge u.s. real estate bubble .
just as the bursting of the 2000 - 01 stock market bubble led to mild collapse , i am worried that people are discarding too quickly the risk of a similar situation occurring in 2007 .
first , adjustment of the housing market has just begun ; taking the number of workers in the u.s. home construction industry as an example , current figures are only 15 % below the cumulative increase over the last five years .
second , over-indebted american consumers with their insufficient savings are using their increasingly overvalued houses to support their excessive consumption ; and now housing prices are turning soft , people are losing their rights to redeem their mortgage , and consumer demand will face greater pressures .
third , in the presence of a dim outlook for housing and consumer markets and high sensitivity to forecasts of ultimate market demand , capital expenditure plans may slacken ; orders for core capital products declined consecutively in november and december , 2006 , indicating that the adjustment in this area may already be under way .
just like the stock market bubble six years ago , widespread public opinion holds that any damage done by the recent asset bubble will be kept within the u.s. housing construction industry .
i believe this is a classic example of not learning our lesson .
the staple commodities cycle .
the view that commodity markets have supercycles ran into a serious challenge in 2006 .
oil prices slipped by more than 25 % from their mid-july peak and the price of natural gas fell by more than 30 % , and prices for major metals like copper , which are sensitive to economic trends , showed signs of weakening at the end of the year .
the main premise of the supercycle theory hangs on an extremely reliable shortage of staple commodities ; this shortage was created because in the last 20 - odd years there has been a shortage of capital to invest in building new capacity for acquisition and processing .
whereas the advance of globalization will spur sources of new demand from china , india and other commodity - intensive economic systems , asymmetry between supply and increasingly fierce demand causes exponents of supercycles to issue the highest commodity price forecasts in history .
in my view , this does not give adequate consideration to latent demand cycles in commodity markets .
the american real estate market shock is an example of this ; a sluggish market will cause demand for many materials sensitive to the homebuilding industry to drop sharply .
however , the real demand cycle may depend on china , an economic system that accounts only for approximately 5 % of the world 's gdp , but whose increased consumption of oil and key metals accounted for fully 50 % of total global growth last year .
influenced by the slowing of exports to the united states , combined with the deliberate cool - down in the overheated investment sector , china 's growth will slow next year .
these demand factors will be adequate to deliver a decisive blow to the supercycle view of the supply - driven commodity market .
but will the lessons of 2006 be the key to success in 2007 ? of course things are not as simple as that .
we can undoubtedly draw some important lessons and tips from last year 's economy , but there is another important thing here ; i still believe that the two main engines driving global growth will slow down under the influence of the burst real estate bubble in the united states and the cool - down in investments in china .
even though i do not believe the global economy is in for a hard landing , if global growth slips one percentage point below the average of 49 % for the last four years , i will not think it unexpected .
my greatest concern is that people continue to treat lightly the continually booming risk assets markets ; they include high - yield corporate bonds , institutional credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities , and this is going to be the next bubble .
however , like the stock and real estate markets , the economy tells us that the extreme case of the asset markets can always last longer than we anticipate , particularly in a time of excess current capital , but if the risk assets bubble lasts another year , it may cause more problems .

china is capable of withstanding the impacts brought to china by us economic recession .
http://web.wenxuecity.com/bbsviewphp?subid=currentevent&msgid=159556 .
source : changbaishan , jan 10 , 2007 12:58:27 am .
china is capable of withstanding the impacts brought to china by us economic recession .
following the recession in 2001 , the us economy has entered into " soft - landing " adjustment after five years of continuous expansion .
some expect that in 2007 the us economic growth rate will drop to 1.9 - 2.5 percent , the interest rate will drop to 4 percent , and the us dollar will continue to depreciate .
once the us economy is in recession , will impacts will it bring to china ?
and what measures will china take in response ?
these are questions worth pondering upon .
pressure brought to china by the us economic recession .
the united states is the powerhouse of the world economy and the largest international market .
the usd$ 800 - billion annual trade deficit indicates global exports are heavily dependent on the us .
the us is our no. 2 trade partner , no. 1 export market , no. 6 import source , and no. 3 technology import source . china 's total export value was usd $ 875 billion from january to november 2006 , of which 21 % was export to the us . plus the portion re-exported from hong kong , export to the us accounted for over 35 percent of the total chinese export value .
export of chinese shipping , low - end electronics , furniture , textiles and artware could all be affected should the us experience economic recession .
in addition , other developing countries in asia are major suppliers in the supply chain centered around china , and the supply chain is driven by the us demand .
as a result , slowdown of the us economy represents a huge pressure for the entire asia .
some expect that china 's export growth rate will decrease from 23 percent to 15 percent in 2007 .
if the government sit by and watch , the chinese economic growth rate will drop 3 - 4 percent .
china is fully capable of withstanding the impacts .
regardless of the accuracy of various comments , china must be prepared to cope with the us economic recession .
although some predictions are a little sensational , the author believes the us economic recession this time will not be very severe , with less impacts on china than other countries .
by taking some proactive measures , the chinese economy is fully capable of withstanding such impacts .
from the current situation , strong domestic investment within china has fully compensated the impact of the decrease in net export .
the appreciation of rmb has not affected export either , and the decrease in volume due to higher prices is offset by increased prices .
raw materials imported take a large percentage in the costs of the chinese exports . the appreciation of rmb could , in the first place , lower costs .
additionally , in the long term , rmb slowly edging up can encourage firms to use advanced international technology and resources .
the government may support export , especially technological upgrade of exports , by such ways as increasing export rebates , adopting quicker depreciation , removing the super-national treatment to foreign investments .
it can be expected that neither the appreciation of rmb nor the global economic recession will seriously impact chinese export .
it would be exaggerating to say china is 70 percent dependent on foreign trade .
the statistics has underestimated china 's gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- , especially that of the tertiary sector .
converting to us dollar at the exchange rate has also underestimated china 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
as more than half of the chinese foreign trade is processing trade , it would be overestimating the total foreign trade to count import and export repeatedly .
the author estimates that our country actually might be 40 percent dependent on foreign trade .
therefore , there is no need to magnify china 's dependence on export to the us .
export - oriented economic growth of china should be cooled down , while the role of domestic demand and import should be promoted .
our economic growth relies primarily on the domestic market and should be increasingly dependent on the domestic market .
if factors such as the rapid development of the tertiary sector and the appreciation of rmb are taken into consideration , china 's dependence on foreign trade can be controlled at around 50 percent in the long run .
long - term export of chinese products at low prices will lead to " impoverished wealth growth , " and we should specially understand the " wealth " as domestic environmental resources .
foreign - funded processing export consumes domestic electricity and water resources substantially .
the environmental costs in our country account for approximately 30 percent of product costs , but are not incorporated into product prices . and this is the primary reason why chinese products are cheap .
it is imperative to remove the environmental subsidies to domestic and foreign consumers , internalize external environmental costs of chinese products as soon as possible , and increase the prices of most products , including exports , in order to alleviate international trade frictions , reduce the pressure for rmb appreciation , and in particular change the prospect that the chinese environmental resources will seriously deteriorate .
in addition , the chinese population is huge and young , which enables the chinese economy to enjoy the " population dividends . " however , the percentage of savings is astoundingly high , and according to the hypothesis of macroeconomic balance where savings equal investments , the huge investments have become the source of high - speed economic development .
however , to depress the consumption rate to lower than 40 percent will certainly lead to overproduction , and cheap goods will in turn impact the international market .
if the us economic recession would indeed affect our export , it would not necessarily be a bad thing in the author 's view . in a sense , domestic demand will not increase unless export decreases .
over the last 20 years , the world has experienced many economic crashes , affecting countries or regions such as russia , arab , latin america and east asia . the us also suffered stock market crash in 2001 . china is the only one to realize economic emergence for the largest population in the history .
whenever there is an international economic recession , china would actively expand domestic demand to create market for different countries .
in fact , china has long been a responsible big nation , playing a stabilizing role to the international society .
external pressure is an opportunity for internal restructuring .
long - term high - speed growth in china has led to significant wealth growth , as well as different kinds of disequilibriums , such as : too much savings and investments and insufficient consumptions ; heavy investment in infrastructure and manufacturing , and insufficient investment in national defense , science and technology , education , health , environment and national reserves ; wider income gap , regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas ; the economy has become dependent on the us market to some extent due to long - term export orientation and trade surplus to the united states ; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting , so on and so forth .
by now , high - speed growth of the chinese economy has entered the final acceleration period that will span over a decade .
beginning 2007 , the economic aggregate is expected to increase sharply by 150 percent , leading to the " historical disequilibrium development " predicted by soros . this is also why china is not afraid of a global economic crisis and capable of digesting it .
however , after 2020 , china will be facing the puzzle of population aging , which is sure to witness an economic slowdown .
as an expectation , there will be leading overreactions in financial and real estate areas by around 2015 .
we must complete a series of tasks in this period , including system restructuring , overcoming the financial crisis , improving national defense strength , safeguarding national security , realizing technological upgrade and protecting the environment .
the economic growth in future will be realized primarily through technological advancement and social harmony .
within these years , the sharply grown wealth of rmb? 40 trillion shall be used effectively in areas including national defense , science and technology , environment , national soil renovation , and adjusting social relations .
it wo n't do to rely solely on the market mechanism and economic strength . to realize , there should also be a correct strategy , relying upon the comprehensive strength of the culture , the nation and the society .
various disequilibriums in the rapid growth of china must be adjusted .
from this perspective , the us economic recession imposes external pressure on the economic restructuring , which is also an opportunity .
whether the impacts brought to china by the us economic recession can be resisted and the impacts on the world economy can be alleviated hinge on whether or not china can truly expand its domestic demand . the next few years may see the chinese economy cooling down , a continuous modest rise in rmb , a slowdown in the speed and volume of export growth , a possible decrease in trade surplus , and speculative capital and the real estate bubble in control , which are adjustments from disequilibriums to equilibriums in the economic relations between china and the united states and between china and the world , as well as in the social relations within china .

half of the japanese people are descendants of the han race -lrb- proved by modern genetics -rrb- , and they inherited their culture from us as well . more or less they can somehow talk practically and realistically .
before the year n , most koreans were the descendants of northwestern nomads ; they were pressured by the han for n years , and they bear animosity .
if in those years the " great east asian circle of common glory " is unfortunately achieved , it should be a bit more bearable than in the qing dynasty when the manchus shaved our heads .
for the long - term , if we let the descendants of the overseas han come to force the great east asian circle of glory , it wo n't be as good as if we make it happen ourselves .
then we 'll send troops to be stationed in korea and follow the system of the manchus from those times , setting up a frankpledge system , with the bride spending her wedding night with the lord of the frankpledge .
restoring those olden days will ensure that everybody on the korean peninsula is a descendant of the han race , ^_^ .

thoughts on ethnic conflict and the policy of consideration for minorities

topic : thoughts on ethnic conflict and the policy of consideration for minorities
posting station : bbs unnamed space station -lrb- mon jan 29 14:57:49 2007 -rrb- , at the station .
this article was originally written in response to a muslim club question ; if its tone is excessive in spots , please excuse .
what you said is right : many of these are individual clashes .
it is very difficult for one person 's ethnic or religious status to shape a person 's behavior .
if one individual in an ethnic group or religion does something bad , you can only say that that person 's character has an essentially evil side to it .
if he does good , then certainly a large part of his character is good .
if we reverse this logic , no religion or ethnic group in the world is without blame .
the han have a longer history than the hui and a greater population ; who knows how many clashes there have been historically with the peripheral minorities ?
so can we say that the han are such and such ?
with regard to certain clashes involving local ethnic groups or territories , it does n't say anything about whether that ethnic group is bad or good ; rather it 's a tragedy brought on by a sort of " security crisis " and " misinterpreted information . "
most of all , it 's basically a matter of the political system and of trust .
regardless of whether it 's the han or the hui , when friction first crops up , their lack of faith in the government and law -lrb- this is a characteristic of many autarchies -rrb- makes people believe that the government can not fairly and effectively handle the situation .
this gives both sides the illusion they 're in a state of anarchy .
more often than not they resort to using the strength of their own villages or ethnic group to protect their security .
this " civic conflict " gets turned into an " ethnic conflict . "
and when one side mobilizes its own village to respond to the security threat -lrb- not just physical safety but also moral safety - protecting their own way of life -rrb- that they see as coming from another village , the other side obviously will not stand idly by but will also mobilize and prepare .
in this way the impressions of the first group will be validated , and so on , with both sides falling into the vicious cycle of " security crisis " just as when a war breaks out in international politics ; the clash is unavoidable .
add to this the fact that both sides include some people who , because they have been regularly bullied , or the village headman or sheikh wants to use this as an opportunity to gain some political advantage and increase his own influence , seizing the chance to fan the flames and inciting people to fight .
some governments -lrb- the manchu qing -rrb- even adopted a policy of " using the barbarians to control the barbarians , " stirring up conflict , using the hui to control the han and the han to control the hui .
there are some people who make an uproar over hui - han clashes who take a one - sided view ; they see only the clash , but they overlook how many times these types of clashes have been settled , how many times there has been cooperation between the two groups .
some people claim to be involved in academic research , then the first thing that should be done is to list all the interactions between the two groups in history and in the present : clashes , peaceful coexistence , cooperation .
in this way you get at least three variables , and only then can you analyze the causal relationship .
some people 's resulting variables do not change , or there is only one value : clashes . what kind of " scientific research " result can people like this achieve ?
changes in variables should also be considered in terms of consideration .
you look at the many policies of minority consideration , but you should also look at how , in a majority - han society , in a society that stresses uniformity and looks down on individuality , there are just as many mechanisms and opportunities for discrimination against minorities , if not more .
did you know that in interviews some people are rejected just because they have a northwest accent ?
do you know how distressed muslims are in a unit or company where there is no halal canteen ?
have you ever heard a mongol father cry because his son has to start studying chinese in first grade ?
do you understand how development of the west has plundered so many resources and left the local minorities just as needy as they ever were ?
this lack of consideration is most often not obvious , but it is everywhere .
of course these forms of discrimination very seldom come from the whole " han race " as an abstract ; most often they come from the system - a form of ethnic rule that combines centralized authority + representatives of local minorities .
it can not be denied ; minorities have many faults as well .
however , the vast majority of the people at the lower levels of society are blameless , just as the vast majority of our han compatriots at the lower levels of society are blameless .
those who should be blamed are the cadres in the upper echelons of the party , the so - called ethnic cadres and the influential capitalists in league with them .
in the past when the local tyrants and despots among the minorities were overthrown , the masses of minorities and the han were equally happy .
but today they find that the cadres and capitalists from those years are now standing together , and the han people of the same class from those years are beginning to suppress them .
of course some people say that the communist party and most han cadres have made many contributions to the construction of border and minority areas , and have sacrificed so much .
right , the minorities should be grateful and remember the contributions of the han cadres , and this proves that any two ethnic groups can live peacefully together .
however , it can also be said that the party and the country have a duty to provide basic infrastructure and improve economic development ,
because since you govern this land , and you collect taxes , do you really want to wipe your ass and leave ?
more importantly , the so - called " preferential policy " can only be given by a powerful ethnic group or force .
this should be common knowledge - the people who can give are always higher - ups .
and the weaker ethnic groups can only accept it passively .
but let 's not mention on what basis the communist party divided 55 ethnic groups into " minorities " !!??
the essence of our party 's ethnic preferential policies is to permanently institute this strong - weak relationship between the han race and its fraternal ethnic groups -lrb- the relationship between the center and the fringe , the governing and the governed .
let the han race -lrb- mainly meaning the inner bureaucracy -rrb- act like the emperor , doling out to the " minority " here and there .
and the " minorities " can only feel deeply grateful , how will they dare discuss equality !!
people who are given consideration are in mainstream eyes the weak ; as time goes by , the " minorities " who are given consideration also get accustomed to this arrangement and believe that they are the weak ones and should be dominated , as if they were inferior !!!!
do n't you see it , but whenever there is some event like national day or may first , all the ethnic groups get together in tiananmen square , and people dress as " minorities , " wear their costumes , their traditional folk dress , even if they have never worn such outfits in their daily lives .
while the han leaders and representatives are wearing western suits and leather shoes .
what does this explain ?
it perfectly reflects this strong - weak relationship : the han are contemporary , and the minorities are backward , stuck in the past and abnormal !!!!
this is the price to pay for being considered !!!
what need is even there to talk of abuse !!??
all ethnic groups have been enslaved . what else is there ?
the result of receiving consideration is the degeneration of these ethnic groups , with no hope of progress . do n't we really know where those people got their sour grapes ?

ding yunhong , who came from mainland china and then immigrated to windsor , ontario , by way of the us , will attend the public hearing for judgment on his accusation of the federal government at 10:00 a.m. next monday -lrb- january 8 -rrb- at the federal appeal court in toronto .
during ding yunhong 's application for citizenship , a cic official accused him of violating the law such as going to the us without notification , failing to report children upon landing , and attending school while collecting unemployment benefits .
ding yunhong gave explanations and responses to these accusations one by one , believing that this government official 's abuse of power had constituted infringement of his rights protected by the canadian constitution and laws .
after filing complaints with cic several times with no results , ding yunhong filed a complaint against the canadian government with the federal court in toronto on july 22 , 2004 .
after receiving the complaint , the civil court prosecuted the case on october 1 , 2004 . on december 3 of the same year , ding yunhong became a canadian citizen . however , he believed he had suffered enough humiliation and damage during the application process and therefore further filed his complaint with the federal appeal court to demand justice .
he said that getting involved in the lawsuit with the government and court had subjected him and his family to tremendous pains and that he had suffered long - term depression because of that , but he could not do nothing for any injustice and discrimination imposed on him and will continue to fight .

zt han han : car knowledge and manifestation of life -lrb- regarding the car accident involving that beautiful/talented taiwanese girl -rrb-

a few days ago , another taiwanese star passed away .
i had never heard of her . i hear she was a talented beauty . what a great pity !
the accident was a car crash .
much of the entertainment news denounced that +her car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused the death .
in fact , the mini cooper she was riding in is not what the reports said . it is the car with the highest safety index . it is sold for 190,000 hk dollars in hong kong .
polo also sells for more than 140,000 hk dollars . it 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls .
but safety is surely not too big of a problem . the collision happened on the side and rear .
so , the side airbag and air curtain were fully opened .
they opened at the time of first collision with the protective fence .
the first collision was with the protective fence only , and the impact on the people was very small .
in addition , there was the protection of the air curtain .
so , there would surely not be a big problem .
the real fatal collision was the second one from the tailgating truck .
at that time , all the airbags were already deflated . there was no protective effect . furthermore , the force of this one was extremely large .
if the car had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the b column .
meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side .
this is common knowledge .
then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of the car that was angled out . it was perfectly correct for the front airbag not to open , because the front of the car was not damaged at all .
none of the sensors received any signal of a collision . just imagine , this was a rear collision . the people went backward abruptly . their bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on their necks and heads was tremendous .
when they went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of the front airbag opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival .
so , of all the cars in the world , even a rolls - royce , the front airbag will not open during a rear collision .
if the front airbag opened after being tailgated , that would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous .
the safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .
so , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat .
that was how the whole accident took place .
the result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .
for this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage .
the car and the car manufacturer have no fault . all of the car 's passive safety protections had already fully carried out their functions . so , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect the car and the car manufacturer for such an accident .
in particular , speculation about why the front airbags did not open was very amateurish .
only by not opening would it have been correct . if they had opened , her assistant might still be lying in the hospital .
if an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move .
many freeway accidents occur simply because people stay inside the car and sort out their thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind .
about death , i have always believed that they do not leave the world . they only leave the human world .
they are surely sharing the same world with us , with a different manifestation of life .

low - cost flying ; the chunqiu airline experience .
vox
the country 's first civilian - operated airline is headquartered in shanghai .
the first impression is that the english name is too vulgar , china-sss.com , would anybody be interested in putting this company 's announcement on jay leno ?
i heard people saying the ticket prices are cheap . then i went online and looked ; there are a and b classes , but no first - class cabin .
every day a certain number of specially priced seats can be reserved only online .
the ticket prices are certainly the cheapest .
chunqiu is encouraging online booking with a 30 - yuan discount , which saves on costs .
but paying online in china is extremely complicated ; that 's another story .
the baggage limit is 15 kg , but i see lots of people whose baggage are definitely over that .
i did n't see complete data online for their flight safety record .
the a320 model is one commonly used only on minor routes .
the planes are not as old as the same models in the u. s.
signs say the life vests are under the seats , but in fact under the seats it 's absolutely empty .
someone next to me asked the flight attendant , and she was unable to answer .
a male flight attendant then said there were no life vests .
after i got back to the states i hitched a ride on a plane of the same model , and the signs said the seat padding could be used as a flotation device . that must be correct .
on board , aside from a small bottle of water , no beverages were offered , but they were selling boxed meals , all of them with the same packaging , for ￥28 a box .
there were also soy - sauce eggs , preserved eggs , peanuts and other snacks .
i do not feel that this is a good approach on brief short - haul passenger flights .
first , they have to remember the passenger 's order and seat number , collect the money -lrb- and check for counterfeits -rrb- . then heat the meal , deliver the meal ... there 's more than just one type of meal , and the preparation is n't always simple .
it 's all helter - skelter enough . many people were still eating just before the plane landed .
plus they also enthusiastically peddle gifts to earn extra income . such as model airplanes , dolls ...
i saw one person pay 200 for a model airplane .
in order to reduce the number of empty seats , the plane even has passengers going to different destinations ; after the plane landed at shanghai , those people stayed on the plane and waited for the cabin to be cleaned and tidied , and only after new passengers were boarded did they continue on their way .
after we landed at shanghai , an airport bus transferred us ; they did n't use the bridge . they said this was another cost - saving measure .
in short , the plane was on time , the baggage was delivered quickly , and the service was ok . this kind of train - like business approach is rather unusual .

posting station : bbs unnamed space station -lrb- wed jan 24 00:42:30 2007 -rrb- .
this anti-cui " movement " made me think of the past .
when i was in junior high school , a man who lived nearby died ; i do n't know why , but rumors started flying , everybody said his wife murdered him .
the two of them had been together for many years , and at the time their two children were older than i was .
this man was very honest , and the woman had always been very sociable , and even though the medical examiner had already examined the body , i do n't know where all this talk came from , but the man 's family insisted on reopening the casket and re-examining it .
this affair stirred up quite a hubbub in our little town .
my mom , too , just kept discussing it on and on .
to my mind it was totally uninteresting , i just felt these middle - aged women were extremely suspicious , and i could n't see what all the fuss was over that woman .
then one day my mom was at the table , the saliva spraying , and i just could n't stand it anymore .
mom , do n't keep repeating what other people say , ok ? you say somebody killed somebody ; what proof do you have ?
my mom rapped her chopsticks on the table : you 're just a kid , what do you know ?
there are no waves without wind ; if this were nothing , people would n't be talking about it so much .
i did n't dare answer the old lady back , but i thought to myself : just wait and see , wait until this woman has been proven innocent , then you wo n't have anything to say .
this woman was really quite a character ; not only was she on good terms with some of the bigwigs at the plant , she was also quite familiar with the head of the city 's public security bureau , who had been transferred over temporarily from the plant .
the matter of whether to open the casket dragged on and on , and finally , because the pressure from public opinion was so great , they re-examined the body , and the result was poisoning .
when that came out , everybody was in an uproar .
to calm the public , finally there was a trial , and the woman was found guilty of murdering her husband .
everybody felt that , in such a case , she would certainly get the death penalty , but she was given a stay of execution .
after several years , the head of the city 's public security bureau became head of the provincial public security department , and then some people said that again this woman might show up in the provincial capital .
i think that if the world did not have " wretched men " who waste endless time tangled up in this sort of thing like cui 's , or " big - mouthed women " like my mother , people like them , who i feel have always been good at certain things , then people would be able to get away with murder or other crimes .

i am not sure if cui fucked a minor .
if he was my friend , i will most probably avoid contacting him until he cleans it off . people have bottom lines after all .
some things are absolutely unacceptable , like murder , like fucking a minor .
when i was back in china this year , i tutored little girls at two relatives homes , feeling 14 - 17 is a very dangerous age group for girls .
you can see clearly how she considers problems , and she easily opens up her thoughts and emotions to you , .
where the worst is she thinks she understands everything .
only rascals would harm these people .
you will understand what i mean if you have a daughter .
there are something that i will never understand , for example having sexual impulse for girls between 14 and 17 .
it only makes me feel funny and concerned to know their various naive and innocent thoughts , as well as their virtually groundless admiration for and trust in you .
who will harm these people ?
when i just met my wife , she was a volunteer at some women 's organizations .
i also went for help and met a lot of single mothers discarded , or even tortured by men .
many ideas have changed .
people can be very bad , while simultaneously they are decent lawyers , doctors , professors and engineers .
many people/matters make you hard to believe . some people are just like the colleagues and teachers around you , but they have done very contemptible things , which could be said even worse than beasts .
in the past , i always thought many laws and regulations were ridiculous in the united states , but i feel they are quite reasonable after experiencing these .
in order to protect the weak , it is necessary for the powerful to sacrifice some interests or conveniences .
after all , the so - called " sacrifices " are no big deal , while the disasters endured by the weak are much heavier .
please guard your moral bottom line , even if you do not have a teenage daughter .

at present , chinese in the us are already an underrepresented group among the underrepresented groups .
their actual power is far less than indians ' .
chinese people 's influence on the us politics and society is almost zero .
it can be said that they are typically subject to excessive humiliation -lrb- i did n't misuse the word , well - known us media can openly humiliate chinese without having to worry about consequences -rrb- .
under such circumstances , these self - proclaimed , so - called elites , graduates of china 's " famous " universities -lrb- note , i mean china 's , there are n't many of those braggarts attending the famous us universities in which their departments are the top ten -rrb- , instead of thinking about how to get united , are getting themselves disabled first .
assuming that you have achieved the best you have wanted , with only students from your respectful universities left in the us , what would be the result ?
could things exist with their foundation gone ?
i guess your days would be also numbered .
indians are waiting to reap profits from your conflict .
if you think i am exaggerating things to scare people , then shut up . no more wasting your own and other people 's time out of boredom .
be a student , or a researcher , what ultimately counts is the vision .
nobel prizes are not given to highest scorers on the college entrance exams , but to those who can clearly point the direction in their chosen field .
playing little clever tricks on minor issues , but blinded to major issues by trifles are not considered to be elites .
elites at least should " not be muddle - headed in major affairs . "
those who want to use abusive words , continue to do so . even if i would be drowned in your saliva , i still would like to speak for the chinese compatriots who want to get united .
to put it impolitely , you people and your name will be both gone , while rivers will flow on forever .
in the end , whoever seeks benefits for the chinese people will be respected by all . this is not something that you can get through arguments .

topic : i am grateful to the university of science and technology
posting station : bbs unnamed space station -lrb- tue jan 2 12:18:26 2007 -rrb- , forward .
everybody has their own reasons for choosing a university ; because the cost of living in hefei is cheaper , and i did n't want my parents to spend all their money , i chose the university of science and technology of china .
years later , looking back on this choice , i certainly do not have any regrets .
perhaps if i 'd chosen two schools in beijing , i would n't be here today talking about how ustc is .
but ustc at the time was weak ; considering location , expenses , promotion and connections , ustc 's greatest wealth was its students .
if we had n't come forward and done something for ustc , it would have been finished .
this is also the main reason ustc students banded together .
because i chose science and technology as my career , i am grateful to ustc for teaching me many things , and i am grateful to the reputation established by the previous president of the university , who enabled those who came after to benefit from it .
precisely because i feel this gratitude , i want to repay ustc . i regularly do my job properly and do not let ustc lose face .
i want to save money out of my meager fellowship to help a poor university student with his living expenses for four years .
i want to go back to china to make my contributions ; i also want to provide the needed help to future students of my university .
when i see people attacking ustc , i sometimes want to take the time to defend it , even though that may not help much .
those ustc haters have their own reasons ; i do n't intend to change their thinking . but with china 's universities being so backward , what contributions have these naysayers really made to their alma maters and their country ?
like gaddy , for example , who first badmouths ustc students for not wanting to contribute money , says he himself has some money , and then wants to spend money filing a lawsuit because of a dispute over personal feelings on the bbs .
this hater really has some problems of his own .
after graduating , i will go back ; no matter where i work , i 'm still a ustc student , and i have no regrets about ustc and no regrets about my country .

i am also a ustc student , but everybody has studied abroad ; there 's no need to divide up into groups and quarrel all the time .
chinese people love to beat up on chinese people .
i love ustc , i love china .
without the fatherland , there 'd be no ustc -lrb- or your university -rrb- ; without ustc -lrb- or your university -rrb- , there 'd be no me now .

select and buy according to the following : .
internal support characteristics .
multidirectional movement during aerobic exercise requires extremely solid shoes .
each manufacturer provides different internal support characteristics .
some manufacturers use a molded midsole , so that the foot can land just right inside the shoe ; fibers going all around the shoes can also provide support .
in order to increase shoe flexibility , some manufacturers add a fiberboard padding only at the heel .
external support .
a firm , resistant heel support can greatly reduce heel displacement .
the wider part of the outsole is called the heel fixed strip .
it is made of plastic and spreads all the way around the foot , attached to the heel support .
many shoes now use a fixed frame ; the fixed frame is a polymer part that is used as support and is distributed longitudinally around the outside of the shoe .
other stability characteristics include a plastic support strip -lrb- generally connected to the eyelets -rrb- , velcro hook , middle uppers can also provide side support characteristics .
shock absorption .
repeated impacts during aerobic exercise produces unique pressures that generally correspond to five times your body weight .
therefore good shock - absorbing performance is essential .
the midsole helps to disperse these impacts .
a good midsole is made from extruded eva or polyurethane .
the various manufacturers have come up with various technologies to further increase the midsole 's shock absorption .
if you are someone with insufficient downward tilting , or engage in intense exercise , you may require greater shock absorption than people with excess downward tilting .
replaceable insoles .
the insole also has a certain shock - absorbing function , but at the same time it is the easiest to ruin .
as for replacing the insole when the shoe is halfway through its life , there is a basic principle involved ; after 150 hours of aerobic exercise , the insole may lose its bounce , and this is when it should be replaced . -lrb- this varies according to the person and the type of training . -rrb-
elasticity .
a shoe 's elasticity is determined by how you feel when your feet move .
shoes with just a fiberboard pad at the heel have better flexibility than athletic shoes using a complete fiberboard design . athletic shoes with low uppers can also improve flexibility .
fit .
your feet may swell when they are under pressure and engaging in aerobic exercise .
the heat produced by intense exercise may cause the feet to swell by half a size .
at the same time , when you buy shoes they should not be too tight ; there should be a space as wide as a thumbnail between the tip of the shoe and your longest toe to ensure that your toes can move freely , and it should fit properly at the heel .
in addition , you should regularly measure the length of your feet , because increasing age and injuries can change the size of your feet .

i reckon this refers to domestically produced shoes . but after you add an insole , the impact on the knee joints is much less .
the kind of heel insoles on the wal - mart pharmacy shelves are ok .

i have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since i knew it could claim my life if i abruptly go to clean my teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned .
after my still upright but " left - tilting " teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after i graduated and found a job .
the revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.
the incident was caused by a molar .
the location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my first visit to an american dentist .
for some unknown reason , when i was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful .
unexpected i heard a " crack " while i was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !.
i could not remember eating anything hard ?!.
i rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !.
i did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy . it was after i began to receive it that i found it really painful !.
for example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ...
i asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .
after examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other .
the wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth .
i asked what solutions are available ?
the dentist said " correction . "
thus , three years after i ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " i stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ...

do cpa's in the us make a good living ?
i used to work for an accounting firm in china .
it 's not a big city , but i always thought the job i had was not as hard as others imagine .
perhaps that 's because people before me had long established a set of models .
i 'd like to ask those who have passed cpa exams in the us whether you are making a good living .
it 's also very hard for me to pass the cpa exams in china .
and now in the us , i may find an average school to study for a master 's degree , and then , and then do i have to start preparing for cpa exams here too ?
also , in china cpa and certified tax agents are separate .
in the us , are there exams for certified tax agents ?
is the work of tax agents done by accounting firms as well in the us ?
be your own psychiatrist .
li xu .
in today 's society , fierce competition , cultural conflicts and material temptation disturb our minds incessantly , which often make us feel worried , anxious , upset and furious .
people also try to adjust themselves in material ways , but those often fail to work : exercises can not lessen the concerns at heart ; physical and mental fatigue persist not long after traveling ; the soft water bed can not bring comfortable sleeps ; and the luxurious room can not dispel the disputes of spouses .
that 's why someone proposes that modern people learn a new survival skill -- learn to be your own psychiatrist , helping yourself to dissolve all sorts of metal stresses at work and in life .
be your own psychiatrist , simply put , is to improve your ability adjust yourself psychologically .
to elaborate , it means there should be a special role in your mind who possesses " the third eye " mentally to observe your emotional changes sensibly and find out the reasons for mental disturbances .
it is just like the " guardian angel " whom everyone has in western legends , who gives you wisdom at critical moments and help you deal with the intricate reality properly , so that you will not lose direction .
there was a famous british psychologist named ellis in the last century , who encouraged people to learn a special , reasonable and healthy way of thinking by reading professional books , organizing group discussions and doing specific training in thinking , in order to deal with emotional problems caused by stresses .
he should be the first one to advocate " learn to be your own psychiatrist . "
he encourages people to learn a new way of thinking like " learning a foreign language . "
the most important aspect in being your own psychiatrist is to learn to substitute the healthy way of thinking for the unhealthy way of thinking .
for example , ask two people to observe the same glass , if one notices a tiny speckle and the other notices the mild color , then the former 's thinking pattern might be pessimistic , while the latter might be more sensitive to the positive aspect of things , which is a healthy and optimistic way of thinking .
thus , learn to observe the positive aspect of things has become an important training .
to be your own psychiatrist , you should also learn to observe stress - related signs .
for example , if you have a stomachache , your normal response is to see a gastroenterologist .
through observation by " the third eye , " you may see that the reason can be your new demanding boss .
to be your own psychiatrist , you also need to learn appropriate knowledge .
there was a student at the tsinghua university , who were troubled by " depression " for a while .
when it was bad , he wanted to jump out and commit suicide at the sight of a window .
with some psychological knowledge , he knew it was a symptom of mental disorder , so he immediately sought help from professionals and received treatment soon .
now in many european and american countries , some intellectuals including young college students like to read psychological books .
psychological books can always be seen in the best seller lists in these countries . most readers do not aim to become counsellors , but to learn psychological knowledge to help personal growth .
such healthy awareness is worth learning .

zt discount stamps and sheetlets : where do they come from ? where do they go ?
discount stamps are sets and sheetlets of stamps that are currently discounted .
this is the biggest category of stamps .
it has a large number , great variety , and large face value .
that is , it 's a big category .
precisely how big it is , i 'm afraid no - one knows .
because this category has an objective existence , no - one can ignore it . its trends are extremely important . it is the biggest category for collectors and has the largest influence on the stamp market .
when it rises , this indicates that stamps are gaining as a whole .
its strength and weakness is the barometer of postal policy , the thermometer for the temperature of the market .
if there is no comprehensive rise and gains at the bottom in the category of discount stamps , then any upsurge is a castle in the air , the moon in the water .
its foundations will not be solid . only when this category is handled well can the stamp market have any hope of surging up out of its slump and heading for a beautiful future . where do discount sheets come from ?
●the postal service sells them at a discount : a few years ago the postal service sold large quantities of stamps at low prices , violating pricing rules and stamp collecting rules . it dumped discount stamps onto the stamp market on a large scale , making 50 - yuan sheets , 8 - yuan sheets and 5 - yuan sheets fall far below their own face value and the discounting of stamp sets even deeper .
this is the first source .
●stamp collectors cashing out : the number of stamp collectors in our country reached a peak in 1997 .
according to estimates , there were approximately more than 27 million stamp collectors at that time .
to meet the stamp collecting demand from the great numbers of philatelists , the postal administration printed large numbers of stamp sets and sheetlets , based on the number of people who ordered stamps at that time .
in the last few years , for a variety of reasons , a large number of stamp collectors have been lost and no longer collect stamps .
in order to cash out , these people dumped the 1992 - 2005 stamps that they had collected onto the market in large volumes , causing supply to exceed demand .
this is the second source .
● sell - offs by big collectors : in the stamp speculation in 1997 , quite a few large collectors having financial resources also bought back their stamp sheets from this period as short - term investments . now in order to cash out , they are also dumping them on the markets at a loss .
this is the third source .
● underused : these stamps have been underused over the past few years , forming a large reserve in the market .
when the stamps were at their most discounted , a 50 - yuan sheetlet was 10 yuan , about 80 % off ; an 8 - yuan sheetlet was 2.4 yuan , about 70 % off ; and a 5 - yuan sheetlet was 1.8 yuan , about 64 % off .
the discounts were even deeper on stamp sets , though they might not be sold even at these discounts .
this is the fourth source .
● oversupply of new stamps : it is well known that for many years the number of new stamps released has been very large . everyone knows this , so there is no need to make further comment .
this is the fifth source .
over the last ten - plus years , discounted sheets of stamps have been like ghosts , floating back and forth in the airspace over the stamp market , and among stamp dealers .
they are traded back and forth , but never disappear .
they are such an inexplicable embarrassment .
but to take a materialist view of them , their existence is a fact , and we should be sure not to ignore them .
and if we ask how to get rid of discount stamps ?
some say that those who make a mess should clean it up . i think that wherever they came from , that 's where they should go back to .
■ use them up : public service departments should make serving the people their highest aim . they should address all the issues raised by npc deputy yang xianlong in his proposal concerning stamps , and should act in good faith in their work . good policies and good approaches will certainly bring good results and good returns .
the difficulty of using stamps for the general public is a major sticking point .
for historical reasons , the discounting of stamps has been widespread , with deep discount rates and long duration .
if these stamps are not permitted to be used , this is sure to harm the interests of the owners of the stamps ; if they are permitted to be used , then there will be a certain effect on the current revenues of the postal service .
it seems to be a contradiction not easy to resolve .
in fact , the newly - established china post group only needs to consider the big picture , to think about the future , to increase the rate at which stamps are used .
to further improve the postal reforms , the state post bureau should improve its supervision of postal services .
cpg should operate under supervision , and there should be no more violation of regulations .
this is the first way to get rid of them .
■ collect them all : first , increase the number of stamp collectors by encouraging new people to join in stamp collecting .
second , at all levels , all over the country , organize specific philatelic events that are conducive to a healthy body and mind and conducive to improving people 's temperament .
third , increase guidance to stamp collectors ' associations in their work .
fourth , promote philatelic culture on all fronts , bring stamp collecting events into schools , into villages , into factories , into army bases , into residential communities , and into the homes of millions .
if old friends return and new people also join in , and the number of stamp collectors again reaches 15 million or more , then we are honestly a little doubtful whether these few stamps will be enough for everyone to share .
if there are n't enough for everyone to share , then the price of stamps will naturally rise .
this would then naturally solve the problem of discounted stamps .
this is the second way to get rid of them .
■buy them back : there are two buy - back methods : one is a policy buy - back , which is the postal service dealing with discount stamps -lrb- at least important stamps -rrb- with a state buy - back .
at present this seems to be rather difficult . second is a market buy - back , using the lever of market economy . this takes the stamps bought at bottom discount rates on the market and sells them again to the public to use on correspondence , speeding up the use of discount stamps .
this involves the restructured postal administration taking part in market operations , reducing the pressure of discount stamps .
after a period of operation , this problem can be solved very effectively .
this approach can be considered quite a realistic method .
this is the third way to get rid of them .
■controlling the source : first is that you absolutely can not think that because the price of stamps is heading back towards their value , because the price has risen a little , another opportunity for dumping stamps at low prices has come , and again start playing tricks with overprints .
this is the limit of good faith , you absolutely must not , oh , this is a must .
from the facts that this year 's year stamps are not being discounted , and the rate of discount on discounted stamps in the market has reduced significantly , it is enough to show that the postal policies are already starting to have an effect .
only in this way will the numbers of stamps on the market start to decrease , and stamps move onto a healthy path of appreciation .
when stamps have risen in value to a certain degree , even if you ask someone to , he wo n't use stamps that are worth more than their face value as postage .
the more stamps appreciate , the fewer stamps will surely be used as postage .
this reasoning is obvious . second is using the scientific approach to development to decide the quantities of stamps distributed .
when the quantity of stamps distributed is large or too great , the practice of stamp collecting is damaged . the number of stamp collectors is then greatly reduced . this has been proved by past events .
the quantities distributed of new stamps must be appropriate for the actual situation . too many is no good ; too few is no good either .
this is the fourth way to get rid of them .
the destiny of discount stamps is : they came gradually , they 'll go gradually , and despite everything we 'll redouble our speed .
many discoveries are made by chance .

i remember my first year studying at qinghua , i went to my first elective course called " inspirations in the history of physics . "
there were only ten or so of us who had chosen it that semester .
the teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time i was enthralled .
in all my five years at the university , i never had another course that interesting .
if i were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis -lrb- for example , the development of mathematics -rrb- .
this theory can also be applied to cooking .
one day i wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets -lrb- dried tofu in the northeast -rrb- .
here the dried tofu sold in the stores is all compressed , very tough .
so i normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
because that day i needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , i set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .
my wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .
when i came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .
chalk another good one up to the wife .

every morning when we wash face for yaya -lrb- especially when kid 's mother does that -rrb- , yaya would remind us not to use any face wash .
the little one has always remembered what i once said about a tv program , which documented people going to tibet . they would n't wash their faces in the morning in order to retain the grease that coped with the strong sunlight and ultraviolet radiation and would only wash off the dusts with soap at night .

it 's so hard to make a hotel reservation . i do n't know whether it is because of an upcoming big conference , all hotels in the 10 - mile radius from san jose have been booked up . i could only find a sheraton in pleasant about 25 miles from the company . i must make sure to bring my own gps before i set out in case there is no gps in the rental car .
frozen time : leap - year day
frozen time
on the 23rd of the twelfth month of the lunar year , we celebrate leap - year day , and the spring festival is getting closer and closer .
the two of us are busy doing our makeup and our hair .
custom has it that you should not get your hair cut in the first month of the lunar year ,
and before the spring festival there are more people than usual getting their makeup and hair done . abing laughingly allowed me to go on the second day of the second month when the two dragons raise their heads to get my hair cut .
in the evening i had nothing to do , so i decided to look for someone to gamble with .
i called a friend , but he had just moved into a new home .
today for leap - year day his father - and mother - in - law were gathered with his family at his house to make jiaozi , so it appears we ca n't get together for gambling today !
tutu and i went home and ate a great meal , i lit some candles , and the two of us celebrated the holiday .
the custom of paying respects to the kitchen god .
according to traditional custom , every year on the 23rd of the last month of the lunar year , the kitchen god is supposed to ascend to heaven and report to the jade emperor on this home 's good things and bad for the jade emperor to reward or punish .
so when they pray to the kitchen god , people place sweets , fresh water , black beans , and hay on a table in front of the kitchen god 's image ; the last three of these are for the horse that the kitchen god rides to heaven .
on the evening of the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month , you 're supposed to place a tray of candied melon on the table .
this is because you hope the kitchen god will eat his fill of sweets and then " tell good things in heaven and bring good fortune when he returns . "
after you put the candied melon on , you take down the image of the kitchen god that was hung above the stove the previous year and burn it at the side of the stove ; then you wait until the 30th when you put up the spring couplets and hang a new kitchen god in the original place , and you hang up a couplet with the first line saying " ascend to heaven and tell good things " and the second line reading " return and bring good fortune , " and the horizontal saying is " ruler of this home . " then you also put an incense burner there and every time you celebrate a festival you light incense and pray for happiness .
folk custom says that men do not worship the moon and women do not sacrifice to the kitchen god , so it is only the men who make these sacrifices to the kitchen god .
legend .
a long time ago , there was a well - to - do family named zhang ; in middle age , they had a son .
the husband and wife gave their son the name zhang guisheng , and later people called him zhang sheng .
when zhang sheng grew up , he liked to eat , was lazy , and he often went gambling , so the old husband and wife decided to marry him off and let their daughter - in - law manage him . they sent someone to propose this marriage to a comely girl in the village named guo dingxiang .
dingxiang soon came to live with them , but after the marriage zhang sheng 's behavior worsened .
dingxiang persuaded and cajoled , but in the end she was beaten and kicked by zhang sheng .
not long after , the two aggrieved elders passed on .
one day , dingxiang rolled out a bowlful of long , fine noodles and waited for zhang sheng to return to eat , and she took the opportunity to again urge him to change his ways , but zhang sheng pushed the bowl away and left .
after this , zhang sheng threw out dingxiang , sold off the family possessions and land , and spent his days living a life of dissipation .
after being thrown out , dingxiang went to south mountain .
there she spent her days clearing land and planting crops , and in the evening she wove ; after years of arduous toil , she became a wealthy woman with a hundred mu of fine land .
when zhang sheng had sold off all his possessions , he began to beg for a living .
only then did he repent , and he thought of how worthy dingxiang was .
one day , dingxiang saw a beggar enter her courtyard , and she realized it was zhang sheng . good - hearted dingxiang took zhang sheng into the kitchen and with her own hands gave him a bowl , setting it on the table .
zhang sheng saw this bowl of long , thin noodles and knew he had come begging to dingxiang 's home ; feeling ashamed , he smashed his head into the stove and killed himself .
later the jade emperor made him the kitchen god and put him above the stove so he could watch other people eat but not eat himself , and told him that was his punishment .
freezing the moments : days when we are busy gathering .
freezing the moments
seeing the year of the dog going by one day after another and the spring festival approaching , we are busy greeting the advent of the " golden pig " and busy gathering with colleagues , friends and schoolmates .
we two have had no time virtually to have a quiet dinner at home ever since last week . it was often deep night when we were back home ! tutu went to a regular monthly gathering at the club again today .
i learned from his call that many people were there this time and even some of hali 's friends went .
brother jia will go back to germany on friday . they say we should be really high , and it seems god knows when we will be back home !
i can not be idle either and directly went to the department store to enjoy myself !
lysh will be off on his/her home leave from tomorrow and wo n't be back until after the spring festival . he/she can rest for more than a month altogether . how envious i am !
i would laugh to death if i could have such long vacation each year !
guo kai 's economic notes : your uncle is just your uncle .
guo kai 's economic notes
this morning i went to the supermarket with dad , and when it came time to check out i discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
in terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
in fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
in terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories -lrb- here i 'm being inaccurate ; i hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with io expertise -rrb- .
but with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co-workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .
below i am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
so whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : my uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
in other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and i have it .
if americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
i believe that they made such a complete mess of the middle east to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the middle east , which is a completely different place from the united states .
on this issue , china does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; china 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever china does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
therefore i believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
we need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
so just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
when you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .
guo kai 's economics notes : six cachets !
guo kai 's economics notes
i took the subway to meet someone at the railway station today and found a red header document posted everywhere inside the subway station .
a closer look told me it was the notice about public transportation price adjustment in beijing .
i did n't care about the details because the news had been heard for a while .
what attracted me was the six red cachets below the notice , respectively development and reform commission , education commission , social security bureau , financial bureau , traffic commission and transportation administrative bureau .
i know roughly the reason why the cachets of the former four organizations are required .
development and reform commission is the organization in charge of prices .
education commission and social security bureau correspond to the population on whom this policy may have relatively greater impact on .
financial bureau is the organization providing the fund .
i do n't know what kind of organizations traffic commission and transportation administrative bureau are .
i even do n't know why these two organizations are not a single organization - judging from the name , it seems that transportation administrative bureau could be a division of traffic commission definitely .
however , now that the subway does have something to do with traffic and transportation , there is nothing strange with the appearance of the cachets of these two departments .
then , what surprised me ?
when i saw these six cachets , my first reaction is that it is absolutely hopeless to rely on the government itself to control institutional thickening .
there must be a reason for a bloated government .
look , i found out the reason for these six cachets with the slightest effort .
however , i am totally an outlier .
it is much easier for these governmental departments to find an excuse for their existence , is n't it ?
and their excuses are always affirmative , and always for the interests of the common people .
the existence of governmental departments is different from the existence of private institutions .
private institutions spend their own money , and too much expansion will make them suffer loss .
what governmental departments spend is taxpayers ' money . regardless how much is spent , as long as the amount is not ridiculously large , they will never face the risk of loss and closing down
they themselves can find excuses for thickening without worrying about the problem of money .
what kind of excuses governmental institutions have will prevent thickening ?
i can hardly figure it out .
of course , i do n't have any objections against this downward adjustment of public transportation prices , but those six cachets are really too striking .
even i get tired of arguing about tax hikes .
for a change of pace , i invite you to contemplate the hazard posed by that old computer monitor sitting in your basement or the pre-big screen tv collecting dust in your garage .
they contain toxic chemicals --
do n't dump them in the trash !
be responsible and unload them at one of 18 electronics recycling events scheduled in virginia this april .
if landfilled or incinerated , hazardous materials in common electronic products may be released into the soil , air or water .
televisions and computer monitors use cathode ray tubes -lrb- crts -rrb- , each of which contain as much as 8 pounds of lead .
flat screen tvs and monitors contain mercury .
printed circuit boards and switches in electronic devices contain small amounts of chromium , cadmium , mercury and lead .
'' almost seventy - five percent of all obsolete electronics are still stored in offices and homes . this is a great opportunity to get rid of that old pc or vcr that has been collecting dust and know it will be responsibly reused or recycled , '' said computer recycling initiative 's director , carrie dorsey .
click here to find a recycling event near you .
good idea .
i 'd feel a lot better about it if the stuff did n't wind up going to china and being `` recycled '' in a manner that is environmentally unfriendly .
it 's kind of like the oregon soft drink cans .
turns out they were being ground up and turned into substrate for leaching gold : a pretty nast process .
darn , they are n't hitting spotsy .
i 've got two dead monitors taking up space in my office .
jim , on behalf of the virginia recycling markets development council and the mid-atlantic consortium of recycling and economic development officials -lrb- macredo -rrb- , thanks for plugging e-cycling .
such events are becoming more frequent and more convenient to more virginia residents , although based on cod 's comment , we still have a ways to go .
a well - used economic development tool is the incubator , typically an office building that is subdivided and provides subsidized rent and admin services to small business that have outgrown their garage or bedroom , but are too small for leased space .
these incubators typically cater to high tech or `` clean '' service businesses .
i have always thought we should consider setting up recycling `` incubators '' at landfills and transfer stations .
e-waste and construction waste are two potentially profitable steams
and nurturing small recycling businesses might serve both an economic development good and a public good .
a person with a pick - up truck could start such a business pretty easily .
the cost of a trailer or two and a covered space would probably be much less than equivalent office space .
if we stimulated home - grown markets , we might not send so much to china , although i suppose anything we can do to curb the trade deficit might be considered a good thing in some quarters .
that 's right .
i know a guy who gets surplus building materials sorts and resells it .
i 've bought quite a bit from him
and he apparently does a good business .
the business itself is somewhat trashy looking .
it appears that it is located on part of an old family farm ,
and the nearby houses are ones that have been spun off to family memebers .
but if anybody else tried to duplicate it , i ca n't think of anyplace in my county where it would be allowed , or else the requirements would be so onerous it could n't survive .
in my home town , they once built an entire tanker truck for the fire department , out of stuff that came from the dump .
we had really low taxes .
the dump had well organized recycling areas located around the central landfill pit ,
and people had a good eye for things that others might want .
recycling is a really good idea ,
but it is hard to make it pay ,
and it has a waste stream of its own .
what we need to do is to move the recycling process forward into the repair world .
the volkswagen beetle was a terrible car ,
but it was eminently recyclable .
i had one for almost twenty years
and at the end there was n't a single part that was original .
the entire body had been swapped out , the machinery several times , and the running gear many times .
it was still running when i sold it ,
but if vdot ever checked the serial numbers , i do n't know what would happen .
the other thing we need to do is expand the deposit idea .
in addition to having deposits on soft drink bottles , we should have them on appliances , autos and other big ticket items where they can do some good .
the deposit would flow to the recycler who is the final user :
this would make recycling profitable .
he would claim the refund from the manufacturer .
this would ensure that the user of a product pays for its disposal ,
and manufacturers would have an incentive to keep the deposit money as long as possible by building items that can be repaired rather than disposed of .
in the case of foreign manufacturers , the recycling fee would haqve a similar effect as an import duty and could be collected in the same way , but without being called a tariff .
why do some localities charge for the service while others do n't ?
just curious .
because , for the most part , it is a money losing operation , or at most marginal .
recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in the district .
as a political city , they created so much waste product they flooded the market .
if you want to look down the road , think about what is going to happen after we spend a few billion to meet the chesapeake bay waste water restrictions .
where are we going to put all the sludge that results ?
once we stop putting it in the bay , we are going to have to put it on the land .
then we will have regulations to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times .
eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited from running downhill .
coming soon to a farm near you : two month 's worth of stench .
as an engineer and a flinty new englander , and a farmer , i spend a lot of time fixing old junk .
i ca n't stand throwing something away .
maybe some of it comes from growing up on an island where there was no place to throw it .
my father used to say that garbage was like scotch tape .
-lrb- shaking his thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on it . -rrb-
`` you ca n't throw it away ,
you can only stick it someplace else . ''
when i 'm repairing something that was designed so it ca n't be fixed , it makes me crazy .
i want to go find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together .
here are a few examples .
a rototiller with gears made out of free machining brass .
guaranteed to fail .
a windshiel wiper motor installed in a totally inaccessible place under the dash .
it was installed by compressing four little rubber studs into holes in the sheet metal , and sealed with a ten inch oblong flat gasket .
when the rubber studs rotted away , the motor fell on the floor , followed by a torrent of rain that shorted out everything under the dash .
a 1/4 inch diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had to break the tractor in half to replace .
every piece of household plumbing and wiring i ever had to fish through a hollow wall .
anything that can only be repaired upside down .
a twelve bolt circle on a transmission housing with six hex head bolts and six star pattern bolts .
try and figure that out in the dark under the car .
the ignitor for the gas range that costs 25 % of what the range cost .
what 's worse is , that because i 'm good at this , people think i like it .
wrong .
i hate things
and i love flesh .
i 'm convinced that things are inhabited with gremlins .
it 's a vicious circle .
the more stuff you have the more stuff you need to maintain it , like the virginia highways .
it starts with a screwdriver ,
and next thing you know it 's a shopfull of air compressors , saws , welders , a forklift , an earthmover , a dump truck to haul the earthmover .....
my wife takes great glee in making fun of all of this .
then i pointed out all he special purpose tools in her kithchen ,
and that is just for one job .
she carefuly forgets all that when she needs something and it turns out that i have just the right framitz to manufacture a repair piece for her thing - a - bob .
i 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed must be repairable laws .
every engineer should be required to be a mechanic for ten years .
for many of us our life has come down to buy it at wal - mart and take it to the dump .
even if you buy it at the bmw or john deere dealer it is no different .
so , if pec wants to make a supporter out of me , the way to do it is to start a campaign that ensures things do n't have to be thrown away , not one to recycle them at a loss .
i work for e-tech recycling inc -lrb- http://www.etechrecycling.com -rrb- , an electronics recycling company located in virginia .
we recycle all types of electronics items such as computers , monitors , tvs etc.
when i speak with people about the importance of recycling electronic items , they are very ignorant .
i think more than anything , we need to educate people about the importance of recycling .

well , gasoline in richmond has hit $ 3.00 a gallon , or just shy of it ,
and i spent $ 48 filling up the gas tank of my jeep --
the most i 've ever paid for in my life .
i 'm not happy about it ,
but i do n't see high gas prices as a reason to start foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet .
others feel less constrained .
the hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
the economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary i 've seen on national television knows no bounds .
demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
-lrb- 1 -rrb- if you confiscate exxon mobil 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
-lrb- 2 -rrb- if you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
why bother if the profits will be taxed away ? here in virginia , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
gov. timothy m. kaine has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from washington , d.c. .
the governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
which is exactly what he should do .
nothing .
virginians and americans will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
-lrb- the governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in virginia 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
see the times - dispatch report .
unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ 1 billion for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
as i have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog -lrb- see `` a world with one billion cars '' -rrb- , the world economy is moving from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
this shift is driven by the combination of -lrb- a -rrb- escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like china and india , and -lrb- b -rrb- the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
this is not the oil companies ' fault .
this is not dick cheney 's fault .
this is not the auto industries ' fault .
it is not the environmentalists ' fault .
it 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
the american public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
here in virginia , the general assembly has been examining what virginia can do to increase energy production .
that is ok , as far as it goes .
but there is nothing that virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
what the political and business leadership of virginia has so far failed utterly to do is admit that virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
but reality is a stubborn thing .
with each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
let us hope that gov. kaine , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of virginia .
jim - you are right on the money about how capitalism works , so why not try to make capitalism really work for virginia .
the future in transportation belongs to the nation , company or person who develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from virginia ?
rather than drilling for oil and gas off the atlantic coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
you can encourage r&d on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
and , you can work to increase supply .
the one and only oil refinery in the commonwealth is nearby in yorktown .
they could double their capacity without leaving the premises .
why has n't the company applied to builf new facilities on site ?
by all means explore for oil and gas in the atlantic .
jim : speaking seriously here , many families -lrb- including my own -rrb- have already cut back in every way possible .
what then ?
my office , home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius .
vacations are already a thing of the past .
we 've cut back on groceries .
i 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's paid for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and three kids ...
so , i ask seriously , what are average hard - working families to do ?
andrea : how about a couple of hundred dollars ?
if the ga repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
or , the ga could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
check out how much the republican senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.
jim : i like the graphic ,
it takes two arms and two legs to fill up our tank .
the only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle .
that is what an understanding of jane jacobs suggested 40 years ago -lrb- not just in `` life and death ... but also `` the economy of ' cities ' . ''
let us , honor ms. jacobs 's memory with an understanding of the need for fundamental change .
emr
jab - got ta love it .
yup , a couple of hundred dollars is going to save the day !
jane jacobs knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
did n't she fight robert moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
somehow i doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
andrea , one option may be telecommuting a couple of days a week .
other than that , here 's the hard truth :
there 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
what you should not do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
in the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
you should support development patterns that allow compatible uses -lrb- houses , small office buildings , small retail shops -rrb- to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .
how much money could you save if you could get by with only one car instead of two ?
what would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school ?
think outside the box .
kingfish , i 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
i 'd favor government - sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but i do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .
once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .
witness the mohair subsidies put into place during world war ii .
i tend to agree with jim that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
many believe that zone pricing , which is generally used by oil companies , is inconsistent with our antitrust laws -lrb- section 13 of the robinson - patman act -rrb- .
others disagree .
does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
if so , should the ga outlaw zone pricing ?
toomanytaxes : zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .
considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
i was recently on the webpage for the energy information agency and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 per gallon measured in 2005 dollars before .
it is about the historic peak in real prices ,
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
it is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
like you , jim , i see the bright silver lining .
i seem to be getting more questions whenever i pull up in my hybrid .
one data point .
2:53 why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between prince william and fairfax counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
look at arizona , for example . there are much higher transportation costs in and around the grand canyon and much more competition in the phoenix market .
yet , phoenix prices tend to be signficantly higher .
ditto for taxes .
from what i quickly found on the internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are va -lrb- 37.7 cents -rrb- ; utah -lrb- 42.5 cents -rrb- ; nc -lrb- 45.6 cents -rrb- and montana -lrb- 46.2 cents -rrb- .
however , both montana and utah have average prices that are significantly lower than either va or nc .
there 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
i had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an suv
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than 10 miles a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :--rrb-
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` i must and have no choice '' .
it takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
i predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
i know it happened during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but i would bet that folks would choose -lrb- there 's that word again -rrb- $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
america 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though i doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :--rrb-
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
my property accessment going up 300 % -lrb- which it did -rrb- ...
... and today .. i paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 ford van . i got ta talk to ray hyde about that hybrid .... he 's got ..
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :--rrb-
did i really say that ?
that would be a tough `` choice '' .
with the truck i 'd have some chance of making money ,
but i 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
if you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
48 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac .
i remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
i drone on about costs and benefits , but a -rrb- that 's not everything , and b -rrb- sometimes circumstances change .
i 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
i have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
i need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me .
i sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
i do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what i owe ,
but this is going to be whacked .
i suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
that gas station in fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
if people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
btw 13 % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
but prices were down 5k .
time to demand another reassessment .
ray hyde : taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
but i still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

braawwk !
braawwkkk !
it did n't take long .
route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the richmond new urban region , opened in late 2004 .
already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
the richmond times - dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the huguenot trail in powhatan county .
traffic has more than doubled in one section of huguenot trail since 288 opened , reports will jones .
speeding and accidents have surged as well :
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road so far this year , up from 12 for all of 2004 .
dale totten , resident engineer for the virginia department of transportation , noted that vdot would four - lane the road for about $ 13 million if it had more money .
of course , vdot has no more money for road construction in the richmond region .
one reason is that vdot , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin' money on 288 !
where 's homer simpson when you need him ?
this is a major `` d'oh! '' moment .
as we predicted , route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
while the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between chesterfield and goochland counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
the only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
even i thought there might be a lag of three or four years .
if route 288 has already created a $ 13 million road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
here 's another prodiction :
after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega-commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ 400 million it took to build the original highway .
to the brainiacs who thought route 288 was such a great idea :
thanks for nothing .
i think we could have spent the $ 400 million better elsewhere .
i do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people .
if there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
additional traffic congestion in old places ?
now you understand how people like tmt in fairfax feel . i 'd usually take the pro-road position -
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess ...
you have a city , richmond , that has virtually no traffic .
the rush hour is 30 minutes long ...
and you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
a road to no where ...
just think if this money had been spent on another potomac crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in nova ?
virginia centrist , to add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt .
it was very nice of y'all to oblige us .
did n't make much sense , though .
it 's the same old problem .
if you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .
if you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you ca n't pave your way out of congestion .
anonymous -
that 's a fair point .
5:26 makes a good point .
however , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the ctb and vdot fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying .
i submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated .
moreover , senator chichester and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution .
what is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ?
in virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest .
you all are dead wrong .
no less than walter stoch stated that 288 money was intended to be paid from economic development money .
come on folks !!
tmt : i do n't understand your point .
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
it seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
then , of course there is the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
if we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , -lrb- which they will pass to us , of course -rrb- and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
why is it so hard to understand ?
the solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .
all else is spin .
emr
tmt said `` in virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . ''
i do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else .
i think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy , but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the devil .
i do n't see there is any point in claiming as `` a solution '' a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
even you see rail to dulles as a positive because dulles is a job center that promotes bi-directional demand on the rail .
i agree .
in fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
all i 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
they should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
reality check here -
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening .
i commute back and forth to work on the huguenot trail .
i 've never seen anything remotely resembling a `` flood '' of traffic .
it 's a 55 mph zone - 75 to 100 cars in `` a morning '' - over how much time ?
the huguenot trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the chesterfield side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through robious road .
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of powhatan and western chesterfield being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
you may think that 's not rational land use .
i have no desire to live in any city ,
i will not work in a downtown area ,
i will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours ,
and i happen to like large lot development .
how exactly i 'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot is beyond me .
gas could go to $ 10 a gallon
and i 'd still pay to live in the country .
many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them not want to live in an urban core .
this infatuation with city living truly baffles me .
anonymous 6:37 , you have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
but you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a $ 400 million highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
what 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that $ 400 million could have been spent on .
how much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non-road projects .
ray hyde - my comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .
check the following . http://www.nosprawltax.org/media/releases/2002robbery.html and the associated map .
i think that it would be difficult to demonstrate that funding the desired projects illustrated on the map would be the best use of transportation revenues .
even those of us who are isolated from the nova local economy understand the need to have transportation facilities so people can go to and from work .
but that would seem to argue for improving congestion hot spots and not enabling more development .
note that i discuss transportation facilities and not roads .
we need to judge rail by the same engineering and economic standards as pavement .
ok that is a little different from the way i first read it .
but i still think lobbying is ok , both for the developers and for nosprawltax.org .
if it is wrong to look out for our own interests , then we should all shut up and let our officials do the job they were hired to do .
if there is blame to be placed for bad expenditures , let it fall on the officials .
nosprawltax.org and jim bacon are looking out for what they perceive to be their own financial interests , just as the developers are , so arguements based on inflammatory statements about others -lrb- `` speculators '' `` short term profits '' `` windfalls '' , and that sort of thing -rrb- fall on deaf ears to me .
claiming that those financial interests are for the betterment of all does n't improve the argument in the least :
it is the same argument diluted .
with respect to the website you posted , i 'm not impressed .
the site shows a map of land plots that have been assembled by `` developers '' .
it purportedly shows how they would benefit by new roads , most of which already exist , as far as i can tell .
but ask yourself ,
how were those parcels assembled ?
they were purchased from landowners and citizens who were ready and willing to sell at the offered price .
if the smart growth coalition wants to keep `` cars few and open fields aplenty '' they can raise the money and put themselves in the same position the former and present landowners are in .
we have a perfectly legal system for doing just that , and by the way , it is heavily subsidized .
nosrawltax urges taxpayers to reject these new roads .
in doing so they are making enemies out of people like anonymous 6:37 , and several others who have posted here .
in doing so they are also proposing that the costs of keeping those open fields aplenty be absorbed by someone else .
in other words , they want their wishes subsidized by someone else .
that someone else is a taxpayer , and maybe a developer .
they are in exactly the same boat as everyone else :
their assessments and their taxes are going up .
why are they going up ?
because all of the rest of us are not paying our share ,
and because of demand that is not in anyone 's control .
now , the assessments are based on what the land can be sold for on an unbiased exchange .
how can we assess property on that value and then prohibit the sale ?
what nosprawltax.org is suggesting is that we bias the exchange .
if we do that , then we destroy the basis for making the assessment .
say the land was taxed only as its value for growing crops .
that value is actually negative , in this area .
at best , if nosprawltax had their way the tax collected on those properties would fall and everyone else 's would go up .
but to be fair , if we are going to eliminate all opportunity for those people other than the negative opportunity of growing crops -lrb- supposedly for our own tax benefit -rrb- then they need to be compensated ,
and our taxes will go up even more .
conservation is expensive ,
and what nosprawltax.org wants is no different from what they claim the developers want :
something at someone else 's expense .
there are hundreds of parcels indicated on the map ,
and they will one day be owned by thousands of taxpayers .
when built , the roads will be there for all to use , so how can we claim that the roads are being subsidized by taxpayers for the benefit of business interests ?
they are going to take their profits and move on , but the taxpayers will still be there , and still be paying or the roads they need .
you and i may or may not use the roads to go visit for a weekend poker game , or make a service call ,
but we can n't claim that the roads do n't benefit us :
we all participate in the economy .
building is something like 20 % of the economy .
to be sure , they are not paying enough .
none of us are , and to the extent we are not , all of us re being subsidized .
and where does the money for that subsidy come from ?
from the businesses we demonize and work for .
until we have a tax structure where each of us pays our share , we ca n't very well complain about the newcomers or subsidies for someone else .
schwartz 's claim that the new roads will do nothing for 99 % of the drivers in the region is a classic bad argument .
under that criteria , nothing will ever be built anywhere .
that is pretty much the situation we have backed ourselves into :
build ahead of time and you are promoting sprawl and someone else 's profits , build late and you are not solving the problem .
what anonymous 6:37 has n't figured out yet , is that special interests are actively working to make impossible what she has :
they would prefer that there be nothing there other than undisturbed and unmaintained land .
and she is making the same argument i have prevously made :
some commercial development makes it possible for people to work near where they live .
sprawl , if you choose to call it that , makes it possible for more people to own and maintain , and pay the taxes on , what remains of our rural landscape .
to the extent that occurs , people like her wo n't need to travel much farther to work and clog roads that are already overdeveloped .
so , let 's get off the schtick of blaming everybody else :
it is not productive .
our officials are stuck with the unenviable position of balancing opposing interests .
nobody likes sprawl
and everyone supports conservation ,
but it is going to be expensive to achieve goals we all say we want .
our officials are stuck with making their decision in the absence of any measurable criteria ,
and the special interests on both sides are so entrenched in their positions that someone will always be unhappy .
i frankly do n't think we know anywhere near enough to decide what the best use of transportation revenues is .
even emr says we know next to nothing about how we settle and live .
we should be working to give our oficials tools they can use to dispassionately make decisons that are best for all .
but using bad arguments against others that could equally well apply to ourselves does nothing to help the situation .
we should spend the energy and money studying what works and what does n't and understanding why and how to measure .
we can look at what works and what does n't and measure the characteristics of those places .
we should duplicate the ones that work and not duplicate the ones that do n't .
and we should expect to pay .
one thing we can be sure of , is that prosperity is a requirement of whatever works .
nosprawltax.org takes til hazel to task for his developments .
what they do n't point out is that georgetown sits on the site of a former hazel family farm .
they do n't point out that hazel owns substantial property that is under conservation easement .
that is something you can not afford to do without prosperity behind you .
while nosprawltax rails against hazel 's developments on the basis they are not wanted and they are bad for taxpayers , the fact reamins that they are all sold to taxpayers .
when you look at the ballston corridor , those high rises were essentially subdivided from property formerly owned as single family homes .
those homes were sold because the owners could no longer hold on to them at the prices being offered and taxed at .
the situation is no different fo people that previously owned the parcels on the nosrawltax.org map .
i have no doubt the same thing will happen to me eventually .
the same thing may be happening to tmt .
when the time comes , both of us will sell to the highest bidder ,
and i do n't expect nosprawltax.org to be on the bidders ' list .
more likely , someone like anonymous 6:37 will be .
right after she buys , she will probably join nosprawltax.org .
there might be some other alternative , but whatever it is is going to cost money .
i sure hope it does n't come out of my pocket .
ray - i 'm not endorsing anyone 's agenda by my reference to the web page
and i surely do n't begrudge anyone the ability to lobby for what they want .
i do , however , think that elected officials need to be willing to say `` no '' when they do n't think something makes good sense .
one of the most refreshing experiences is to have an elected official honestly tell you that he / she simply can not support your request because it 's too expensive or because he / she simply does not support the request .
what i and , hopefully , quite a few other virginians want to see is our elected officials walk their talk .
this problem flows from the top on down .
right , wrong or indifferent , tim kaine won office because he said `` we can not permit more development where the roads can not handle the traffic ''
and `` we can not pave our way out of this mess . ''
yet , once in office , he jumps to the other side .
reasonable people can argue that kaine 's position that would limit the ability to develop one 's land was stupid or plain wrong .
but we should all agree that his running away from the very position that put him in office is disgraceful .
my engineer friends tell me that one can prioritize transportation projects based on what expenditures would produce the most improvement in traffic flow , etc.
yet , that 's not how virginia funds transportation infrastructure .
we do it based on lobbying the ctb .
what the nst map does show is that the goal of the sales tax referendum was mainly to build or expand roads near landholdings .
that is not improving transportation , but a group of investors seeking a subsidy .
-lrb- i have a good friend who attended a meeting in richmond where a famous developer stood up and told the crowd that he built things and its was the taxpayers ' job to pay for the infrastructure to support whatever he built .
that 's the virginia way . -rrb-
these landowners could offer to build or expand the roads near their properties .
look at the roads that disney and others built in florida .
i do n't fault the landowners for trying .
i do fault those elected officials who fail to say `` no '' to projects that would not fix traffic problems . my criticism is not just for roads , but also for extending metro to dulles at a huge cost that will not improve
the table shows several roads with los f that , after spending billions on metro , are still los f .
fixing traffic problems ?
hardly .
likewise , if we are in a transportation mess , why are n't our elected officials -- especially the senate -- addressing vdot 's total lack of internal cost controls ?
walk the talk .
ok .
now we agree .
lobbying groups should be free to lobby .
but they had better bring an argument that is supportable as in `` prioritize transportation projects based on what expenditures would produce the most improvement in traffic flow '' and not as in `` its was the taxpayers ' job to pay for the infrastructure to support whatever he built '' , and not as in `` new roads will do nothing for 99 % of the drivers '' .
and officials should be free to say no when it does n't make any sense .
that goes for lobbyists on both sides of the fence .
now , if we can just find some agreement on what does make sense ....
i agree that metro to dulles wo n't do a thing for traffic congestion , but i 'm not so sure it does n't make some sense by some other measure .
but clearly , using tolls to pay for metro -lrb- instead of road improvements -rrb- while simultaneously claiming that cars and roads do n't pay their way is both nutso and egregiously unfair .
those that benefit should pay , but at the same time , we ca n't make egregious statements about who benefits , or who does n't .
at some level , everybody benefits , but the benefits probably decrease rapidly with distance .
whatever formula we come up with is going to be complex ,
but we ought to be able to come up with something that is a -rrb- measurable and b -rrb- makes enough sense so that all but the nut cases can see the sense in it .

the wall street journal editorial page this morning has praised `` a gang of conservative gop members in the general assembly '' for foiling gov. timothy m. kaine 's taxes - for - transportation plan .
`` this was a victory against long odds , because the renegade house members were lined up against the governor , powerful republicans in the state senate , elements of the business community and the state 's largely pro-tax media . ''
the journal cited the state 's revenue surplus as a major reason why voters never warmed to the tax - hike idea , and noted that it did n't help that kaine was trying to raise gasoline taxes amidst soaring retail prices at the pump .
i wonder how the journal would interpret news from the washington post today that del. david b. albo , r - springfield and a number of other gop delegates would like to raise an estimated $ 400 million a year from northern virginia to spend on local road and rail projects .
`` roads cost money , '' the post quotes albo as saying .
`` i 'd love to find a way to pay for the things we need by not raising taxes and using existing revenue ,
but i 'm a realist . ''
while most gop delegates were willing to hang together to oppose a statewide tax increase , there seems to be little appreciation of the root causes of transportation dysfunction in virginia .
oh , sure , you 've got yer bill howell talking about tolls and privatization ,
and you 've got yer tim hugo backing telework ,
and the house did pass some marginally useful legislation dealing with vdot and land use ,
but deep down inside , in their heart of hearts , most delegates share the assumption of their counterparts in the state senate that the cause of traffic congestion is insufficient transportation capacity .
the disagreement is over how much money the state can afford to raise to pay for improvements .
personally , i think it 's a bit too early for anyone to proclaim a `` victory . ''
yes , the house has temporarily beat back proposals for some $ 1 billion in tax increases .
but simply starving the current , broken transportation system of funds is n't going to solve anything .
the house , along with everyone else , needs to get on with the business of re-thinking transportation fundamentals .
otherwise , they 'll end up like dave albo , promoting tax increases through the back door .
the business of re-thinking transportation fundamentals then testing , validating , and implementing the results of all that thinking is going to take longer and cost more than what they have saved by starving the current system of funds .
it is going to take much more than a billion dollars in tax increases to achieve any alternative plan , and then the alternative may turn out to be like the inter-county connector :
that is , the same old plan only 50 years later .
in the meantime , we still suffer under the costs of the congestion tax , for which we get nothing in return ,
and the costs of any action , whether alternative or traditional continues to go up .
in the end we are going to be coming around to the back door like beggars ,
but the alms will be around $ 4 billion instead of one .
yeah , i 'd say it was too early to claim victory .
jim : thank you for recognizing the problem .
`` but simply starving the current , broken transportation system of funds is n't going to solve anything .
the house , along with everyone else , needs to get on with the business of re-thinking transportation fundamentals . ''
your `` but deep down inside , in their heart of hearts , most delegates share the assumption of their counterparts in the state senate that the cause of traffic congestion is insufficient transportation capacity . '' is challenged by the post report on the view of the leaders in the senate
they say the state 's less populated regions are also in desperate need of better roads to draw jobs and reverse economic decline .
until our leaders recognize that the role of transportation is limited to being economic enabler , and not an economic driver we will be locked in to the current funding stalemate .
spending taxpayer dollars on transportation to `` draw jobs and reverse economic decline '' is like pushing on a rope .
reducing the costs of the congestion tax is the only way to advance the virginia 's economy .
and yet 90 % of the state 's roads are uncongested 90 % of the time
and 45 % of all travel happens on and during the other 10 % .
how hard is this to figure out , really ?
traffic congestion is less during recessions , and some cities would willingly trade high unemployment rates for congestion .
traffic congestion becomes self - correcting when businesses choose to leave an area because it is too crowded and plagued by delays .
politicians want the growth that brings congestion , yet they also want to control or reduce that congestion .
they refuse to implement effective strategies to relieve congestion because the stringent solutions required might , like congestion itself , redirect growth to other areas .
this is not a new problem .
rome restricted deliveries to night time because the carts made the streets dangerous , but night deliveries interrupted sleep .
london had parking restrictions in the 1600's .
affordable public transportation was developed to ease the overcrowding and polllution that prevailed before .
zoning was developed in new york to encourage people to move out of the city center , subsidized by flat fares on the trolleys .
later , trolley tracks became jammed with trolleys and the system became overcrowded .
when roads began to take over from railroads , the problem soon became obvious :
`` none of us should delude ourselves , however , that the road problem of virginia ... will be solved at least for many years .
those who use the roads will demand wider , smoother and safer roads due to their increasing use and the consequent congestion on the highways . '' -
governor harry byrd , 1930 state of the commonwealth
whether you call smart growth , transit oriented design , new urbanism , pedestrian oriented communities or what have you , the end result of higher densities will be more congestion in more localized places .
we might be able to alleviate some of that by creating a transit system that is 20 times as dense as we have ,
but i doubt we have the economic stomach for that , either , particularly since that style of living is likely to attract only 15 % of the population .
planners and environmentalists are disingenuous when they urge us to fight congestion through smart growth .
politicians at heart , they really want more congested environments -lrb- for everyone else -rrb- but presumably want that congestion to be somehow managed and accommodated .
if it is not accommodated , people will start to move to the suburbs specifically to avoid congestion .
as george will put it , `` the purpose of ' smart ' ' coordinated ' growth is to prevent the masses , in their freedom , from producing democracy 's byproducts -- untidiness and even vulgarity .
and the bland notion of ' planning ' often is the rubric under which government operates when making its preferences and prophecies -- often meaning its arrogance and its mistakes -- mandatory . ''
so , it 's not all that hard to push a rope - you just need to freeze it first .
but anyone that thinks any of this is going to be solved , by whatever means , without lots and lots of money needs to go back to square one .
jim , i ask , what is victory ?
for the dems , either no transportation deal or a comprehensive one is victory , the former because it imporves the electoral landscape in '07 .
for the gop , something akin to what they were proposing may seem to be a victory to them , but more likely a victory for the dems because voters wo n't see any benefit by '07 .
but jim , is it a victory solely if taxes are n't raised ?
bob , no , i would n't define victory as simply not raising taxes -- although i definitely would like to defer raising taxes as long as prudently possible .
to me , victory would be winning the acknowledgement of a critical mass of the general assembly that the solution to traffic congestion is not just raising taxes / adding capacity .
a rational approach to transportation would entail -lrb- 1 -rrb- creating communities with a mix of housing / office / retail / amenities to reduce the number and length of automobile trips , -lrb- 2 -rrb- reforming counterproductive zoning codes , subdivision ordinances and comprehensive plans in order to create more transit - friendly and pedestrian - friendly communities , -lrb- 3 -rrb- creating funding sources for transportation that establishes a rational nexus between those who use / benefit from transportation facilities and those who pay for them , -lrb- 4 -rrb- promoting telework , -lrb- 5 -rrb- liberating mass transit from government monopolies and encouraging private sector innovation , -lrb- 6 -rrb- using a wide range of tools , from corridor management to intelligent transportation systems , to increase the capacity of existing thoroughfares , -lrb- 7 -rrb- stretching the value of road construction / maintenance dollars through outsourcing , and -lrb- 8 -rrb- prioritizing transportation projects on a congestion - mitigation return on investment basis .
virginia has started tinkering with a number of these , but has not systematically explored any of them .
until the general assembly gets serious about fundamental change , we can not declare victory -- no matter how high / low taxes and raised / cut .
bob - with all due respect , you 're blowing smoke .
most people in nova want an adequate public facilities ordinance and do n't believe that anything related to transportation is anything more than another way to foster more development .
they believed that in 2002 and still do today .
people voted for tim kaine because many of us truly believed his statement that `` enough was enough . ''
many of us saw his very modest proposal to postpone development where the roads could not handle today 's traffic as a small step towards apf .
-lrb- kaine made his `` promise '' with full knowledge of the power of the builders in virginia . -rrb-
yet , once confronted with the expected opposition , kaine did a 180 and joined the other side --
`` pay more , so we can develop more . ''
there are quite a few good democrats , independents and republicans who now believe that tim kaine has joined the dark side .
no one believes that anything before the general assembly will fix the transportation mess we have .
no one trusts any virginia elected official on land use issues , especially given kaine 's switch and gerry connolly 's wholesale giveaways to the developers .
-lrb- how about $ 43 million plus in fairfax county taxpayer subsidies to land development and zoning services since `` condo connolly '' took over the bos chair ? -rrb-
this is not to argue that the gop is sitting any better .
people in nova want an end to policies that support growth without regard to the impacts on current residents .
if i wanted to run for office in 07 , i 'd go door - to - door and say `` i 'm running because tim kaine lied to us about development
and i 'll fight for an adequate public facilities ordinance as my number one priority .
i 'll oppose any transfer of more money from nova taxpayers until we get apf . ''
i 'll bet you i 'd get more votes from democrats , independents and republicans than a candidate who says we need to continue the status quo , but with more funding for vdot .
-lrb- 1 -rrb- and -lrb- 2 -rrb- are part and parcel of the same thing .
it might reduce the number and length of some car trips ,
but it will result in more localized congestion , and maybe even more congestion overall .
reducing the number of trips is not ordinarily a rational approach to transportation , although it could be in some limited cases .
-lrb- 3 -rrb- i have no problem with , except that even non-users benefit from roads , so it ca n't be totally user driven .
-lrb- 4 -rrb- i agree with and support , however we may have already sucked much of the juice out of that orange
and it conflicts with -lrb- 1 -rrb- .
if you accomplish -lrb- 5 -rrb- you will effectively eliminate much of mass transit , unless you have privately operated but subsidized mass transit .
this is a recipe for pork , payola , and patronage .
-lrb- 6 -rrb- increasing the capacity of existing thoroughfares is a waste since 90 % of our roads are underused 90 % of the time .
it is also an admission that -lrb- 1 -rrb- is insufficient .
-lrb- 7 -rrb- and -lrb- 8 -rrb- i have no problem with .
but i really have a problem with -lrb- 2 -rrb- .
it is ok so far as it goes ,
but the likely market for the market created by such zoning might only be 15 % of the population .
what it leaves out is what happens to everybody else , who happens not to be in an area designated for transit friendly development .
are you also willing to also reform counterproductive zoning codes that requires people to stay in the business of farming , for example ?
if more density is good for some areas , why not all ?
i know your answer will be that those people should be allowed to live where they please as long as they pay their full locational costs .
but we can already see that those costs are subject to maipulation :
people whose costs include supporting the dulles toll road are also supporting the transit that will make it possible for future residents to live in transit friendly neighborhoods .
whatever happened to them paying their full locational costs ?
transit is going to require massive and widespread subsidies to even partially work .
here , again , some allowance needs to be made for the idea that transit provides some limited benefit to non-users .
so , those people who are left out will be expected to pay for the transit that helps make those included in development areas possible .
at the same time they will likely be excluded from increasing density even when it is to their benefit -lrb- they may live next to those 90 % of roads that are underutilized -rrb- .
this will be done partially in order to artificially create the demand required to fill the designated areas , and the cover story will be that it is for the environment , to save prime farmland , etc.
this amounts to disingenuously making certain preferences and prophesies mandatory ,
and i do n't think it will fly .
when virginia does systematically explore these ideas they may very well come to the conclusion that fundamental change is a really lousy idea , and that , bad as it is , business as usual is the best option after all .
the main reson they are likely to reach that conclusion is that the costs for all this theoretical thinking and experimental development is going to be far higher than the money we `` saved '' on transportation by not providing it .
i see what tmt says as the other side of the same coin i described above .
if we get apf's they will be disproportionately used against those who are `` left out '' of development plans , and consequently used to ram still more development down tmt 's throat .
after all , they will say , that is where the most facilities are ;
even if they are inadequate , they are more adequate than places that have none .
will rogers once joked that if you wanted to cure traffic congestion , just make people pay cash for their cars up front .
the apf idea is the same kind of joke .
none of the development we have was built when the facilities were adequate , and much of it was built specifically to get away from places that had inadequate facilities and were over built .
we are not going to pay for apf's up front , so it is a recipe for creating either no development or only hoplessly expensive development
-lrb- see morgan 's riflemen -rrb- .
apf's are a good idea only if you are willing to provide a dedicated and adequate funding stream for them , same as for metro .
and that means you need a lot more money .
and it is no good to claim that it has to be done without impacting current residents .
it is still going to come out of your pocket in the end .
just as roads benefit those who do n't drive and transit benefits those that do n't ride , development benefits those that do n't build .
this last creates a real problem and hardship because existing residents have no way to capitalize on their fortune unless they move .
but if the apf's are disproportionately applied , then there wo n't be any place to move to .
in that case the benefits and disbenefits of apf's cancel each other out ,
and there is no reason to implement what is a lousy idea to begin with .
i do n't have online access to the wsj , but did it really refer to the `` general assembling '' and did it also fault kaine for `` trying to raise gasoline taxes ? ''
if so , does the wsj have a fact checker on staff ?
once we 're done with this doomed debate , we can move on to contemplate the doubled energy prices we can all expect when we get to enjoy the full benefits of a deregulated electricity market in a couple years .
hmmm --
double the cost of juice and hopelessly clogged roads .
will the last ones out `` free market '' virginia please turn out the lights on your way to north carolina ?
not grover , thanks for catching my typo .
i have corrected it .
and that 's a good point about kaine 's `` gasoline tax . ''
there has been so much back and forth that i ca n't remember every permutation of every tax plan .
but was not the point of both the kaine and the senate tax plans to not tax gasoline at the pump -- indeed to tax anything but gasoline at the pump ?
in that case , the wsj got its information very wrong .
yesterday as i was cruising along at below traffic speed but still 65 in 55 a tow truck passed me like i was sitting still .
he was running at least 75 and maybe more .
he was towing a school bus .
that kind of behavior makes you think there might be some value in albo 's plan to increase fines for really bad drivers , especially since almost a third of traffic cogestion is caused by incidents .
i have long held that fines for professional drivers should be tripled -
these guys should know better .
jim , i agree with most of your proposals , or at least the goals you hope to achieve with them .
but i am suspicious of the outsourcing and private partnerships .
i 'd rather reform public entities because private entities require a level of cost public ones should n't -- profit .
i agree with ray that even non-users of transportation facilities benefit from them , but i do favor higher gas taxes and other directly related user fees .
and with congestion the way it is , building roads to nowhere in the hopes of fostering economic development may not be feasible .
ray , i 'm surprised you think we ca n't do more teleworking .
seems we have many opportunities to expand it .
but overall , demanding such reforms before expanding capacity simply wo n't work in the real world .
first , we 'll need to reform american capitalism itself , eliminating the public supported breaks we give to business , whether they be home developers , road builders , or farmers , as well as homeowners , i.e. , interest rate deductions .
bottom line is we need more capacity and land use reform .
my interest is the politics of it .
which brings me back to the same question , asked in that context :
how do you judge when the reforms you want are sufficient to invest more in increasing capacity ?
jim , you may have a clear vision in your head about what that threshold is ,
but i sense from the smartgrowth folks and anti-taxers who make many of the same arguements you do that any amount of reform will never be enough .
i think emr convinced me that those that really can telework already do so .
there are a lot of people for whom it does not apply , retail , mechanics , etc.
there is more we can do on telework , but ed suggests the well is not as deep as we would like to believe .
then again , it runs counter or provides impetus that is counter to his other ideas .
i was formerly more optimistic ,
but in this case i found his argument persuasive .
i 'm open to more hard data , and i believe the biggest hindrance is organizational , not technical .
i favor higher gas taxes and user fees , too , but not exclusively because we all have a stake in roads .
i would make the same argument for transit :
it is ok for the general public or auto drivers -lrb- which is much the same thing -rrb- to provide some support for transit because there is some -lrb- small -rrb- benefit to everyone for those that are able and willing to use metro etc.
on the other hand , once we understand how small that benefit really is we might decide it 's just not worth it ,
and we should let the thing be privatized where it works and disappear where it does n't .
i 'm with you .
we can not take hard lines on every issue and make progress in any direction .
unfortunately , for some , strategic stalemate is just as good as any other means of conservation , never mind whatever other harm it does .

not only is virginia heading for a fiscal crisis , but it may be heading for a constitutional crisis as well .
the senate and house of delegates managed to get budget talks back on track last week ,
but negotiations derailed faster than an amtrak train in a snow storm .
judging by the exchange of letters released to the public , relations between the senate and house budget conferees are as acrimonious as they 've ever been .
there are 24 days left to patch together a budget before the fiscal year ends .
then the state enters a constitutional crisis .
gov. timothy m. kaine says he has the authority to keep basic state services running without a budget .
but attorney general robert f. mcdonnell says he does not .
-lrb- read the washington post coverage . -rrb-
meanwhile , senior state lawmakers are due to visit bond rating agencies in new york .
virginia may be the best managed state in the country when the politicians are actually speaking to one another , but it 's not looking terribly well managed right now .
only two years ago , on the heels of the last recession , virginia 's political class was consternated that the state 's aaa bond rating might be cut .
would n't it be ironic if , despite the 2004 tax increase and a $ 1.5 billion surplus , the rating agencies cut virginia 's bond rating anyway this year ?
it would appear given the deadlocks and disputes that have afflicted our general assembly since 2001 , the vaunted republican majority is just not now nor has it ever been ready for prime time governing .
anon : ' ever ' is a bit of hyperbole .
the rinos are unfit to govern .
that is for sure .
the phony bond crisis of 04 was that virginia could ' only ' borrow $ 800 m if the commonwealth wanted to do so . why mr. atticus bowden , if `` ever '' were hyperbole perhaps you could tell me when they did manage to govern -- all by themselves , of course ?
the last time they did have a chance was in the 19th century .
as i recall the republican and readjuster movement failed then , too .
the beauty of democracy is that people get the government they deserve .
we in virginia drank the kool - aid and elected a bunch of culture warrior idealogues instead of good , pragmatic stewards .
we get what we deserve .
i believe that it would be better to imperil our bond rating than to pass a budget that continues the taxation practices of the past two general assemblies .
i patently reject the idea that the only way out of this morass is to pass a budget that has a net tax increase .
we have to get off this tax and spend merry - go - round .
it 's time we republicans return to our roots of fiscal conservancy .
anon : the gop majority did fine with the car tax relief from the 2000 session until the 2002 session when they passed the 2002 tax scam .
also , i was being a bit hopeful that ' ever ' means in the future too .
i agree , that republicans have n't covered themselves in glory in the ga in the few years our party has been in the majority .
getting rid of the old dem retreads like his lordship sir john chichester , tommy norment , etc. will improve the governance .
yeah .
you 're right in line with vance wilkins .
getting rid of the old dem retreads like his lordship sir john chichester , tommy norment , etc. will improve the governance .
from your lips to god 's ears , mr. brown !
old dem retreads i am aware of include ronald reagan , mills godwin , lacey putney ....
btw down at the funny farm today not only did they make no progress on the new budget , it seems that the agreement on the `` caboose bill '' for the current fiscal year is unraveling .
the governor made a mistake offering amendments .
it just gave them a new chance to screw it all up again .
update : reason prevailed on the `` caboose bill '' and the house backed off a last minute amendment that the senate would n't go along with , so at least that budget is done .
otherwise that bill would have ended up back in the conference committee again .
to see this going on in virginia now is truly an embarrassment .
the senate gave in on its main point weeks ago and if we reach july 1 with no budget , it is on the house 's head .
ronald reagan was a convert , a true believer , who actually believed the same stuff
and the dems left him .
virginia has dem retreads who know the gop stands for getting elected , but do n't know what the acronym means .
i 'm just trying to fathom the mess we 're going to have if this is n't settled by 7 / 1 .
if we really ca n't pay anyone out of emergency funds , i 'm trying to get my head around what that means -
if i understand it correctly :
no state police on duty
no guards at the state prisons
-lrb- and what are we going to do with the inmates ? -rrb-
no one to handle the patients at the state mental hospitals
no one to handle the patients at the state regular hospitals - mcv , uva , etc.
what happens to the patients ?
no one working at the state colleges for summer school or research or sending out transcripts and getting ready for the next year -
and no classes at the community colleges
all the state parks closed -
i do n't thnk you can have them open w/o any staff -lrb- trash , safety , etc -rrb-
no unemployment for the furloughed state workers , b/c is n't that handled by state workers ?
most of the folks that give restaurant and well and septic permits furloughed state courts closed
no one to fix the roads or finish temporary repairs or new construction
a huge mess with figuring out pay and benefits for state workers , who are not going to be happy about this
liquor stores all closed medical examiners and no state forensic lab specialists all gone home no one at consolidated labs to do rabies checks
no public health people to do the kids ' back to school shots , or epidemiology for homeland security , or the school physicals for sports
no one at the department of vital statistics -
how will we get birth or death certificates ?
state lottery would be closed
the science museum in richmond would be closed
the dmv would be closed
the virginia museum of fine arts would be closed
vrs retirement checks presumably wo n't go out and probably a hundred things i have n't thought of .
i 've seen folks say it wo n't be any big deal .
personally , it sounds like a huge honking mess to me .
after seeing the list of what would not be open and / or on duty ... which i 'm also quite sure is not complete ... i 'll go out on a limb .... and predict ... that this will not happen
and what is really going on is the ga equivalent of two cars speeding towards each other until someone blinks .
i 'll also predict ... that the classic fall - back position for virginia is the same one used by the feds -
continue the budget using last budget allocations ... continuing resolution and all that stuff .
on the actual issue of how much tax is enough - i find myself influenced by both sides ' arguments to a certain extent but i guess what i can not understand is that all things being equal .. does n't population growth result in more tax revenues that would be allocated presumedly as they were before - in other words priorities remain the same in terms of allocations ?
if everyone - those already here plus our population growth is to pay higher taxes - should there be an expectation on the part of taxpayers to receive more services ... and of course .... what about those that are opposed to the government providing services that private industry could do - for less .
this certainly goes for transportation where we talk about a `` crisis '' that can only be solved by higher taxes and more government spending .
here 's an interesting article from pilot online :
http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=105522&ran=48577
`` the pocahontas parkway , a state - owned toll road that opened four years ago on richmond 's outskirts , has been a financial flop .
with traffic below projections , the nonprofit corporation that operates the road has struggled to avoid defaulting on its bonds .
but salvation has come from an unlikely suitor - an australian company called transurban that has agreed to pay the virginia department of transportation $ 522 million in exchange for a 99 - year lease of the road .
that an australian company has agreed to spend $ 522 million on pocahontas parkway , a road that last year collected just $ 10.3 million in tolls .
in exchange for the right to keep all parkway toll revenue , transurban agreed to build a 1.6 - mile , four - lane road to the richmond international airport , pending federal approval .
it also will pay off the parkway 's debt and upgrade its electronic tolling equipment in anticipation of a rate increase expected in 2008 . ''
so ... i 'd ask ... why not replicate this approach to some of our more urgent transportation problems and get vdot and the state of virginia out of the business of collecting taxes ... and apparently not knowing how to build even toll roads that will be cost - effective ?
is this why the ga guys are playing `` chicken '' with the budget ?
at 10:06 pm , anonymous said ..
wow ...
talk about hyperbole !
none of what you wrote will happen .
it may not happen -
but , if we shut down the virginia state government , that is what will happen .
i went to dhrm -lrb- the state human resources dept -rrb- and looked at the open jobs , to see what the state does .
state employees , who will be off duty if the budget is not passed and kaine does not move ahead , would include :
the state police
the staff and faculty of state universities and community colleges the public health staff of the state and localities of virginia -lrb- most are state employees even if they are working in your local county - ask if you do n't believe -rrb-
these are the folks that inspect your restaurants , give your kids their back to school shots , give the inspections for well and septic installation , and investigate many dog bites .
the folks at the state department of vital statistics -lrb- birth and death certificates -rrb-
the staff and guards at the state prisons
the nurses , doctors , and other staff at the state teaching hospitals , such as mcv and uva
the nurses , doctors , and staff at the state mental facilities
the staff at our state parks
the folks who distribute unemployment , disability , and state retirement checks
the judges and employees of our state courts
the folks at vdot
all the folks at the abc stores
all the folks at the virginia lottery
the state and regional medical examiners and the state forensic lab specialists
the staff at the state museums
the folks at the dmv
and if you ca n't pay the state workers , you can not have contractors working either , because that is incurring debt whether you pay them immediately or not .
go look at dhrm and the state courts system -lrb- separate hr dept -rrb- and see what the state folks do , and who all you 're talking about furloughing .
then try to tell me that shutting down the state government is n't going to be noticed by the average citizen .
they 'll notice .
and the ones that get really hurt by this , for whatever reason -lrb- see above -rrb- are going to be pretty ticked off .
not only will it tick off a huge number of state employees and their families , but also the folks on state retirement -lrb- which i believe also includes many folks retired from localities under vrs -rrb- , an awful lot of just regular citizens , and an awful lot of businesses .
this is n't hyperbole .
look at what the state government actually does .
shutting the state government down is not an idea that 's going to help get votes in november .
unless you mean helping get votes for your opponent .

a toll road in u.s. 460 's future private industry is showing interest in financing and building a new u.s. 460 , peter bacque with the richmond times - dispatch is reporting .
tidewater skanska , a subsidiary of swedish construction giant skanska ab , has committed to making a proposal to improve the 55 - mile highway between u.s. 58 in suffolk and interstate 295 near petersburg .
the virginia department of transportation , which is orchestrating the project , is hoping for at least two competing proposals .
with no public money available , improvements would have to be financed through tolls .
the problem is that the market seems unlikely to support the $ 9.70 per vehicle it would cost to travel the full length of the road .
needless to say , residents of hamlets like zuni and wakefield who use 460 as a local thoroughfare will be none too happy with paying tolls every time they pull onto the road .
to offset sky - high tolls , bacque says , vdot is encouraging innovative financing schemes such as supporting `` economic development opportunities . ''
bacque did not enumerate those opportunities in his article ,
but they could well be tied to major port expansions slated for hampton roads .
moffat & nichol , an engineering consulting firm , prepared a study for the virginia port authority last year advocating development of a major intermodal park off u.s. 460 as a way to handle an anticipated 900,000 additional containers annually expected to move through the ports .
those containers would require between 20 million and 60 million square feet of additional distribution space , employ 9,000 people directly and generate $ 788 million in wages from direct and indirect jobs .
i 'm normally a big fan of toll - driven projects on the principle that users should pay for transportation improvements .
and i 'm all in favor of a project that would enable the expansion of virginia 's ports and improve employment prospects for the rural southside counties along u.s. 460 .
but i 'm also wary of the potential for an upgraded u.s. 460 to act as a wick for the expansion of more hop - scotch , disconnected , low - density development out of hampton roads -- a pattern of development that would negate many of the benefits of the economic development .
if the kaine administration wants to align transportation and land use planning , a good place to start would be with projects , like this one , that emanate from the administration itself .
any evaluation of the competing proposals needs to consider the impact not just on traffic counts and toll financing but local human settlement patterns .
the `` good '' part about private investor toll roads is that real money is riding on the `` demand '' calculation and when real money is involved , less likely that the predicted demand data will be `` cooked '' to justify the road .
the `` bad '' part is that vdot is still involved and i 'm sure will find new ways to screw things up . the `` ugly '' needs some explanation
and i 'll use the history channel 's show on the first national railroad .
pointed out in that program that the `` incentives '' for attracting private investment to build the rail was `` free land '' to those who built the rail .
so take a private investor .. any private investor who `` proposes '' to build a major road - like 460 - and folks will fall all over themselves about their good fortune ...
but consider ... if those same investors - at the same time they were building the road - were also buying up land to develop - that would be more easily developable because of the new road ?
now .. the investors .. i 'm quite sure would be saying the same words that we hear now days ...
that they are only responding to a demand .. they did not create it . :--rrb-
other views ?
so your point is that if private money is developing the roads and private money is developing the land then government loses control over the plan .
furthermore the infrastructure is privately owned so they can gouge all they want .
sounds like a plan .
all we need is enough speculators to make it work .
ray , your explanation sounds good to me .
developing us 460 and linking it to a rail and road crossing from the port of norfolk is the way to take traffic off i on the peninsula . one would hope that some kind of safeguards have been put into the va public - private law to deal with this potential .
overall , i am a supporter of private investor toll roads - provided they utilize ort - open road -lrb- electronic -rrb- tolling so that only those who refuse to obtain transponders have to stop at toll plazas .
the comment on rail is interesting because some of the opponents of expanding i would like to see parallel rail facilities so that the scope and scale of improving of i might be more modest .
so .. connecting the dots .. rail on i that connects to rail on i ... :--rrb-
here 's some further thoughts for whatever they might be worth .. or not .
let 's start with the premise that increased population and new jobs means more people who need a place to live .
let 's further specify that many folks who accept the population - growth realities are still , none - the - less not happy with the settlement patterns that result from free - market responses to the housing demand .
let 's finally specify that one of the major agnsts with regard to folks ' views with respect to settlement patterns - is the impacts on the transportation network - in the form of increased traffic and congestion on roads not designed to handle such increased volumes and no money available to upgrade them anytime soon .
so ... enter a private investor who agrees to build not only a toll road , but develop land to serve the housing demand - and ... what he -lrb- she -rrb- develops is .. in fact , new urban , compact developments .
so , in doing so - the developer solves three problems :
1 . - provides needed new housing
2 . - provides efficient compact development that includes bike and ped and mixed - use format .
3 . - provides the road capacity to serve the new developments -lrb- via a new toll road -rrb- .
... why would such a thing be a bad thing ?
larry gross : you already have rail - coal and amtrak along old us 60 / i 64 on the peninsula .
the idea is rail on the southside to take the port of norfolk containers . i always thought high speed on the peninsula connecting to richmond and dc was the ticket ,
but i was told by folks who know better than me that the cost of upgrading or adding to the existing tracks -lrb- bringing coal to the nn port -rrb- and running pokey old amtrak would take a lot of lot of lot money .
there may not be the case for companies to do it .
hmm ...
but where are those port of norflolk containers headed to ?
re : new rail / private investors
i 've always wondered why private rail can not compete with public roads for the transportation of goods .
i 've heard lots of explanations .. but du n no that i 've ever seen a clear analysis .
for that matter .. i 've never seen a comparison betwen what the costs are for one mile of rail right - of - way vs one mile of 18 - wheeler - capable highway right - of - way .. much less the comparative operating costs between a load of goods transported by rail vs road .
but my point is ... rails wo n't be used instead of roads unless / until they are superior in terms of cost and effectiveness -lrb- movement of goods from point a to point b -rrb-
i can see where .. at some point goods must travel by truck because rail simply can not go everywhere that our road network does
but when we still transfer goods across the country - by truck .. verses rail .. the obvious question is why ?
and my ignorance ... leaves me with `` well , presumedly , the company that needed the goods shipped would not have chosen the more expensive method '' .
... and if it is cheaper to move goods across the company by truck .. then why would we expect moving goods across virginia to be any cheaper ?
.... all things being equal ... which i doubt seriously is the case .
lost in the hyperbole coming from hampton roads about `` tolls '' being the only way to save our so - called `` transportation crisis '' is any factual information about `` tolls '' .
toll roads are 4 times more costly to run , than by using the gas tax .
and in fact in virginia it will cost even more as there is no big bureaucracy in place to administer it .
got to staff all those toll booths .
health insurance , retirement funds , sick leave , uniforms , and a huge hr department to make sure all those federal regulations are followed it but the opening salvo .
let 's not forget the `` maintenance '' costs .
toll booths , collection machines -lrb- electronic devices for you `` ez pass '' sheep are 10 times more costly to maintain -rrb-
and then there is the risk .
the risk being experienced by the dulles toll road folks who have been losing more money than they knew they could lose .
people will avoid your road if it 's toll !
the people who keep harping about `` tolls '' typically have no knowlege of how expensive it is to both run it and maintain it .
the sensible , logical way to fund roads is with a bureaucracy that is already established .
gas tax .
however , this all ignores the need for a complete housecleaning at vdot .
the root cause of why people do n't want to give more money to the state for roads .
one glaring example .
the bogus , made up `` on time - on budget '' figures that vdot has been parading about .
were you aware that vdot does not include projects that are n't `` on time '' or `` over budget '' in that figure ?
the i / mercury blvd project that is 77 % over budget and almost 3 - years behind schedule -lrb- by vdot 's own account -rrb- is not included in the `` on time - on budget '' figure .
fix vdot first , then come back and talk about how you are going to fund our so called `` transportation crisis '' .
the only crisis in transportation we have in virginia is a loss of trust and confidence in both vdot and the legislature .
i 'm with pat .
tolls are a lousy idea .
they are a cheap shot way for the legislators to push their fialurs off on the faceless foreign businesses , and they are supported by people who think the tolls wo n't affect them .
if this catches on , we will live to regret the day .
we have tried private tolls before , and they did n't work .
as for trains , forget it unless your goods are travelling 600 miles or so , and happen to be gong in the same direction as the tracks .
the reasosn has less to do with the subsidies enjoyed by highways and truckers than it has to do with speed , reliability , and convenience .

if you 're arlington county , you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in crystal city that will be emptied by the federal base realignment and closure commission .
in place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the pentagon , members of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shops , restaurants and offices .
writes wapo reporter annie gowen :
-lsb- board of supervisors chairman chris -rsb- zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' crystal city as an attractive destination .
though close to reagan national airport and dense with hotels , the area has long been seen as a gloomy 1960s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages .
but parts of crystal city have lately seen a rebirth , thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape ....
charles e. smith commercial realty , which owns 7.4 million of the 11 million square feet of office space in the neighborhood , has spent $ 40 million on improvements to enliven the streets and attract new businesses .
it turned crystal drive into a two - way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as jaleo and mccormick & schmick 's .
reading between the lines of gowen 's story , however , there seems to be one big missing piece :
housing .
creating a livelier commercial district is a worthy goal .
but creating a balanced community with a mix of housing , offices , shopping and other amenities -- allowing people to live close to where they work and play -- is an even more worthy goal .
as ed risse has pointed out , the relocation of 17,000 jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in northern virginia .
the problem , i surmise -- it 's not discussed in the story -- is that arlington is concerned about protecting its tax base , which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices , not housing .
it 's hard to fault arlington for pursuing its short - term self interest .
but everyone needs to recognize that arlington 's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying counties .
and employees working in the buffed up crystal city will wind up commuting long distances and clogging northern virginia thoroughfares .
and the cry for new transportation revenues will grow ever more deafening .
right on .
did n't i read somewhere that some of those office buildings were considered worn out and that they would be demolished and replaced rather than refurbished ?
would that be an opportunity for more mixed use ?
is it an example of `` existing infrastructure '' that is worn out and outlived its usefuleness ?
this post has been removed by the author .
jim , minor point -
unlike most other virginia counties , arlington county does not have a board of supervisors .
it does have a county board .
members of the arlington county board are addressed not as supervisors , but as board members .
if arlington has sufficient public infrastructure to support housing at crystal city , adding housing to that area would be an excellent idea .
the question that the arlington community needs to answer is : whether the supporting infrastructure is sufficient ?
if not , what is the incentive for arlingtonians to dig deeper in their pockets to pay for public infrastructure so that the housing does not get constructed in outlying counties ?
the funds run one way from arlington , just as they do from fairfax -- down to richmond and then around the state .
moreover , while i 'm sure that many people would enjoy the urban life of a newly revitalized crystal city , many others would not .
many people simply want to live in single family , detached homes that will not be available in crystal city .
further , any housing built in that area will likey be quite costly given the price of land and the costs to construct high - rise buildings .
ray hyde has persuaded me that we need to provide incentives for good quality , higher paying jobs to locate in outlying areas .
there probably are n't enough tax dollars -- even in the mind of john chichester -- to fix nova 's transportation and other infrastructure problems that are , in large part , based on the high concentration of good - paying jobs here , along with a lack of both affordable housing .
unless builders are going to supply affordable housing at a loss -- which , to me , seems absurd , there wo n't be affordable housing here without even more tax subsidies .
-lrb- of course , every tax dollar spent on subsidizing housing is n't available for other purposes . -rrb-
that suggests sprawl will continue , as will the demand for more and more roads and other infrastructure .
virginia needs balanced job growth .
in theory , the loss of these jobs presents an opportunity to do something different in terms of settlement patterns .
perhaps to replace commercial businesses with housing and / or more balanced mixed - use .
lots of questions here but i do agree .. just the potential concept is provocative ...
but , what would be the benefit to arlington to do this ?
more specifically - what would be the benefit to those who already live and pay taxes in arlington ?
what would arlington have to provide in the way of additional infrastructure ?
-lrb- i 'm not sure that i would agree that more infrastructure would be needed for residential vs commercial but let 's explore it .
it would seem to be that if you took an office building in crystal and converted it to apartments .. you 'd not have any more people -lrb- perhaps less -rrb- so you would n't need any more water / sewer capacity ... and ditto for parking places ... at least it would seem so -rrb- .
ditto with commuting ...
instead of a hoard of folks `` in commuting '' from outer jurisdictions to arlington every morning , would n't you have instead - more `` out '' commuting .
finally , the folks who actually own the land - would they agree to a change in the zoning from office commercial to apartment residential ?
what would be the economics of this with respect to those who hold those properties as investments ?
it would seem - that arlington and the other area jurisdictions have already had such a choice for years - and that they chose commercial development over residential - in effect - letting more remote jurisdictions figure out how to provide residential for folks who wanted to work in nova and commute to the outer suburbs to live .
to a certain extent - one could say that no va jurisdictions have a responsibility to provide housing for those that work in the same area and not force workers to commute to outer jursidictions for housing in the first place .
in the end - every worker who , for whatever reason , ends up commuting ... that is one more person using the transportation network more intensively than those that live locally with shorter commutes .
so .. here 's a concluding thought .
what kind of an exercise would it be for each nova jurisdiction to total up the number of jobs in its boundaries verses the amount of housing within its boundaries .
would we see a big disparity ?
i know where i live in the outer suburbs that there is a big disparity in the opposite sense .
we have far , far more people in homes than we have jobs for them .
in other words a huge percent of our population are , in fact , nova commuters .
with respect to the jobs / housing question - i wonder what the totals would be for the entire nova area - all jursidictions with respect to jobs verses housing .
from an equity perspective - should jurisdictions provide as much housing as they have jobs ?
the mechanism for doing this would be zoning -
a certain percentage of areas would be reserved only for residential development or areas designated for mixed use development would have a hard percentage cap on how much residential had to be part of the mixed - used proposal .
or to turn this completely around - would folks support the right of any jurisdiction to zone entirely that jurisdiction for commercial / industrial only and let outlying jurisdictions provide residential ?
in some respects , is n't that essentially what no va jursidictions are doing - favoring non-residential development and letting other jursidictions handle the residential ?
turning this on its head - what is the incentive for a worker in crystal city to buy there ?
most jobs now do n't last for decades - no one expects a career at a company any more .
i would n't buy a house for one specific job - but if i bought at crystal city , i 'd be locked in to that area .
what happens if my next job is in silver spring , or leesburg , or quantico ?
am i supposed to buy and sell my house each time i change jobs ?
i 've been through six -lrb- high tech -rrb- jobs in the past 14 years - all while living at the same house , all good jobs and good career moves .
if i changed houses like the tech field requires you to change jobs , i 'd spend my entire life packing and unpacking .
living where you work is one of those `` nice idea , not real practical '' kind of things .
anonymous , you raise a legitimate point . people change jobs a lot ,
and no one can afford to move to a new house every time they get a new job .
that 's why people pay a premium to live in a central location --
it gives them proximity to a wider range of employment locations .
larry , this is my personal conviction :
if local governments were not given the power to restrict housing development through zoning , a free market would provide a much better balance of housing / jobs / retail / amenities than what we have now .
the answer is less regulation , not more .
jim : i believe in free markets as well , but i also hold that free markets are equally as free of economic subsidies as well as over - burdensome regulation .
what is the argument that letting people develop their property as desired without regard to the impact on existing residents and businesses is a free market ?
none of us would likely support the abolishment of all zoning as is basically the case in houston .
would we find it acceptable to allow the construction of a foundary in the middle of a residential neighborhood ?
what about building a 30 - story building in the flight path of dulles airport ?
few of us would likely support that .
we have a serious problem with public infrastructure in areas of virginia .
few dispute that .
what we argue over is who is responsible to fund the necessary infrastructure ; to what amount ; and should people be permitted to build in the absence of adequate public facilities .
reasonable people can answer these questions differently .
but , at some point , there is a question of basic equity that must be answered :
how much `` cost '' should society be able to impose on an existing resident / business so that someone else can use his or her property as they desire ?
since we would n't permit the foundary to built in the residential neighborhood , we all effectively agree that there are limits to how much cost we are willing to impose on existing residents .
stated alternatively , one does not have an absolute right to use his / her property as desired .
one question we might ask is : who is the cost - causer ?
the answer is always going to be `` the newcomer . ''
one might also ask : at what point does it become unfair to load all of the costs on the newcomer ?
few would likely argue that , because of the high forward - looking costs for constructing infrastructure , we should not permit any building in virginia without the upfront payment of the total costs for constructing infrastructure .
that would be unfair .
but , at the very same time , is n't equally unfair to load all of the infrastructure costs on taxpayers -- especially given virginia 's tax structure that takes much from nova and gives little back ? one might be able to make a good argument that we could save transportation costs by building densely in nova .
but what about the other infrastructure costs that are then imposed on residents of nova ?
what 's in it for us ?
re dense residential - see the article in today 's -lrb- 6 / 18 -rrb- wapo .
it offers some interesting insights and observations , including the following : `` gerald l. gordon , president of fairfax 's economic development authority , said jobs will keep moving toward the fringes ,
because employers ' first priority is being near a qualified workforce , and residents continue to seek affordable , spacious homes and good schools in more distant communities . ''
more evidence that ray hyde 's `` we need more places '' theory has legs .
people who want to live in new york city tend to move there .
why are we talking about spending billions of scarce tax dollars extending metrorail when it is n't going to fix the transportation problems ?
btw , check out the other story in the post today about fairfax county supervisor gerald hyland 's involvement with a developer 's attempt to obtain huge conservation tax credits .
what else goes on between segments of the business community and the supervisors ?
re : wapo article .
yes , agree it was excellent in describing the issues . but i 'm perplexed ... as usual ...
`` because employers ' first priority is being near a qualified workforce , and residents continue to seek affordable , spacious homes and good schools in more distant communities . ''
i found this rather odd in that the concept of `` near '' is apparently perceived differently depending on whether you were an employer or an employee .
employers want to be `` near '' a qualified workforce but employees -lrb- note they use the word residents -rrb- continue to seek ... homes in more distant communities .
unless i 'm not reading it properly ... it sounds like the employers ' concept of `` near '' is a very different concept than the employee 's concept of a `` near '' place to live .
would n't one presume that the two concepts be the same ... that the employee would want to be near where a qualified workforce lives ... and vice versa ?
also ... discussed in blog was the idea that folks do n't want to move everytime they change jobs which is an excellent point but how does that explain folks who move to the outer burbs ... and then change jobs that requires even a longer commute ?
are n't people who move to the outer burbs ... for housing .. locking themselves in to a less flexible situation the same way that someone would in trying to live next door to where they work because in both cases .. if they change jobs - they 've probably bought themselves a longer commute .
is n't it curious the employers want to be near a qualified work force ?
would n't that result in less travel rather than more ?
the other comment of interest was that most residents of mixed use communities do n't find employment there .
to the extent that some mixed use residents do find local employment that suits their skills , that is a good thing , and it will marginally reduce travel .
but we should not count on it as a panacea , and it does not conflict with the idea that we need more places .
`` mixed use '' and `` more places '' are compatible ideas .
the article should put to rest the argument that ed risse and i have had about job growth .
his previous statement was that while the percet job growth in pw was high the absolute number was small .
today we see that the absolute numbers are also higher .
if we choose to have a successful transportation plan then we should design the plan to meet the needs which will occur as a result of what is happening , rather than to meet the needs of what we wish would happen .
otherwise you have to design not only a transportation plan but a way to change everyone 's decisions in such a way as to make it work .
today 's article shows how difficult that is , so why choose a plan that is bound to fail ?
metro will not ease congestion and it has n't done so for the last thirty years .
what it does do is allow more people to travel to some places than can be acommodated by highways .
it does that by offering a lower level of service and less comfort -lrb- standing room only -rrb- .
it might be that there is still sufficient reason to spend billions of scarce dollars on metro , but easing traffic congestion is n't one of them .
we should evaluate the expenditure for what it does do and who benefits and assign the costs accordingly , if the expenditure is still reasonable .
clearly , that does not include billing the tollroad users for metro construction .
making route 7 sixteen lanes is probably just as bad an idea as metro .
that is just another plan to take everyone to the same place , which we know will fail .
the difference is that those who use that route will have individually controlled climate , music , and seats .
and they can eat or smoke if they choose .
aside from gerald gordon 's comments , you have jay fissette saying that we have not fully made the connection between land use and transportation .
i 'd say that most people have made the connection and that the one jay is proposing is just wrong .
then , of course , there is the apparently obligatory and generally clueless comment by stewart schwartz that such articles always seem to include .
in this case he makes the completely unsupported and obviously wrong statement that the conditions cited in the article leave everybody worse off .
if he wants to voice the opinion that the wrong people are making money in the wrong places , that 's different ;
but the claim that everybody is worse off is patently false and weakens the rest of his arguments accordingly .
as for conservation easements , do n't get me started .
when hundreds of organizations are founded to accept gifts from thousands of people , then stories like hyland 's are inevitable .
if conservationists want to conserve land , then they need to raise the money and go buy it .
that means that they will need to set priorities as to what land is most worth saving and give up on the idea of saving 95 % of it , for free .
or , we can come up with some method of providing continuing income to those that are already conserving the land .
a one shot , partial payment in the form a conservation easement can not possibly conserve the land forever .
even when land is publicly owned , we ca n't count on conservation continuing .
maryland has proposed selling land to raise money , fairfax to support affordable housing , and the vint hill economic development authority is arguably the largest developer in fauquier .
in a situation where the public c n't afford to keep their lands clear , what chance is there for the private individual ?
re : infrastructure costs and newcomers
all things being equal .. a newcomer in nova needs infrastructure to support them in not very different ways that - that same newcomer in the outer burbs would need similar infrastructure -
and it is the infrastructure costs that are much more at issue than density per se because discussions of density .. seem to always flow back to infrastructure and not focus on density itself as a good or bad thing .
if a newcomer did not have enough money to have a garage on their new house - people would be up in arms if their property taxes were taken to pay for that new garage but apparently folks ' views of this become less clear if we 're talking about taking people 's money to pay for .. say a new classroom .. or a new library or fire station or traffic light or widened roadways .
i think property owners are willing for the most part to pay their fair share -
but if the growth rate is high - where there is a huge influx of newcomers then we have significant money issues .
for instance , our locality has to build a new school every year and i understand that loudoun has to build several new schools every year .
schools are over 70 % of our property taxes .
without proffers - our taxes would have easily doubled and then some not to mention what would happen to the elected officials who approved those tax increases .
everyone needs a place to live
but i will point out that when a newcomer buys a home twice and three times as big as the typical house in the outer burbs .. commutes solo in a -lrb- usually new -rrb- suv 50 miles a day and then expects folks of much more modest means to pick up the infrastructure tab .. that there will be complaints .
`` another way of looking at this is that if new folks had to pay their actual share of infrastructure costs - there would be less money for bigger homes and new suv and long solo commutes . ''
and when we have all taxpayers picking up the tab for these infrastructure costs - there is no incentive on the part of the new folks - to make conservative financial decisions -
because , in essence , they are being subsididzed .
the more that each person has to pay their own fair share of infrastructure costs - the more it will impact the choices that have expensive consequences - for either them .. or for others .
i pointed out in another post the problems of planned communities .
there , the existing residents have not paid enough to support the common use land and common use infrastructure , with the result that these communities are now resorting to assessing additional fees , but only on newcomers .
in this case the newcomers are not causing any new requirements ,
but they are still being expected to pay a higher price than existing residents , and for facilites that were worn out -lrb- by existing residents -rrb- before the new residents arrived . it seems to me that this exposes a critical weakness in what we psychologically view as fair .
i would agree with larry if : a -rrb- existing residents were already paying enough to support existing infrastructure , which they are apparently not .
-lrb- at least that is a widely held belief . -rrb-
b -rrb- the additional costs -lrb- for proffers and such -rrb- over and above ordinary and sufficient property taxes were carefully examined to cover only the new and extraordinary capital costs associated solely with new residents .
that means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents .
say crime is up 50 % so you need a new jail .
at the same time new residents are planned to be up 25 % .
how much of the cost of the new jail should the new residents pay ?
are you going to hold them responsible for the 50 % of increased need that is due to existing residents ?
i understand larry 's point ,
but i think it is intellectually too easy to be correct .
i particularly like this : another way of looking at this is that if new folks had to pay their actual share of infrastructure costs - there would be less money for bigger homes and new suv and long solo commutes .
that is absolutely correct ,
and it corresponds to emr 's gloomy prediction that we will all face lowered expectations .
but what if the choice is a smaller home in the exurbs and a hybrid ?
it is a fine argument ,
but i do n't think we know anywhere near enough to actually and fairly assess the costs of new infrastructure , on the one hand .
on the other hand , if the newcomers pay for their own infrastructure , especially if we *require* them to pay for their own infrastructure , then we should not be too surprised if they claim to own it and wish to exclude us .
this has already happened with some gated communities .
they provided things like bike paths , and now the outside community wants connectivity to those assets without picking up part of the costs .
it is the same with riparian setbacks and other increased demands on private income or property .
i do n't see how we can expect it to be shared infrastructure that we all benefit from unless we share some of the costs .
at present , we ca n't even agree on what `` some of '' amounts to , let alone if it is a fair distribution .
what if the choice is between a larger home and an suv in the exurbs or a smaller home and maybe no car in the inner areas , and at a higher price , including travel ?
policy soup hsa a comment on the same subject that says , `` i lived in crystal city for many years after college .
the underground was , and remains , the greatest feature .
the only drawback to crystal city was no yards .
the location was great , but the place was too urban for anyone with a family .
the higher density development that has been going on there for the past five years or so is a crime -
you ca n't even cross the street on foot , everything is so congested !
so much for the `` pedestrian friendly '' model -
arlington seems determined to kill pedestrians , forcing people who used to walk to drive two blocks like in clarnedon due to overcrowding .
let 's pray they stop compounding their errors , lest the whole place decline . ''
it may turn out that we need more space not just to live and travel , but to make way for difference of opinion .
re : newcomers / infrastructure / longevity
well .. i do n't think infrastructure `` wears out '' in the usual sense but i do accept the premise for some things .
roads and water / sewer are not replaced .
they are , instead , maintained .
schools and prisons and other buildings can eventually wear out and need replacement .
but i am talking about new infrastructure that would not be needed if an area was not experiencing growth .
all communities have cips -lrb- capital investment plans -rrb- for infrastructure - both replacement and but replacement infrastructure is something that can be accomodated in an annual budget - much like figuring out how many buses the school system needs to replace - every year -
it 's a known calculation .
but new infrastructure is not because it depends on the rate of growth
and i think there would be strenuous disagreement with the claim that `` that means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents . ''
because existing residents are not getting `` better '' levels of services but rather expensive measures necessary to simply maintain their existing levels of service .
most communities would not willinging choose nor think fair that it is the existing residents ' financial responsibility to pay for new infrastructure for new residents .
remember , we 're not talking about a new classroom to replace the older , worn - out one .
we 're talking about a new additional classroom .

learning from the swedes reader rob jackson calls attention to an article in today 's wall street journal about the experiment in stockholm , sweden , with congestion pricing .
it seems that the swedes , for all their skill in urban planning and their investments in mass transit , are suffering from traffic congestion .
better yet , they 're adopting a market - driven remedy .
socialist though they may be , sweden 's politicians apparently have a firmer grasp of economics than virginia 's .
the greater stockholm region has nearly two million people .
the central city , built upon an archipelago of islands linked by bridges , is particularly prone to congestion .
under contract with ibm , the national government has set up 23 tolling points which , used in conjunction with transponder boxes , laser detectors and cameras , tracks the path of every car in the city .
each time a car with a transponder passes through a toll , the charge is automatically deducted from the driver 's bank account .
tolls vary at different times of the day according to the level of congestion , ranging from the equivalent of $ 1.38 to $ 2.76 per hour .
the goal was to alter motorist behavior -- and that 's exactly what has happened .
rather than drive to and from work at the same time every day , some stockholmites -lrb- stockholmers ? -rrb- are varying their commuting times .
some are taking different routes .
some are riding bicycles .
and many are availing themselves of mass transit .
as the wsj explains : before the trial began , stockholm spent about $ 180 million on improvements to public transportation .
it bought about 200 new buses and added rush - hour trains , express bus routes and more park - and - ride lots .
but the changes had little impact on the number of people who left their private cars at home .
in spring 2006 , however , during the trial , use of all forms of public transportation jumped 6 % and ridership on inner - city bus routes rose 9 % , compared with a year earlier .
now that the six - month trial has ended , the city has scheduled a referendum to let voters decide whether to make the congestion - pricing scheme permanent .
a june poll found that 52 percent of voters favored the plan .
so far , the idea of congestion pricing in virginia has n't gotten past the talking stage .
oh yeah -- a system that tracks every car 's movements through transponders will go over with the public in va .
there remain people who wo n't buy smarttags because they do n't want big brother to have the data -lrb- or their spouse 's divorce lawyer . -rrb-
it strikes me as remarkable that our transportation policies are more socialistic than sweden 's .
we wo n't do photo red , and you are suggesting this ?
anonymous , i do n't believe that the swedish system requires people to install transponders .
some people will prefer that option because it 's more convenient .
jim : wapo ran the wall street journal story on d 5 of business .
anonymous 11:06 see our comment yesterday re anonymity .
citizens can have functional transport , functional settlement patterns , functional governance and a sustainable civilization ;
or they can , to protect cheating husbands and wives and others for whom secrecty is a way to preserve special privilage , obsess over private rights to the exclusion of public responsibilities .
emr
by all accounts the stockholm experiment has been a success , so far .
three issues come to mind .
first , stockholm spent $ 180 million on transportation improvements before the experiment .
would the experiment have been as successful if they had not spent the money ?
was the `` success '' a manufactured result to cover up for the previously failed investment ?
second , stockholm had the presence of mind and the fairness of government to put this together as an experiment , and allow the citizens to dismantle it later if they thought it not worthwhile .
that is an admirable approach ,
what us government has ever incorporated a policy as a test and then put it up for referendum ?
one of our problems is that having made a mistake , it is impossible to get the government to own up to it .
where is the referendum on whether we should spend umpteen billion on the tyson 's project ?
focus groups and special interests do n't count .
third , granted , the government in stockholm has every incentive to spin this in a good light ,
and all the reviews seem good .
i 'm suspicious when no one seems to be able to find any shortcomings .
in london , it took quite some time for the economic effects to sort themselves out and be measured .
although the london experiment also seems to be a success , there is considerable movement against it and the rapid rise in tolling charges that followed .
it does not seem likely that it will be repeated in other english cities .
for the record , i 'm in favor of congestion tolling , but i also think it will hasten the de-emphasis of central areas .
in london there seems to be a distinct decrease in business just inside the edge of the congestion zone and a distinct increase just outside .
it is too soon to see what happens in stockholm ,
but the situation in stockholm is a lot different from london .
singapore is another example of effective use of congestion pricing .
i 'm not usre that there 's much about singapore 's governmental philosophy that we should emulate -lrb- thinly disguised one - party rule -rrb- but , as someone who has spent a great deal of time there over the past 20 years , i can testify that traffic in the center city is much improved without any indication that economic development has been curtailed .
in southern california , there are at least two tollways with variable pricing that fluctuates with traffic density .
the highway design is configured to give drivers options about whether to pay the higher rates or get off the road .
seems to work .
re : congestion pricing and `` edge '' impacts .
simple - move the boundaries ... :--rrb-
further , let 's think outside the box here .
what makes `` congestion pricing '' - work ?
it 's electronic tolling .
`` congestion pricing '' is but one of dozens of possible outcomes based on the underlying technology .
the privacy aspects are undeniable but the momentum towards electronic tolling is also .
right now .. they can `` track '' you with your cell phone and your credit card as well as red - light cameras and even security cameras in businesses .
electronic tolling will make possible other methods of collecting revenue from vehicular travel besides congestion pricing .
obviously new roads / expanded / improved roads will also be possible - roads that we currently have no money for and unlikely to have money for in the near future .
electronic tolls present an opportunity to build new roads shortly after the study / decision is made - vice waiting for years .. and in vdot 's case decades .
the primary difference between this country and other countries ' use of electronic tolling is that we 're still thinking of individual roads whereas those other countries are implementing electronic tolling for the region - as a way to shape the entire network 's congestion .
so .. think in terms of the entire nova area with a connecting network of electronically tolled roads being priced by the hour ... and the place much like cell phone minutes .
you have to admit - the cell phone business model does two things very , very well .
first , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and second , the cell companies collect enough in revenues to keep building more cell towers and expand coverage .
think about the same model with roads and electronic tolling .
larry , the cell phone analogy is brilliant .
that is the logic of where the technology will take us -- if only politics do n't stand in the way .
either nova scout is right or larry is right .
congestion pricing does n't seem to have limited singapore 's economic activity , but how would you know ?
for one thing , it 's like traffic congestion :
the demand is so high that even if you build new roads or throttle the demand , it is still high .
for another , if larry is right and congestion pricing has shaped the region , then some of that economic activity is not happening where it might have otherwise .
transportation is very closey connected with economic activity .
so in that sense , what tolling does is impose a tax on profits that have not yet been made .
i think you should tax only income and sales , but i suppose you could rationalize this as a sales tax on use of the roads .
i still think there is no reason to institute tolling except in special circumstances : expensive bridges , and highly congested zones , for example .
otherwise a gas tax set high enough to do its job is still a fairer and cheaper method , and more environmentally friendly :
the infrastructure is in place , and it automatically taxes by distance , weight , and horsepower .
the cell phone analogy is far from brilliant .
there are multiple cell phone companies -lrb- verizon wireless , cingular , sprint , tmobile , etc. -rrb- .
there is only one medieval and corrupt general assembly .
and their goal was , is and will remain the transfer of wealth from the economically successful -lrb- and congetsed -rrb- areas to those areas of the state locked in the economic practices of the mid 1800s .
this will not end until the dillon rule is discarded in virginia or northern virginia forms a separate state .
congestion `` pricing '' = congestion `` taxation '' .
if you want to continue the cell phone analogy then maryland ought to have a chance to propose their approach to traffic management using northern virginia 's taxes as a competitive alternative to the general assembly 's proposal .
the people of northern virginia -lrb- i.e. the buyers of the product offered under congestion `` pricing '' -rrb- would then have a choice - like they do today with cell phone service .
until there is choice , this is just another method of perpetuating the northern virginia subsidy of the southern virginia welfare state .
no thanks .
groveton , you 're missing the point of larry 's post regarding the cell phone model :
`` first , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and second , the cell companies collect enough in revenues to keep building more cell towers and expand coverage . ''
how does the presence of absence of competition affect either of those two attributes ?
as for the `` medieval corrupt '' general assembly , do n't forget which region of the state sends more senators and delegates to that body than any other .
as we 've discussed elsewhere on this blog , the transfer of wealth between regions is accounted for primarily by the `` standards of quality '' funding formula that redistributes resources from affluent school systems to poor school systems , and secondarily by road - funding formulas that favor rural areas .
your criticisms should be directed to those two particular funding formulas , not to the `` general assembly '' as a whole .
northern virginia 's gripes over these funding formulas could be shared by the affluent suburbs of the richmond area --
but you do n't hear richmond suburbanites fantasizing about seceding from the state .
-lrb- for the record : i live in henrico county . -rrb-
some northern virginians want it both ways .
they 're entirely happy with the arrangement that divests it from any responsibility for the `` inner city '' of e washington , d.c. , and all those icky poor people ,
and they would like to divest itself from responsibility for outlying rural areas as well .
in other words , these people advocate cherry picking the most affluent suburban jurisdictions of nova , creating a separate political entity for themselves and insulating themselves from the urban and rural poor .
a gated community on a regional scale !
jim , is n't that what congestion pricing does , place a toll gate on the community ?
ray , congestion pricing uses the pricing mechanism to allocate scarce roadway capacity .
if you want to call that `` placing a toll gate on the community , '' i suppose you can .

only time right now for some quick thoughts on haditha .
or rather , haditha 's elevation as iraq 's official , bad apple atrocity .
even for those who try to pay attention to what filters through the fog of war crimes , these things tend to run together .
haditha is n't abu sifa where , according to iraqi police , us forces '' on a rampage '' executed a family of 11 , then bombed their house , burned their cars and slaughtered their animals .
what more will we hear of abu sifa , now haditha has become the representative and inevitable example of honour 's exception ?
because along with haditha comes jesse macbeth , allegedly a former army ranger and iraq war veteran , whose claims that massacre was method rather than madness rapidly went viral on the net .
his story was unsubstantiated and exteme , yet plausible because it was extreme , and provided a template to the pattern of force on exhibit in iraq .
a pattern rarely admitted by the west 's institutional media .
but macbeth , it now appears , is the pentagon 's timely strawman to buttress its case for haditha 's exceptionalism , and to discredit influential anti-war voices such as iraq veterans against the war .
whether unaware or not of his status as a cointelpro asset , it does n't matter ,
because regardless , macbeth became a lucky charm for those who refuse to believe the program of horror in which us troops are engaged ,
and there are many .
similar stories may now be said to have been `` debunked , '' without examination or a straining of battlefield ethics .
it was a scandal 20 years ago when ronald reagan - the bush family 's post-hinkley zombie - in - chief - honoured the ss dead at bitburg , and by turn paid homage to the old fascist `` anti-communist '' front of the republican heritage groups council .
it was , perhaps , merely a prefigurement of the nazi stain in america 's own blood cult , and what should be a crisis of conscience on memorial day .
on supposedly progressive forums i 've seen many apologies for haditha , and for the other hadithas still cloaked in denial .
do n't judge the troops too quickly , or too harshly , some write ,
because `` hell is full of heroes . ''
heaven , meanwhile , fills with children .
there is no decent place to stand , not in a massacre .

with attitudes like that , there truly is no hope for this planet anymore .
we might as well push the reboot button right now .
`` hell is full of heroes ''
what the fuck does that mean ?
is this a good thing ?
is slaughtering people a good thing ?
and what 's anonymous on about ?
`` grow up
and quit bitchin '' ?
do we roll over and say this sort of thing is okay just because the ' current economic models ' say so ?

i think for most americans the sanctity of the god - fearing soldier going out and making the world right is too near and dear a concept . `` support the troops , not the regime ''
that 's a noble idea until you 're supporting the weight of an armoured vehicle on your chest .
the disallusionment of this country is progressing apace and i sense the growing desperation as people realize that just believing we 're on the right side might not necessarily make it so .
the first `` anonymous '' poster here is certainly a fellow with his own screwed up head stick up his own disgusting ass .
i also think his own understanding of the artistic works he references - francisco goya 's disasters of war and caputo 's book -- is also supremely naive .
i suggest he take an elementary course in art appreciation at his local university or community college .

the anonymous at 2:52 pm , albeit lobotomized by the iron triangle 's propaganda , hit upon a major point we should all be aware of .
iraq , or iran for that matter , are just foreplay .
the real act occurs when the empire takes on china .
the only way an industrial power can take on another with ten times its population base is by using what it thinks is its overwhelming advantage .
that would be a massive nuclear strike , incincerating all opposition before it could mobilize , and using its new warfighter technology to mop up everything else .
in the long run , it may be that the middle eastern conflagrations are designed to harden the american people to the inevitability of genocide .
not that it really is inevitable : but it would make ruling a whole lot easier for a government controlled by the military front of the world 's largest private equity firm .
'' .. when the police state crushes his family , .. ''
the problem with that catchy idea is that the participants of empire are mostly assured they have a safe haven *when* the bottom falls out or assume they do more so than smuks like me or you .
let 's face it :
money buys some security ;
a lot of money buys a lot of security ,
and those that have access to it know what 's going on and have made plans accordingly .
unfortunately anon 2:52 is n't that far off in twilight zone kind of way -
although i do not agree with h / hr ethic morality , there are too many people on earth right now ,
that is , if they all want to have a car and drive to the mall - and a lot of them are waking up to that idea , which , as it stands now , is impossible .
his nonchelant benign god force mannerism is appalling and is apparent in the neo-con world of the project for a new american century , which if i 'm not mistaken , did address the issues of exactly what is being said here .
anotherwords : you are either with us or against us .
even if you 're with us you might die a horrible death , but you still have a chance albeit a minor one .
to paraphrase : `` they who hold the gold , makes the rules .
those who hold the gold and the guns make the reality . ''
from lrc blog :
a breakdown in thinking
posted by butler shaffer at 12:53 pm
news reports inform us that american military officials are now convinced that a unit of marines killed some 24 unarmed iraqis , including women and six children .
some of the victims had been shot `` execution style . ''
one government official stated that this atrocity showed `` a total breakdown in morality . ''
what on earth do these officials think all war is , if not a `` breakdown in morality ? ''
if the systematic slaughter of tens or hundreds of thousands of human beings does n't represent a `` breakdown in morality , '' what does ?
do we have to wait for some major offense , such as illicit sex in the oval office ?
i would go even further than this :
`` war is the mobilization of immorality . ''
would these apologists for such killings have been satisfied if the same deaths to the same innocents had been brought about by aerial bombs ?
i am reminded of a distinction one of my students tried making a few years ago in contrasting suicide bombers with militarily disciplined killing :
`` at least we have the decency to drop bombs from airplanes , '' he declared .
i wonder what kind of spin the twits at faux news are putting on this for their audience of the bloodthirsty !
on this memorial day weekend , it would be worthwhile for americans - whose government is running this abattoir - to recognize the immorality of their support for such madness .
those who wave their flags , or emblazon their cars with `` support the troops '' messages , are as much to blame for this so - called `` breakdown in morality '' as anyone else .
out of a sense of moral decency , this weekend might be an appropriate occasion to remove such symbols from their cars , homes , and - better yet - their minds !
question : did u.s. troops in ww2 shoot children while their mothers tried to shield them , screaming for mercy ?
remember maggot , the telly savalas rapist - character from `` the dirty dozen ? ''
jim brown machine - gunned him for messing with a german woman in a simple act of field justice .
that sort of moral action seemed fairly unremarkable to people back then .
fast - forward to today 's gi : innured to violence by a lifetime of ultra-violent `` kill bill '' movies , ultra-violent fps video games , he has become the thing an earlier generation was taught was most detestable : a nazi storm trooper , a self - appointed ss death 's - head executioner .
bereft of any sense of the sacred , he shoots little girls without compunction .
he is , quite literally , insane , a `` natural born killer . ''
these atavistic carrion - birds surely will come home to roost ,
and one thing seems undeniable :
it 's not going to be pretty when they do .
i do n't just mean the troops returning from iraq : i mean the whole malevolent culture of death .
go for a drive in any u.s. city
and witness the seething hatred americans have for each other .
`` your streets will be smeared with blood , '' as the prophecy has it .
a society built on lies , where respect for human life is absent , where every media outlet mirrors the bloodlust , is a society doomed .
`` and what rough beast , its hour come round at last ? ''
iraq has been a training ground .
sane people come home scarred for life from such a place .
the real psychopaths graduate to high paying private security contractor jobs and are destined to become the praetorian guard for the new world order .
on that last video game piece , i just posted a comment , referring to a serial killer toy set .
and an article about it .
the article was written 17 years ago about a kid who was not yet near puberty .
kind of bart or lisa 's age back in the days of the original simpsons .
the kid who bought that toy would be in their mid to late 20s right now , possibly with a tour or two of iraq under their belts .
it 's not the `` kill bills '' or the video games that cause this bullshit , not even serial killer toys .
it 's the lack of true culture and connection to anything that really fucks things up .
it 's not the movies ... or the games .
that is it .
after all , all life is sacred .
or none .
there is no middle ground .
-lrb- ps i am a carnivore ,
things die for me to live .
the life they had is sacred too . -rrb-
to all of you who have never been in a war ....
there is no morality in war . ''
i heard a ww2 vet say this tonight .
could n't agree more .
it 's one good reason why wars should be last resorts instead of the cool graphics embellished infotainment spectacles that they are .
it 's also why the ultimate responsibility for this lies at washington 's doorstep .
& , ultimately , at our doorsteps . washington sold us a bill of goods
& we were too damn lazy to uncover the bill of goods .
hell , i bet more americans do more research to buy a f*cking clothes dryer than they did before they bought this war , hook line & sinker .
of course , a lot of americans have flip flopped over to the against column .
i just hope they do n't try to scapegoat these boys for acting badly in reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaal goddamn bad situation that we sent them into .
& i do mean we .
i thought this was a bad idea from the start ,
but what did i do to stop it ?
wrote my representatives & garnered a collection of condescending form `` you just do n't understand the situation '' letters in return , signed a couple of petitions marched in a march .......
woo - fucking - woo .
in other words , i did n't do shit .
but then , neither did anyone else .
you do n't have to be drunk to cause a car accident .
when roman soldiers asked john the baptist how should they prepare themselves for this messiah in the book of luke , john responded , '' do not terrify men with a view to extortion , neither accuse anyone falsely ;
and be content with your wages .
for an excellent exposure of chinese communism go to www.ninecommentaries.com
the following four paragraphs are taken from this website .
for the chinese communists killing is also necessary for practical reasons .
the communist party began as a group of thugs and scoundrels who killed to obtain power .
once this precedent was set , there was no going back .
constant terror was needed to intimidate people and force them to accept , out of fear , the absolute rule of the chinese communist party .
in a normal society , people show care and love for one another , hold life in awe and veneration and give thanks to god .
in the east , people say , `` do not impose on others what you would not want do to yourself . ''
in the west , people say , `` love thy neighbor as thyself . ''
conversely , the ccp holds that `` the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . ''
in order to keep alive the `` struggles '' within society , hatred must be generated .
not only does the ccp take lives , it encourages people to kill each other .
it strives to desensitize people towards others ' suffering by surrounding them with constant killing .
it wants them to become numb from frequent exposure to inhumane brutality , and develop the mentality that `` the best you can hope for is to avoid being persecuted . ''
all these lessons taught by brutal suppression enable the ccp to maintain its rule .
in addition to the destruction of countless lives , the ccp also destroyed the soul of the chinese people .
a great many people have become conditioned to react to the ccp 's threats by entirely surrendering their reason and their principles .
in a sense , these people 's souls have died - something more frightening than physical death .
back in 1903 , yale divinity school established a number of schools and hospitals throughout china that were collectively known as ' yale in china . '
one of ' yale in china 's ' most important students was mao zedong .
during world war ii , ' yale in china ' was a primary instrument used by the u.s. establishment and its office of strategic services -lrb- oss -rrb- to install the maoists into power .
' yale in china ' was run by oss operative reuben holden , the husband of bush 's cousin , and also a member of the skull and bones .
`` yale in china '' was also closely associated with the new york - based union theological seminary , which has been a center for u.s. subversion of asia .
`` the maoists made china into the world 's largest opium producer . ''
according to kathy griggs , this revolutionary terrorist group is controlling the marines and army .
they all operate together .
they actually promoted communists in the oss , which was started by william donovan .
so they promote and use communists , who actually want to get rid of the form of u.s. government as a stepping stone to world domination .
so this group , now , in the army and marine corp. has communists at the very top .
one example of this truth is the goings on at abu ghraib u.s. military prison , which is located twenty miles west of baghdad .
a large percent of prisoners there have not commited any criminal acts agaisnt the coalition .
the military has a policy of `` random sweeps '' whenever the base is under attack .
they gather all men in the area between the ages 17 for questioning to abu ghraib prison .
after finding out the men 's innocence they are slated for release .
but because of military bureaucracy this can be as long as one year .
general kapinski states in the `` taguba report '' section 24 -lrb- u -rrb- that as many as 60 percent of abu ghraib prisoners are not guilty of any crimes committed agaisnt the coalition .
the release of these innocent prisoners was denied by general majowski 2nd in command in iraq .
on the internet type iraq : beyond abu ghraib : detention and torture in iraq .
this is the amnesty international report .
also the february 2004 international red cross report section 7 which states that 70 to 90 percent of all prisoners held at abu ghraib were innocent .
to announce that there must be no criticism of the president , or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong , is not only unpatriotic , and servile , but is morally treasonable to the american public .
- theodore roosevelt -
perhaps the whole reason mao did his thing was because he was against what he learnt from `` yale in china '' .
perhaps he was trying to destroy the influence of a group he felt were trying to rule the world .
just a thought .
probably wrong , but maybe not .
one practical result of mao was the cultural revolution .
this probably severed the chinese zeitgeist from its cultural and spiritual base .
its 's easier to commit atrocities in the name of power in this way imo , well easier to motivate others to do it for you .
disconnection from the source .
yet again .
`` a pattern rarely admitted by the west 's institutional media . ''
rarely admitted that we follow that pattern too .
its 's always others elsewhere that do that evil stuff .
there seems to be a trend of this sort .
this guy -lrb- macbeth , great name -rrb- and 911 show a similar pattern .
there is -lrb- potentially -rrb- an ugly truth , either us military violence against civilians , or us admin complicity or responsibility for violence against its own and foreign civilians -lrb- in the wtc , pentagon and various aircraft -rrb- .
extreme sensationalist claims surface that may be true -lrb- no jews died in the wtc -rrb- others events that are confirmed , like the van full of israelis , are shown to be true and suddenly the claim seems even more plausible .
that claim is then exposed as crap , and particularly offensive crap at that , -lrb- especially if you are related to some of the dead jewish paople from the wtc -rrb- .
other amazing , hard to credit claims follow , the planes were holograms , or were n't there or whatever .
and the money trail , or the stupidities , like the finding of a highjacker 's passport in the rubble within 12 hours of the event , or the reports of the seattle mayor being warned not to fly to the east coast on 911 , or the bin ladens ' charter flight out of the us during the `` no fly '' period ; all that disappears under the weight of scorn flung at the claims that are wrong .
here we will show you the truth , but only in a form you can not possibly believe .
very clever .
so instead of thousands of us soldiers snapping and killing the odd iraqi civillian , or five . we have claims that many or all us soldiers are murdering iraqis by the hundreds .
if that was the case there would be fuck all people left in iraq .
obviously crap , spoken by a nutter , anything he says or anything that comes from a similar place belongs in the same file `` batshit crazy rubbish designed to discredit us '' .
truth is soldiers do horrible things in war .
things they would probably have never thought themselves capable of .
most western armies probably do try to moderate this , just for pr reasons and political ones .
but i bet such concerns are far from the minds of military leaders who can not be bothered to equip or supply their own troops properly .
if the army is disciplined and honourable it is designed to prevent such excesses , designed to produce fearsome perfect warriors who will kill you in a million different ways , but only if you are evil and fight them .
pity those armies only exist in niave children 's imaginations , or fantasy novels set in mythical worlds .
all this babbling here will remedy nothing .
ask god 's forgiveness .
get out while you can .
revelation 18 : 18:1 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ;
and the earth was lightened with his glory .
18:2 and he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
18:3 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication ,
and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
18:4 and i heard another voice from heaven , saying , come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
18:5 for her sins have reached unto heaven , and god hath remembered her iniquities .
here we go again ...
remember : there is no conspiracy .
let 's go over this article slowly , shall we ?
first of all , every war has its share of atrocities and massacres , on both sides .
to think otherwise is to be totally naive and uninformed .
wait , that is a good definition of the american public in general --
but that 's another story .
a few examples of this .
the boer war : first case of concentration camps , run by the british to exterminate rebels fighting against the british empire .
wwi saw regular massacres of unarmed german soldiers who had surrendered to the allies .
wwii saw the bombing of dresden , a target with very little military importance , and home to thousands of refugees .
berlin was sacked and thousands of german women raped by the red army in 1945 .
korea witnessed several civilian massacres .
vietnam had my lai , and the tiger force .
so , today , there are massacres in iraq ?
the cynic in me just replies : `` and this is ... news ? '' .
repeat after me , people :
if dumb - as - bricks americans did not want their precious military to be sullied by civilian massacres , they should not have given president `` w '' bush the right to invade .
except very few american citizens had the courage to stand and protest .
and , you mean , the army is now trying to hide the horrible , horrible fact that dozens , maybe hundreds of civilians were murdered in cold blood by us soldiers ?
and this is a conspiracy ?
wake up , people !
ever since war exists -lrb- meaning : the dawn of time -rrb- , civilians have been brutalized , raped , tortured and murdered ,
and the higher - ups have covered this by saying drivel and b*llshit such as : `` we do n't torture people in america . ''
-lrb- actual presidential quote -rrb- .
please , people , there is no conspiracy here : just a bunch of morons , realizing they have unleashed horror on innocents and trying to cover their asses .
why do you think only lowly soldiers and no generals have been convicted ?
because generals have the power , that 's why !
so , one soldier stood up and talked about some razed shithole in iraq ?
maybe he is going overboard and creating a fancy tale of horror ?
so what ?
that 's not a cover - up , that 's just some dumb -- and scarred for life -- white trash making shit up .
of course , the us military is going to jump at the chance to sweep the real skeletons under the carpet , so to speak .
business as usual , and war is good business .
nothing to see here , people , move along .
this is the result of more than 60 years of military conditioning .
in wwii , most of the soldiers refused to shoot at people , and shot either in the air or -- at least -- above the heads of enemy soldiers .
in iraq , well - conditioned army psychopaths are going to shoot at everything that moves .
you do n't like it ?
too bad , you voted for the moron .
twice .
one last time :
repugnant ?
yes .
disgusting ?
yes .
obvious ?
yes .
conspiracy ?
no .
it 's just the normal m.o. of the biggest military machine ever created on earth .
yay , usa !
home of the psychos and land of the militaro - industrial complex !
all praise god , and pass the ammo , we are going to smoke ourselves some iraqis !
all in the name of god , and freedom , and democracy , and justice , and a foetus ! -lrb- as bill hicks would say -rrb-
40 years from now , more horrors , more massacres are going to be unearthed ...
no conspiracy here , people ,
probably just in time for the next senseless war .
the dumbs leading the sheeps is more like it .
some mapmakers draw their conclusions on time and space with civil holidays spread out neatly across the spectrum .
there is no `` now '' in remembrance day or groundhog day or memorial day or any other icon of days .
now is not the reason why we have the icon of days .
now is silent and the landscaape is mindscape is timescape is sanctified .
sure you can protest rembembrance day .
just do n't wear a poppy .
now that 's making a statement .
da : speaking of `` razed shitholes in iraq '' is employing the language of dehumanization , yes ?
is a razed shithole in iraq terribly different from a razed shithole in , say , waco , texas ?
please do n't forget that the iraqis never did anything to us 'ns .
we 're the bully in their yard ,
and might makes right in the doublespeak of the fascisti .
`` profits , not people , '' dude .
in your little history lesson -lrb- why not go back to the romans who slaughtered everyone in carthage , or , for that matter , the israelites in the ot , commanded by yawheh to slaughter man , women , and child ? -rrb- , you mention the bombing of dresden .
i 'll toss in hiroshima and nagasaki ,
but those pilot - murderers were at one remove from the slaughter they were , uh , enabling :
they did n't have to look at the mother trying to shield her kids before pulling the trigger .
obviously , the pilots did n't think too much about what was happening on the ground , or they would lose their minds -lrb- their souls had already been burned away , whether they knew it or not -rrb- .
i 'm sure there were gis shooting innocents in ww2 ,
but that kind of atrocity is not emblamatic of the war , in the way that napalm drops and tiger teams are emblamatic of vietnam , and fallujah and abu graib and hadifa will be emblamatic of iraq .
denying the effects of violent culture is denying the effects of operant conditioning .
yes , at the root of our monstrous age is the loss of any sense of the sacred , or , more specifically , the acute sense that humans are created in the image of god and that god is very much real and keeping notes ,
but surely one step towards rediscovering human dignity is acknowledging that culture matters .
no one `` turns off the tv '' before first realizing that tv is unhealthy -lrb- jerry mander 's book is brilliant in this regard -rrb- , just as no one will `` avert their eyes from the imperium '' without realizing that empire - worship is nothing but moloch - worship .
moloch ?
indeed .
as mother teresa put it , `` if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child , how can we tell people not to kill one another ?
any country that accepts abortion , is not teaching its people to love , but to use any violence to get what it wants . ''
ouch !
religiosity !
but most certainly the u.s. is `` using any violence to get what it wants , '' and has been for a long time .
hey , the undead like cal thomas say , `` it 's the cost of freedom . ''
freedom to do what -- obey ?
i like edward abbey 's quote -lrb- and we miss you , ed -rrb- :
`` freedom begins between your ears . ''
'nuff said .

your conclusion is just plain wrong .
stan goff on them `` rogue apples '' :

what kind of god sits idly by while its progeny suffers miserably and needlessly ?
step back and think how cruel this son of a bitch must be , if you believe in such a thing .
god , the concept , may play a part in this , but only insofar as it is used to justify the killing .
but please do n't insult our intelligence by claiming all of this could be mitigated if we just worshipped some god more frequently and properly .

anonymous 3:10pm said heaven is filled with children ... and the people who were not afraid to protect them at any cost .
so , by definition , your precious god is not there with them in heaven , since he failed to protect them at all costs , or any cost , for that matter .
is cost even relevant to this god of yours ?
either way , your god is disqualified by your qualifications for entrance into heaven .
i have a couple of questions .
is harry truman in heaven ?
was pat benatar incorrect when she said `` hell is for children ? ''
hear , hear .
start making the connections , people , between http://www.abortionno.org/resources/pictures_2.html this and http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41186000/jpg/_41186472_kar-child-ap416.jpg this :
that 's what ' intuition ' is all about ...
dude .
pat benatar ?
hell is paved with the skulls of crapazoid musicians like her .
question for you .
was the ot formulation ' what is hateful to you do not do to others ' a fairly rad concept for humans in 1000 bc ?
or do you think it normal for that time and place ?
and why did the israelites embrace and defend their silly silly little torah for lo those many centuries , beset as they were on all sides by truly blood - thirsty pagans ?
how did they do it ?
was it the yoghurt ?
was it dumb luck ?
why defend as a paramount rule what amounts to rather remarkable humanism ?
explain the evolutionary biology behind that one , please , and , since you 've set the terms of the debate , leave god out of it .
good luck .
as for me , i think if people and their governors were enlightened enough to follow that one tenet of judaism -lrb- or the christian or buddhist formulation -rrb- , we 'd all be a lot better off .
oh stop with blaming god for the shithole humanity has made of this world --
all of you who 'd like to bash god or demons or angels or aliens need to look into the mirror to find out why the ground you walk on is cursed .
`` god '' never did shit to you that you know of ,
but you 're quick to blame him for your fucked up life .

`` deal with it , '' apparently means `` cheerleadng from the bleachers . ''
if right and wrong actually exist , then it 's wrong .
at least a soldier on a battlefield has the excuse that he was following orders , or that in a free - fire zone he could n't tell the guys in the black hats from the guys in the white hat , because accidents fucking happen .

you 're not merely wrong , not merely insane , you 're actively fucking evil .
if someone close to you dies in one silly - ass war for the juice to run your suv , or you find yourself sitting in a homeless shelter , or standing on a streetcorner and panhandling for change from strangers who could n't give two shits for you , because the fat slobs who run your company decided to outsource your job to people who will work twice as long and hard as you do for a tenth the pay , your credit rating is in negative numbers and your new address is `` no fixed address , '' then i pray that i 'm there when someone repeats those exact same words to you .

for the record , how can i blame something if i do n't acknowledge its existence .
i believe there is something more than me , or us , but what that something constitutes is pure conjecture .

a time - honored strategy to control the masses .
david koresh may very well be the next christ figure several hundred years from now ,

forget ' isms ' -- except eclecticism
those discrete movements you studied in art history ?
they 're long gone .
today , it 's all about diversity -- and quality , of course .
by christopher knight -lrb- from la times -rrb-
the question was innocent enough .
`` what 's going on with contemporary art these days ? ''
my answer was equally candid .
`` beats me . ''
i do spend a sizable chunk of my time looking at , reading about and thinking over new art in los angeles and elsewhere ,
but the days when a succinct response might quickly sum up the art scene are long gone .
partly that 's because contemporary art has gone global .
the decade of the 1980s was a pivot , when new york 's postwar role as serious art 's only serious city came to an end .
mostly , though , it 's because art , wherever it is made , no longer subscribes to a single dominant trend with a few rambunctious alternatives jostling for supremacy .
art is eclectic --
and today we take that eclecticism for granted .
look around .
the extreme breadth of artistic diversity is so familiar and so routine as to border on invisibility .
take the 2006 california biennial at the orange county museum of art , opening today .
it is typical of most such surveys , which are commonplace in an art scene now sprawling from berlin to beijing .
this installment includes jane callister 's punchy abstract paintings , which skillfully exploit the capacity of paint to multi-task .
like a diary , her paint records the artist 's physical process in making the work .
it also has a tendency to run , mix or separate of its own accord , as if an inert material made from pigment bound in acrylic resin had an independent mind and will .
and it possesses a stubborn inclination to represent recognizable things in the world -- especially landscape -- in wholly unexpected , even apocalyptic ways .
but the california biennial , without seeming the least bit dissonant , can also accommodate art with no relationship whatever to callister 's inventive reworking of postwar abstraction 's various shibboleths .
there 's the show business shtick of the performance troupe my barbarian , which turns homemade riffs on tv and broadway into political entertainment .
mario ybarra jr. once fabricated vato action figure dolls , transforming gang - culture imagery into icons of duchampian hip - hop .
and the architectural photographs of precarious or ruined buildings by amir zaki assert that disintegration and collapse are the inescapable , unseen corollary of the lovely pictures found in our ubiquitous shelter magazines .
speaking of buildings , for a current show in pasadena , carlos mollura has inserted polyethylene cubes , spheres and other geometric shapes into architectural orifices at a colorado boulevard shopping plaza .
as each fat , inflatable form strains against the buildings ' walls and windows with playful , even comic authority , empty space becomes elastic , muscular and apparently ready to burst .
geometry is ostensibly neutral .
but in the context of this shopping arcade , these geometric forms inescapably imply that hidden powers of urban gentrification are at work .
at blum & poe gallery at the edge of culver city , meanwhile , a carved lump of luxurious sandstone by matt johnson begins with michelangelo 's renaissance dictum that sculpture is a spiritually inclined process of chipping away stone to liberate a natural life force already locked inside .
johnson put his chisel to work ,
but he uncovered something quite different .
a bleary death 's head lurked within .
moreover , the skull 's distended features recall a famous 1943 bronze memento mori by picasso , who revolutionized sculpture for the 20th century .
johnson , metaphorically killing off two artistic titans in one deceptively simple gesture , achieves quite a sculptural feat .
katie grinnan 's sculpture at acme follows an entirely different track .
her `` rubble division '' mixes such disparate materials as ink - jet prints pasted on board , foam rubber , galvanized steel , concrete , steel rebar and bungee cords .
folding and unfolding pictures of ruined buildings with pictures of vernacular modern architecture , she articulates a disorienting collision between the material world and virtual reality .
the sculpture -- tall and gangly , with angular flaps held precariously in place by tension cords -- looks like a cross between a communications satellite and a homeless shelter scavenged from a freeway underpass .
what 's going on with contemporary art these days ?
clearly a lot .
yet callister , my barbarian , ybarra and zaki comfortably cohabit in a single group show .
mollura , johnson and grinnan are all first - rate sculptors ,
and none makes sculpture that even remotely recalls the others .
their disparate works cover the waterfront .
many of these artists do evoke a world coming apart at the seams .
-lrb- given current events , how could they not ? -rrb-
but the stresses and strains of contemporary life register in heterogeneous ways .
and their extreme eclecticism is not exclusive to california .
it 's the norm everywhere today . ' pluralism ' does n't do it justice
i use the word `` eclectic '' rather than `` pluralist '' for a reason .
eclecticism is a virtue because not only does it draw from a variety of sources and promote divergent positions , it also makes an argument about what is best among the various doctrines , methods or styles it employs .
eclecticism is elitist in the finest sense of that widely misused word , which has nothing to do with old - fashioned notions of exclusive aristocratic taste and everything to do with embracing diversity while also demanding quality .
in the 1980s some critics advanced pluralism as art 's natural condition .
they were partly right .
the idea that two or more kinds of ultimate artistic reality could comfortably coexist has n't always been in vogue .
twentieth century art was long charted as an almost linear succession of `` isms '' -- from fauvism in 1905 to abstract expressionism in the 1950s -- discrete movements that each expressed its own unitary view of things .
the monolithic view that had congealed by the 1960s was a belief that the eye held dominion over art .
that limited judgment was toppled by conceptualism , which devalued everything visual in art and instead polished up the stature of ideas .
`` the idea becomes the machine that makes the art , '' sol lewitt famously wrote in 1967 to explain conceptual art .
and the idea could range far and wide , encompassing virtually any subject , attitude or experience one might imagine .
looking back from today 's art world , though , a slightly different history of eclectic art suggests itself .
conceptual art does n't mark the decisive break , just the elaboration and consolidation of an idea already in play .
pop art marks the most profound rupture .
the landmark exhibition of robert rauschenberg 's 1950s hybrids of painting and sculpture that closed recently at the museum of contemporary art convinced me of that .
rauschenberg , together with jasper johns , set the stage for pop .
their work undermined art 's established structure .
pop art tipped it over .
with its commercial subject matter , pitch - perfect sense of style , wicked humor , easy sociability and serious refusal to take art too seriously , pop made hash of the rigid hierarchy of high art -lrb- painting , sculpture , drawing -rrb- and low art -lrb- tv , tabloids , photographs -rrb- .
an entrenched legacy of an aristocratic worldview , this hierarchy of high and low was traded in for a more fluid , porous pecking order .
the early - '60s work of andy warhol , edward ruscha and roy lichtenstein is as brainy as the existential subjects of the abstract expressionist artists that preceded them ,
and it is also as dumb as the sunday funnies are .
that 's about as eclectic as a work of art can be .
one place the breadth and scope of the contemporary art scene is creating increasing pressures is in museums .
few were engaged with contemporary art 30 years ago ,
but many have waded in , desirous of the energy and public interest that come with the territory .
few , however , are equipped to handle the lively situation since it contradicts the orderly traditions of institutional structure .
nowhere has the problem been more keenly felt than in new york , center of not just the art market and art media but traditional museum culture .
contemporary programming at the guggenheim , the metropolitan , the modern and whitney can most charitably be described as a train wreck .
so , what 's going on with contemporary art these days ?
it 's a post-pop world , `` ism '' - free and with no end in sight .
pop culture used to be synonymous with mass culture ,
but in the era of 500 cable channels , ipods and the internet , broadcasting has faltered and been joined by vibrant narrowcasting .
contemporary art 's avid audience now approaches in size the ratings for hbo 's latest hit .
america 's political battles of the past 20 years may center on attempts to repeal or defend the dramatic changes wrought during the 1960s , but our robust artistic bounty today is its resplendent legacy .

last tango in paris
paris was once the sex capital of the world .
but a crackdown on prostitution and the rise of porn megastores are destroying a unique , secret heritage .
andrew hussey reports
every day of the week , from mid-morning until the early hours , the club 88 on rue saint - denis in central paris does a brisk trade .
from the outside at least , there is little to distinguish it from the dozen or so rival sex shops which line the streets in this part of paris , in between the stalls flogging cheap hip - hop gear and drugs paraphernalia .
this part of the city has always had a seedy reputation .
since the middle ages , it has been known as the haunt of hustlers , thieves and whores -
the street signs around here give the game away -lrb- la rue de la grande truanderie - `` the street of great criminality '' , named in the 15th century , is still home to evil - looking dope dealers -rrb- .
the upper end of rue saint - denis is lined day and night with prostitutes of all prices and races .
the lower end is less lively but nonetheless grim .
as recently as the 1970s , when the vast outdoor market of les halles was finally pulled down , it still enjoyed a reputation for gamey , sinful pleasures .
now that les halles has been replaced by a shopping mall , this part of the city is avoided by most native parisians and abandoned to tourists and banlieusards - the kids from the wretched council estates surrounding paris who come here by a fast , direct train to get wrecked and cause low - level trouble .
the bleak surroundings make it all the more remarkable that club 88 and its rival sex megastores have become the latest battlefield in parisian culture wars .
on the one side are young intellectuals of -lrb- usually -rrb- the radical left who embrace porn , even in its wildest forms , as part of their libertarian philosophy .
this explains , for example , how philippe azoury for the ultra-hip magazine les inrockuptibles , evoking the writer and erotomaniac georges bataille as his guide , can - without any shred of irony - describe club 88 as `` probably the best club in the world '' on the grounds that it offers both pleasure and excitement open to all .
a quick tour around club 88 reveals the truth of this statement .
although the exterior is discreet and vaguely stylish , inside , beyond the rows of standard specialist material -lrb- bestiality to coprophilia -rrb- , there is a labyrinth of cubicles , private rooms and viewing areas .
the central area is patrolled by girls , most of whom seem not to be french , but who cheerfully offer , in a variety of languages , a sex massage .
a tannoy reminds the idling would - be customer that `` l' amour sur scene '' takes place at regular intervals if enough tickets are sold .
on the upper floors , which are dimly - lit and apparently designed to be as disorientating as possible , it is possible to see over 400 different porn films an hour on the multi-screen channels .
there are dungeons and ante-chambers to god knows what .
business reaches a peak at lunch - times and in the early evening -
this is when you notice most of all the sociability and the buzz of the crowds -lrb- mostly male it has to be said but with a surprising number of couples , chatty lesbians and lone females -rrb- .
the sex megastore is now a staple feature in the famous red - light districts of paris -lrb- other big names here include scarlet and sexodrome in pigalle -rrb- .
however , despite the dvd viewing cabins , the lifts and escalators , the mumsy female staff and the credit - card friendly ambience which make them feel like a particularly kinky branch of waterstones , they are not universally popular .
the problem here , the argument runs , is that there is nothing specifically `` parisian '' about this environment .
more to the point , the rise of the sex megastore has gone hand - in - hand with nicolas sarkozy 's loudly stated mission to clean up the city .
this began in the summer of 2002 when sarkozy , then minister of the interior , introduced harsh fines on streetwalkers around rue saint - denis .
those he hit hardest were the independent working women , almost all of whom were native parisian - working class women , known as les traditionelles -lrb- the traditional ones -rrb- .
these girls were also known as parigotes -lrb- a parigot is the rough parisian equivalent of a cockney -rrb- and prized for their gouaille , a form of sarcastic wit .
the traditionelles of rue saint - denis found themselves driven out of the city centre by the harsh laws on street - walking .
many were reduced to working out of vans parked at porte dauphine or vincennes , hoping to pick up trade from passing motorists .
the newspaper le parisien reported angrily on the way on which these native parisians were being driven out to be replaced by girls from sub-saharan africa run by gangs from kosovo and romania .
le parisien did its best to explain that its complaints were not driven by racism but that traditionelles were as parisian as steak - frites , cheap red wine and gauloises cigarettes , and , when they left , the city had lost a vital component of its underground culture .
the likes of `` sandrine '' , who had worked rue saint - denis for nearly 20 years complained in the press that , not only was she being driven to penury , but that the city was losing part of its essential character .
she clearly hit a nerve ; the likes of club 88 , it was argued by those who took up the traditionnelles ' defence , could be anywhere in europe , from barcelona to hamburg .
at stake , it was further argued as the old generation of whores began to leave the city in droves , was the very soul of paris itself .
it is easy to see this as a typically gallic overstatement .
it is a fact , however , that the history of prostitution in paris is , for many , inextricably linked to the political fortunes of the city .
this tradition can be traced to 18th - century enlightenment ideology and the rise of a new class of thinkers , the libertins , who were avowedly atheist and sceptical about all other entrenched beliefs such as the power of monarchy .
during this period , the city swarmed with whores and to call for their suppression was to be in favour of church and king and other superstitions .
the growth of widespread prostitution in paris was paralleled by the rise of the new literary genre of pornography .
much early pornography was entirely functional , providing a guide to well - known brothels , such as le gros millan on rue du beaujolais or le grand balcon on rue de la croix des petits - champs .
the genre soon became an entertainment in its own right and a great deal of police energy was wasted on pursuing printers , publishers and readers of work that was deemed to be anti-christian and anti-social but which most parisians found as life - enhancing as any of their other pleasures .
popular titles such as the nun in her nightdress and john , the fucker debauched , were both bestsellers and intellectually respectable in the 18th - century city .
during the revolution of 1789 , the palais - royal , the great colonnaded space then at the heart of the city , played host to nightly sex shows .
one of the special amusements in the brothels on the upper floors was the availability of sosies de vedette , whores who looked like or dressed up as famous women of the day .
sexual activity only intensified during the height of the terror , when the girls wore red , white and blue bonnets and offered a special price to the top members of the assembly .
the real point was , of course , that liberty , equality and unbridled sexuality were all part of the indissoluble rights of man .
it is this tradition of mixing high political idealism and low carnal pleasures which informed the parisian sexual underground of the 1920s and 1930s , which was documented by the likes of the philosopher georges bataille and the photographer georges brassai .
bataille declared at the beginning of one of his most famous texts : `` whoever is afraid of whisky , naked girls and the obscene will never understand my philosophy '' .
the erotic life of the city during this period - when the likes of bataille and his friends and lovers -lrb- the poet colette peignot , who was his lover and intellectual muse was an eager participant in these adventures -rrb- could buy a whole orgy at one of the clubs on rue saint - denis - was beautifully photographed by brassai and enhanced paris 's reputation as a city of endless erotic powers .
this subterranean sexual city was effectively wiped out by 1946 , when the authorities , disgusted by the close relationships between brothel owners and the occupying german forces , shut down more than 180 of the notorious maison closes - the legal brothels scattered throughout the city , but especially clustered around rue saint - denis .
this was done on the orders of the politician marthe richard , who had herself been a prostitute and spy .
these establishments , including such famous names as le chabanais -lrb- which dated back to 1820 -rrb- , le sphinx , le one two two -lrb- this has survived into the 21st century as a swingers ' club -rrb- , were not only a part of parisian folklore but had stood as elaborate and rich monuments to all forms of human sexual activity .
somewhere such as le sphinx or le one two two not only offered the regular forms of coupling that could be bought all over the city , but specialised in `` shows '' and `` spectacles '' constructed to the whim of clients , who dined well in the attached restaurants as a prelude to more carnal pleasures .
the debates around the closure of the brothels are still , surprisingly , very much a live issue in paris .
one of the most powerful cases made in favour of them has been regularly made since the early 1990s by michele barzach , the conservative ex-minister for health , who argued for controlled brothels , both gay and straight , as a way of dealing with aids .
the enemies of this coalition are , however , surprisingly not all the puritans of the right or the `` new left '' -lrb- although segolene royal , the socialist party 's president - in - waiting does campaign on an anti-porn agenda -rrb- .
they are also often artists and writers , usually of an older generation .
more to the point , they too would describe themselves as keen on sexual transgression if not as downright erotomaniacs .
they include the likes of yves trentret , the academic and satirical novelist , who deplores the commercialised , `` industrial erotica '' of rue saint - denis .
`` i am of a generation that can just remember the erotic life of paris as it was , '' he says when we meet in a mainly algerian bar , l' aec en ciel , in the 13th arrondissement , which has a stock of mainly arab whores , `` but that way of life has gone for ever .
paris was once known throughout the world as the capital of sex , but even if foreigners come now , they do not find what they are looking for .
for me , it is worse still that the younger generation who celebrate hard - core porn do not seem to realise that they are celebrating hard - core values , and that these are the values of hard - core , globalised capitalism . ''
this is also an argument made by the film director and porn actress ovidie , who came to national prominence in france in 2002 with her book porno manifesto , a polemic in defence of porn .
ovidie 's big idea then was that everyday parisian life had been invaded by `` porno chic '' - the use of pornographic imagery in advertising - and that this was a betrayal of the intentions of those who , like her , both used prostitutes and made `` real porn '' .
i was then writing a book about paris which , among other things , set out to cover the underground sexuality of the city
and , inspired by her call for a return to older parisian traditions of sexual experience , i went to speak to ovidie for the first time on a chilly september morning in a cafe near rue saint - denis .
in those days , ovidie was tiny , pierced and dressed in black pyjamas like a junior maoist . she began by quoting the contemporary thinkers jean baudrillard , georges bataille and guy debord , who , all in different ways , made the case for sexual freedom , and cited the popularity of porn in pre-revolutionary paris , before explaining her notion that , because it is based on a universal need , in the right hands , `` porn can set you free '' .
ovidie went on :
pornography , she said , was about nothing more than the promise of human happiness .
the physical and economic exploitation that are undeniably involved in the sex industry , she said , are wrong only because they are a betrayal of this original , quite innocent trust .
the exploitation of women in particular , she said , was a betrayal of the original liberating aims of 18th - century pornography .
it was this egalitarian philosophy that ovidie claimed to recapture in her work .
this did not preclude payment : indeed quite the opposite .
`` i have sex for money , '' ovidie said ,
'' and , of course , that demands respect . ''
i met ovidie again a few weeks back in neuilly , the posh part of paris where she now lives - presumably having made a packet from her films with titles like orgie en noir and lilith .
it was three years since we had last met and she was now a mother .
she was also a little heftier around the edges but still with a definitive view on her own activities and the present state of sex in the city .
`` the problem is with paris itself , and probably france itself , '' she told me .
`` they are both changing for the worse .
parisians are unhappy
and that is expressed in their sexuality .
a place like rue saint - denis represents everything that has gone wrong -
it is not a place to go and have sex happily , as a person or as a couple .
it is now just gangsters and girls who are sex slaves from eastern europe and africa .
the myths of the orgies to be found there , that you read in georges bataille , may not have been entirely true
but they did correspond to some form of reality .
now it is practically impossible to have good sex with strangers in paris . ''
we talked of the vogue for echangisme -lrb- '' swinging '' -rrb- which was in vogue in paris in the late 1990s and - as famously documented in the memoirs of catherine millet and the novels of michel houellebecq - is far from being the naff and suburban activity that it is in great britain , was briefly the height of parisian chic .
`` i know of some echangistes clubs that are still charming and passionate , '' ovidie says , `` but really all that too has gone .
catherine millet is intelligent but her work is boring .
and michel houellebecq is not georges bataille -
he is really a moralist and his work does not celebrate sex like bataille but condemns it .
so why read houellebecq or millet ?
i think the problem is political .
french people despair of the future - which is unstable and dark - and they are too morose to have sex properly . ''
the conversation moves on to a discussion of rising violence in the suburbs , a disintegrating economy and the lack of a political solution .
but notwithstanding the prevailing gloomy moods in the city , individual parisians still take a chauvinistic pride in their horror of prudery .
they still lament on the pages of le parisien not only how the old - style whores are being driven from the city but how , over centuries , people 's pleasures have been policed by town - planning .
as the city was made more `` modern '' in the 19th century , for example , it was also governed by public prudery .
the first and clearest sign of this was the changing of street names in the brothel - ridden streets of saint - denis and les halles .
in 1809 , rue tire - boudin -lrb- '' sausage - puller street '' -rrb- became rue marie - stuart ;
rue trousse - nonain , or `` tumble - nun street '' , already disguised in official documents as tasse - nonian , became rue beaubourg ;
rue de la pute - y - muse , or `` idling tart street '' , became petit - muse , while the scatological collection of rues merdeuses , merdelet , chieurs and chiards all disappeared from haussmann 's new maps of the rational and hygienic city .
nowadays , one of the last bastions of a uniquely parisian approach to sex is le beverly , the only true porno cinema in the city centre , which , over the past few years , has been regularly preparing to close its doors for the last time .
this cinema stands at the top edge of the red - light district of rue saint - denis , almost but not quite in the rapidly gentrifying area of montorgueil st - denis .
over the door , there is a photograph of the poet rimbaud and his famous line `` il faut reinventer l 'amour '' -lrb- '' love must be reinvented '' -rrb- .
a poster in felt - tip pen offers special rates for couples on thursday nights .
most of the old - style porno cinemas in paris were swept away in the 1980s , victims of the booming video trade and the regular appearance of hard - core porn on mainstream television .
le beverly somehow struggled through the 1990s .
most of the customers who now come are visibly die - hards .
some of them looked too old to be even interested in sex .
perhaps they come for companionship and out of loyalty .
others look sinister and sheepish in equal measure .
a handful of third - world immigrants sit back in their seats , smoking .
le beverly has never been respectable - the atmosphere in the pitch - black salle de spectacle is tense and fervid , with more than a hint of real physical danger .
but to visit this place , in all its sleazy glory , is to take a trip to a bygone era : a time - maybe this was the 1960s or 1970s - when showing sex in a public space was a real transgression and possibly a real thrill .
these days , as a short stroll down rue saint - denis or through the back streets of pigalle - where porn dvds are on sale at knock - down rates - reveals the opposite is true .
i left the beverly intrigued but not quite convinced by ovidie 's argument that writing or screening sex is in itself a genuinely subversive statement of wilful and unrepentant erotic intent .
this may have been the case in the 18th century , or even in the 1970s ,
but , nowadays , i felt the vision of the writer michel houellebecq - who , in one of his poems , brilliantly describes , with appalled precision , the deadly routine of the hand - jobs and peep - shows available to fit in with the office hours of the central city - was indeed a more grimly accurate vision of 21st - century paris .
`` our civilisation suffers from vital exhaustion , '' houellebecq writes elsewhere , `` we need adventure and eroticism because we need to hear ourselves repeat that life is marvellous and exciting ;
and it 's abundantly clear that we rather doubt this . ''
paris is evidently no longer the capital of sex but it is mutating into something else ; an international sex theme park .
as i walked away from club 88 and then le beverly , it seemed to me that this theory explained the strangely drab and haunted faces on the whores i passed at the top end of rue saint - denis . -lrb- ' paris : the secret history ' , by andrew hussey is out now . -rrb-
michael jackson manchild in a promised land by robert j. lewis
he 's such an easy target , michael jackson .
he makes even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
but unlike them , jackson does n't try to hide the fact that he is easily one of the most screwed up beings on the planet .
every time he checks in for yet another surgery , he is announcing to the world that he does n't know who he is , where he is going , and that he thoroughly loathes himself - at least the adult version .
and for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confessions , he is subjected to one public humiliation after another .
who among us rock throwers would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what michael has revealed about himself ?
next to the towering monument that the unedited michael jackson is we are telephone booths ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we are the multitude of the prevaricating and pusillanimous .
everything michael has done and said during the past 20 years has been against his own apparent self - interest , beginning with unrelenting surgical assaults on his erstwhile good looks , to hanging his child -lrb- and crotch for that matter -rrb- out to dry , to entering details of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
like a typical dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it were n't for an apparently overriding need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world wants to believe -- the truth of who we are .
the on - going spectacle of michael 's increasingly bizarre conduct is his confession to the world that he is one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
like children who are incapable of dissimulating their basic wants and needs , michael 's manner of being in the world is uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent i propose he deserves to be considered one of the most authentic beings of this or any other century , and quite properly belongs to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include saint augustine , pascal and heidegger .
the facts of michael 's life have been well documented .
we know that by the age of 25 he was on top of the world .
thriller had sold an unprecedented 50 million copies and billie jean had become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
not only was the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly crafted and fused , michael 's riveting , counterpoint choreography - which remains unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
before disbelieving eyes , his torso , head and limbs supplied never - before - seen anatomical rejoinders to the notes -- like a guitarist filling in between the lyrics .
but from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for michael could no longer sustain the ' great lie ' he was living .
the child 's ' tin drum ' was beating ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understood that he was developmentally under - equipped to handle the adult pressures of stardom .
far more compelling than the promise of even greater fame and fortune was the example of oskar , from gunther grass ' the tin drum -lrb- 1959 -rrb- , which tells the story of a boy who refuses to grow up , who , through his drumming , rejects the adult world and the horrors taking place in nazi germany .
like oskar , michael had witnessed firsthand the abominations of adult behaviour and refused to sign up .
from his earliest years , michael jackson was subjected to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hands of his status - obsessed father , who designated michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambitions .
to this single end , joe jackson was ruthlessly single - minded .
michael was terrified of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
at the age of 5 , the father yanked the son from his pail and sandbox existence and made him run hollywood 's grimmest gauntlets .
the little mouse that michael was suddenly found himself in the rat race and quickly learned to hate it ,
and like oskar , who found respite in the beating of his tin drum , michael found solace on stage , performing his music .
but the stage could not provide michael with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
listen to his rapid breathing in especially off the wall and thriller : the staccato - like panting of a stalked animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hiding behind the mesmerizing slash and blur of arms and legs fending off an invisible attack .
from one track to the next , the lyrics are n't so much sung as frantically whispered , the vowels cut short to the quick .
michael was announcing that he could no longer follow the course father and hollywood had staked out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he was thrust into had reached unsustainable incommensurability .
only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredations of the adult world ,
and from this point on , michael would reduce the project of his life to letting the world know the truth of who he was : a confused , fragile , lost soul in search of care and love .
by the time michael had attained mythic status , he was so far removed and alienated from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of 20 years and still counting , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
as we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis .
michael 's journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
more revealing of itself than its favorite target , public opinion has not seen fit to grant michael the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
if most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when michael , who was introduced to the white ways of hollywood at the age of 5 , tells us that he is n't sure what his true color is ?
robbed of his childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that michael does n't want to grow up , that he prefers the company and community of children , that he wants to be protected and looked after ?
every time the androgynous jackson goes under the knife he is crying out that he does n't know if he is man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
as if we would have done otherwise in his situation ?
and to the never - ending suspicion that michael is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
if you believe that michael has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , -lrb- and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years -rrb- he should not have had to defend himself against accusations of child molestation .
was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convinced him that it was ok to reveal that he shared his bed with children ?
more questionable , even criminal , than michael 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991 .
on june 13 , 2005 , the courts found michael not guilty of the charges brought against him .
however , those whose minds were decided on his guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as michael 's essential nature will not have changed .
mahatma gandhi writes that ' there is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience . '
only michael knows if he is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if he has ever acted on those feelings .
and if we grant him the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , michael is then a child trapped in an adult body .
which means the crowning act in his quest for authenticity awaits one final operation .
what does a man do when he feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ?
he undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' is .
there remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that michael is .
when michael finds the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the saving grace and glory that is his neverland will become his forever land .
tennessee williams has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
and i say this to you , michael jackson , may your tribe increase .
`` thank god i 'm an atheist : ''
the surrealistic cinema of luis bunuel --
by bryan m. papciak
`` the thought of death has been familiar to me for a long time , '' says director luis bunuel .
`` from the time that skeletons were carried through the streets of calanda during the holy week procession , death has been an integral part of my life .
i 've never wished to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' -lrb- 255 -rrb- .
so reads an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
like many of his contemporary surrealists , bunuel is a paradox who on one hand claims apathy towards ultimate end , being , and being , yet on the other hand loads his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange ideas about the god he so vociferously denies .
bunuel exhibits a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he finds society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
he has been called a realist , a surrealist , a marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a freudian , a post-freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a christian , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
his scenarios range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endued with the outrageous and the scandalous .
luis bunuel has long been recognized in european critical circles as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with eisenstein , chaplin , and fellini .
however , only recently has his reputation in america begun to catch up .
over his fifty - year career he directed thirty - two feature films and worked in spain , france , mexico , italy , and the united states .
utilizing sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , bunuel set out to undermine the values and institutions people take for granted .
his aims were specific : through the surreal , visualizing the impulses of the uncon - scious , he would , he said , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader -lrb- or spectator -rrb- to question the permanency of the prevailing order '' -lrb- mellen 3 -rrb- .
luis bunuel was born february 22 , 1900 in calanda , a small town in the province of teruel , spain .
as a youth he received a jesuit education , displaying exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural sciences .
he enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
his family came from liberal , semi-intellectual , land - owning bourgeoisie .
these details are not irrelevant .
to comprehend bunuel 's works it is essential to understand that he was first a spaniard and secondly a product of spanish bourgeoisie .
virginia higgenbotham points out that `` blasphemy is only a form of thinking for any intelligent spaniard , '' and also that the `` art of his country is rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupied with death '' -lrb- 18 , 20 -rrb- .
bunuel says : my infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere -lrb- like that of nearly all the spanish provinces -rrb- between my native town and zaragova .
i feel it necessary to say here -lrb- since it explains in part the trend of the modest work which i later accomplished -rrb- that the two basic sentiments of my childhood which stayed with me well into adolescence , are those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimated in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
it would take too long here to analyze the reasons .
it suffices that i was not an exception among my compatriots , since this is a very spanish characteristic , and our art , exponent of the spanish spirit , was impregnated with these two sentiments .
the last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other exposed them clearly .
coming of age , bunuel expressed a strong urge to go to paris to study music but was sent instead to madrid to study agricultural engineering .
after a few years , he switched his studies to entomology , and , more importantly , began forming close friendships with a group of young artists who were to influence him strongly in the future .
these companions included the poets frederico garcia lorca and jose moreno villa and the painter salvador dali .
in the madrid residencia bunuel developed his interest in the arts , theater , and acting and gained his introduction to surrealism .
after graduating in 1925 with a degree in philosophy and letters , bunuel moved to paris , joined by a few members of his residencia coterie .
bunuel arrived in paris highly recommended by influential friends of his parents and was introduced into the best intellectual circles of the city .
he was soon hired as an assistant director to jean epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the french cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' -lrb- aranda 32 -rrb- .
while honing his skills working as an a.d. , bunuel also began contributing articles to various literary cinema periodicals , most notably la gaceta hispanoamericana .
in 1929 he formally entered the paris surrealist group .
within this setting he embarked on his first film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend salvador dali , entitled un chien andalou .
he collaborated with dali again in 1930 on another surrealist film , l_age d' or .
the rest , as they say , is history .
some critics , most notably pauline kael and penelope gilliatt , now regard bunuel as the hitchcock of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation became a `` delightful form of play . ''
for bunuel , however , play had little to do with it .
rather , he saw surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
all of us were supporters of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealists did n't consider themselves terrorists , they were constantly fighting a society they despised .
the principle weapon was not guns , of course , it was scandal .
scandal was a potent agent of revelation , capable of exposing such social crimes as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that had to be destroyed .
he went on to say , `` the purpose of surrealism was not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' -lrb- 107 -rrb- .
salvador dali recalled the surrealists ' ideology , `` it is possible to systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality '' -lrb- gould 37 -rrb- .
indeed , the intent of surreal art is to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
it seeks to affect the emotions through the mind .
michael gould states in surrealism and the cinema , `` if the vision revealed is too much for the rational mind to absorb -lrb- too intense , too threatening , too ' real ' -rrb- yet can not be rejected , then it leaves the consciousness and comes to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' -lrb- 13 -rrb- .
in un chien andalou , for example , a girl 's eye is sliced with a razor blade ,
a man wipes his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcasses adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawls with ants .
each of these images is clearly too intense for rational thought .
bunuel was drawn to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reasons .
the moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well :
for the first time in my life , i 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as i could tell , had no flaws .
it was an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all existing values .
we had other criteria :
we exalted passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
inside this new territory , all our thoughts and actions seemed justifiable ;
there was simply no room for doubt .
everything made sense .
our morality may have been more demanding and more dangerous than the prevailing order , but it was also stronger , richer , more coherent .
the surreal qualities in bunuel 's films can be traced to a number of sources ,
but the primary impetus was his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidenced by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
these gave his films their dreamlike quality .
his most intense images are evocative of either humor or mystery .
mystery , he believed , is the essential element of any art ;
it is inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe is a mystery , bunuel believed that his own form of atheism led inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
`` since i reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he said , `` -lrb- a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explains -rrb- , then i must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
at least it keeps my moral freedom intact '' -lrb- 174 -rrb- .
predictably , adherence to fantasy as opposed to reason in a rationalistic society leads to conflict .
the surrealists opposed nearly all traditional values and , as noted before , sought to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habits of thought and perception '' -lrb- higgenbotham 30 -rrb- .
enter un chien andalou .
in 1929 , un chien andalou was as shocking and scandalous as bunuel and dali had hoped it would be .
it gave rise to a staggering range of interpretations : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critics , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
-lrb- interestingly , the film was financed by bunuel 's bourgeois mother . -rrb-
un chien andalou -lrb- which means an andalusian dog -- though there are no dogs in the film -rrb- was deliberately intended to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic beliefs underlying the surrealist movement , including the omnipotence of desire .
bunuel stated that he and dali held to only one rule during the production ,
`` no idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accepted .
we had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us without trying to explain why '' -lrb- 104 -rrb- .
the aim of the film was not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
at the same time it was an indictment of all the art consumers who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , were willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it went against their instincts .
bunuel asked , `` what can i do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that saw beauty and poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' -lrb- bauche 9 -rrb- .
the film is a dream and , like a dream , is both fascinating and disturbing .
the opening scene in which a girl 's eye is sliced sets the tone of the film 's meandering and confusing itinerary .
many of the elements that make up the film are remnants of objective reality .
the way they are arranged within the scenario pushes them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dreams draw on the previous day 's experience .
interestingly , the images have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what higgenbotham calls a `` prosaic realism '' -lrb- 38 -rrb- .
bunuel chose not to use the distorted lenses , supered images , or blurred focus -lrb- cinematic conventions of the day -rrb- to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
instead , he approached the entire non-narrative in a straightforward manner .
he used the shocking incongruity of the images themselves to build the hallucinatory feeling of anguish that runs through the film .
the unrealistic fashion in which the realistic images were juxtaposed was the perfect way , according to freddy bauche , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' -lrb- 10 -rrb- .
obviously , the director drew much of un chien andalou from his spanish heritage -- the religious and social implications , the themes of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcasses .
`` thus un chien andalou , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerges from its director 's adolescence in spain and announces the themes and techniques that were to preoccupy bunuel for half a century , through the rest of his career '' -lrb- higgenbotham 39 -rrb- .
where desire and eroticism prevailed in un chien andalou , religion took center stage in simon del desierto -lrb- simon of the desert -rrb- , produced in mexico in 1965 .
simon del desierto is a bizarre little narrative set in the fifth century a.d.
saint simon , in order to be as close to god as possible , has stood praying on top of a sixty - foot pillar for thirty - seven years .
he is profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even blesses his own tooth when it falls from his mouth .
his devotion , however , is put to the test when the devil -lrb- a woman wearing the uniform of a catholic school girl -rrb- arrives in a slithering coffin at the pillar .
she is intent on luring the holy disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicules him and insults his character .
simon heroically resists her temptations at every turn despite her various disguises ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the savior himself .
at last , despite simon 's holy strength , and for reasons not entirely clear , the devil is able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a greenwich village disco where trendies writhe and grind to `` the radioactive flesh . ''
the implications are staggering .
`` the saint , devoted to his god , sits high on a pillar for all of life ....
but the pillar , discolored over the years , winding and twisting its way to the ground , is the excrement of the saint .
saint though he is , his bowels must still move .
so there he sits , near god indeed , but supported on a pillar of excrement '' -lrb- mellen 115 -rrb- .
there have been several interpretations of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
one is that god and his church are really built on unacknowledged humanity .
another is that we can reach god only through understanding the true nature of our humanity .
still another is that religion -lrb- primarily catholicism -rrb- is essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
bunuel himself put all the interpretations in perspective when he said , `` thank god i 'm still an atheist . ''
luis bunuel 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attacks on conventional morality were fully realized in his second to last film , le fantome de la liberte -lrb- the phantom of liberty -rrb- , produced in france in 1974 -- almost fifty years after un chien andalou .
fantome in many ways functioned as a sort of sequel to his 1972 film , le channe discret de la bourgeoisie -lrb- the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie -rrb- .
the images are astounding and playfully absurd :
spanish hostages of the napoleonic war cry `` down with freedom ! '' as they are executed .
a french lieutenant fondles the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and is struck on the head by another statue .
bourgeois couples discuss defecation around a toilet - lined table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
the titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the opening line of karl marx 's communist manifesto :
`` a specter is haunting europe - the specter of communism . ''
bunuel twists this meaning to imply that the specter haunting the bourgeoisie is `` the possibility of its own freedom unburdened by the dead ends of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricities of the individual ego '' -lrb- mellen 318 -rrb- .
bunuel compared the film to one of his earlier surrealist works , l_age d' or , saying , `` it is no longer possible to scandal-ize people as we did in 1930 .
today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' -lrb- mellen 183 -rrb- .
le fantome de la liberte charges that society has substituted arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
one of the film 's vignettes shows two parents who insist on declaring their daughter a missing person , although she is plainly sitting in front of them .
the police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistics and how she disappeared .
in another episode , four chain - smoking monks gamble with their holy medallions in a card game .
`` i 'll open with a virgin , '' says one .
another plays a `` father . ''
bunuel believed reality is actually a smoke screen for hidden urges .
he used the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuses , not on some safely vague condition of man '' -lrb- durgnat 65 -rrb- .
in le fantome de la liberte bunuel doubts not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
`` we have been rendered unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cages to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' -lrb- mellen 331 -rrb- .
for fifty years , luis bunuel made films about society 's dilemmas .
his art is his declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
he summed it all up himself :
as i drift toward my last sigh , i often imagine a final joke .
i convoke around my deathbed my friends who are confirmed atheists as i am .
then a priest , whom i have summoned , arrives ;
and to the horror of my friends , i make my confession , ask for absolution for my sins , and receive extreme unction .
after which i turn over on my side and expire .
but will i have the strength to joke at that moment ?
luis bunuel died in 1983 .
note : there 's a piece by george packer in the new yorker -lrb- '' betrayed : the iraqis who trusted america the most '' -rrb- about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
check it out if you want .
it 's hair - raising stuff .
christ , can no one trust an american anymore ?
i 'm gettting sick and tired of being ashamed of the usa .
what have we come to ?
fuck , piss , shit .
anyway , here 's a shorter piece from mother jones :
thrown to the assassins
they cheered the u.s. invasion ;
they offered to help , signed on as translators , risked everything they had to work for the united states .
but when they had to run for their lives , america slammed the door .
by david case / mother jones
on the day the american tanks rolled into baghdad , abather abdul hussein and his wife , balqes abdel mohammed , threw flowers .
literally .
after a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believed the invasion would bring peace .
abather joined u.s. `` democratization '' efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news iraq stories that still seemed plausible in those days ;
one u.s. paper ran a five - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by american soldiers , with a story about the `` new iraq . ''
these days , abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of iraqis who have fled in fear for their lives .
after months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the americans , he and balqes are relieved to have escaped -- and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
a short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert 's winter chill , the 34 - year - old abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
an engaging conversationalist even in broken english , he loves to talk about baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
`` when we met she was a professor at baghdad university , '' he boasts .
`` i was her student .
when she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . ''
considering that his life savings will run out in two months , that he ca n't work legally in jordan , and that he could be deported at any moment , abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
he chain - smokes cheap craven a cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ;
when balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that `` smoking is my only work . ''
it 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past 18 months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
in december , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
the story began after the ouster of saddam , when abather and balqes , like many iraqis , launched a de-baathification program of their own .
their target was the dean who had been balqes ' boss at baghdad university -lrb- and who , as abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the baath party -rrb- .
balqes wanted her job back ;
one day abather confronted the dean ,
and tempers flared .
american soldiers broke up the brawl , bound abather 's wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
he explained balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their 3 - year - old son and balqes ' 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage -lrb- her first husband had been killed in the iran - iraq war -rrb- .
though he held a master 's degree in engineering , abather had n't been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era iraq ,
so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father 's small home .
`` the soldiers were very understanding , '' abather recalls .
`` i was impressed . ''
they offered the family an apartment in a place called iraqi village , a compound near the baghdad airport where saddam had housed orphans he was grooming to become fedayeen loyalists .
in return , the couple translated for the americans , and eventually the washington national guard 's 1st battalion 303rd armored regiment hired balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
abather ended up leading a u.s. army - contracted security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
he started an engineering firm and worked with contractors such as abb and kellogg , brown and root ; in one heady year , abather 's contracts would mushroom from a few thousand dollars to an $ 862,000 electrification project -lrb- later canceled because he could n't procure the needed equipment -rrb- .
abather and balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the first time .
most of all , abather enjoyed hanging out with the americans .
he seems to remember every soldier he ever met :
captain philips and sergeant buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
lieutenant glenn allen got so close to the family they called him `` uncle allen . ''
-lrb- allen confirmed abather 's story in emails to me , calling him and balqes `` very helpful individuals '' who `` risked their lives by meeting with us . '' -rrb-
it was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the 51st state .
and so , in october 2004 , when abather got his first death threat , he thought it was a joke .
it was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside iraqi village , a gated community with american checkpoints at both its entrances ;
the note read :
abather , leave your work with the americans .
otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
jihad army
then the killings began .
lieutenant allen had once given abather a photo depicting two american soldiers with five of their iraqi friends .
three of the iraqis were assassinated in short order . abather began to notice cars following him ,
and a few times shots were fired at his car .
the anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
eventually , iraqi village felt so dangerous that abather and balqes moved the family back to his father 's house .
a death threat arrived there almost immediately .
still abather continued working with the americans .
one day in august 2005 , abather was driving balqes , six months pregnant with their second child , to a doctor 's appointment .
at an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ;
suddenly the two men in it leveled guns at him .
`` this is the end , '' abather thought ,
and then a u.s. patrol appeared
and the assailants vanished into traffic .
within days , abather and balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to amman .
their troubles had only just begun .
the u.s. embassy in amman is an attractive , arabian - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in ford pickups .
it sits high on a hillside ,
and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the iraqi border , some 200 miles away .
in the foreground , amman 's rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
at its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of baghdad 's educated middle class .
almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ;
many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the americans . of iraq 's 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have left their homes since the invasion , according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- ,
and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
refugees international labels this the world 's fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
yet the bush administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
in the past , notes bill frelick , refugee policy director at human rights watch , the united states has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ;
since the vietnam war , 1 million vietnamese refugees have been resettled in the united states , including tens of thousands of south vietnamese army veterans .
but the bush administration `` has abdicated that obligation , '' says frelick .
`` the people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in iraq ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . ''
it was in jordan that abather and balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the united states .
lieutenant `` uncle '' allen had emailed the embassy in amman to explain that the family feared for their lives ;
he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the united states . ''
an unsigned email from the embassy commended allen -- '' i know that your iraqi friends appreciate your friendship '' -- but noted that u.s. visas are `` quite difficult '' for iraqis to get .
since 9 / 11 , middle easterners in general , and iraqis in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the united states ;
until 2005 , the bush administration maintained a total freeze on iraqis that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled saddam hussein 's regime years earlier .
the email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa , and abather and balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ 200 fee -- almost two months ' rent .
several months later they were notified that they could visit the united states for up to three months , but that they could not bring their children .
they then made repeated visits to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
as it has with almost 99 percent of the iraqis who have come through its office in amman , the agency turned them down .
abather and balqes set their sights on a visa to australia , a major destination for iraqi refugees , and even hired an iraqi lawyer there .
they waited for months .
their savings dwindled ;
then their baby fell ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
in early june 2006 , abather got a rejection letter from australia .
around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
so he went back to iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
but when he returned to the jordanian border less than a week later , he was told he could n't reenter the country :
having recently suffered two terrorist attacks , jordan had enacted a ban on entry for iraqi men aged 17 to 35 .
for two days abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in amman if he would just go away .
once again abather headed back to baghdad .
driving in baghdad a few days later , he noticed a bmw -- the iraqi gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in . the car forced him off the road ;
armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
when he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
they whipped him with a steel cable ;
six months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
`` we 've been searching for you for a year , '' his captors told him .
abather recognized the voice of one man , an acquaintance from iraqi village who had seemed to befriend the americans .
`` i 'm sorry your father passed away , '' the man said .
soon , a bearded imam sentenced abather to decapitation for collaborating with the united states .
abather barely heard the proceedings .
`` i was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in amman . ''
he was told he could save himself by spying on the americans , but he refused .
on the eighth day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ; then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and sped off .
suddenly , abather heard gunshots .
the men shouted . the car crashed ,
and everything went black .
he woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from baghdad ; iraqi forces had attacked the bmw and pulled him from the burning wreck .
he had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body ,
but the nurses urged him to leave :
his captors would be looking for him .
his brother -- who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of abather bound and gagged -- brought him back to baghdad , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
a few weeks later , he was back at the jordanian border ,
and this time the guards took pity .
the family had n't told balqes of the kidnapping .
but when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , `` i knew right away what happened . ''
on a crisp , clear day this past december , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting abather and balqes ' ordeal -- contracts , soldiers ' recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report -- i headed to american citizen services at the u.s. embassy in amman .
abather and balqes had made several pilgrimages there ;
they were convinced that if only they could speak to an american , abather 's charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the jordanian security guards .
outside the embassy , i joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of americans : a retired hippie turned english teacher from vermont ; a woman with a new york accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a santa hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the north pole .
i wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the united states as abather and balqes had .
to get past the compound 's first wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an x-ray machine ;
after crossing a 30 - foot no man 's land we repeated the process at the second wall .
then we waited to be called . the united states admits more refugees than any country in the world ,
but in 2006 , only 202 iraqis were allowed in , and most of them had fled persecution under saddam before the war .
this year , millions of iraqis , tibetans , sri lankans , and afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slots congress has allocated for the middle east and south asia .
the iraqis are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in jordan since the late 1990s .
like other western representatives , u.s. officials here refer displaced people to the unhcr , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
except that , as amman unhcr head robert breen told me , a 1998 agreement with jordan forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it ca n't get out of the country within six months -- an impossibility in the post / 11 world .
-lrb- a country of about 6 million , jordan has long had the world 's highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million palestinians who fled israel in 1948 and were supposed to stay only a short time . -rrb-
of the 21,000 iraqi asylum seekers the office has registered since the u.s. invasion , only 291 have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr 's gates gets longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stands at five months .
to care for all of the region 's displaced iraqis , the agency had a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 -- less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
recognizing the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffering , '' the iraq study group in december recommended that `` the united states take the lead '' in funding the unhcr 's iraq program ;
currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
direct u.s. aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the catholic relief organization caritas -lrb- see `` how to help , '' page 68 -rrb- .
at the embassy , i recounted abather and balqes ' ordeal at window 3 , then at window 1 -- the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
then , at window 4 , i told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
i was expecting to hear that `` the united states is doing its best to help , ''
but there was only silence as the consul 's eyes welled up .
-lrb- an amman - based aid worker later told me that american diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that `` it just takes a few gin and tonics and they 'll break down . '' -rrb-
finally , the consul said , `` we hear stories like this all the time .
we have enormous empathy for the iraqis who 've suffered after working with the americans ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
she handed me a document outlining congress ' sole concession to people like abather and balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from iraq or afghanistan each year .
`` but do n't get their hopes up , '' she added quickly ;
there were thousands with the same story .
`` this is something congress really needs to address , '' she said as we parted .
the administration certainly does n't seem inclined to take the initiative .
philip a. frayne , an embassy spokesman in amman , told me that `` there are no reliable figures '' on how many people have fled iraq , and that in any case , it was saddam who drove out `` a large percentage '' of them .
likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to congress , the state department focused mainly on those saddam - era exiles , and blithely intoned , `` it is hoped that significant numbers of iraqi refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
the report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit u.s. committee for refugees , 644,500 new refugees entered jordan and syria in 2005 alone .
and 2006 will likely be worse .
as much as a quarter of greater amman 's population is now iraqi ,
and the crowds have exacerbated the city 's severe water shortage .
prices have skyrocketed .
until recently iraqi children could n't attend jordanian schools ,
and their parents can not legally work ;
easily identified by their dialect , iraqis are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
some refugees never go outside .
jordanian government spokesman nasser s. judeh told me that his country , a staunch u.s. ally and aid recipient , `` certainly needs help , and has held discussions with u.s. diplomats '' about this issue .
incidentally , human rights watch has also called upon the gulf arab states to pitch in ;
saudi arabia 's response so far has been to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with iraq .
before i left jordan , abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from baghdad who shares their two - room basement apartment .
on the al zawraa tv channel from baghdad , we watched u.s. army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , `` let 's go kill the americans ! '' the channel 's endless stream of anti-american propaganda perplexed abather and his friends :
`` why does the united states allow this ? '' they inquired .
when images of dead children supposedly killed by the americans hit the screen , abather 's friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous arab women danced in an un-islamic way . balqes served iraqi coffee ,
and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
she giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
this is her prison , he joked .
six months after the kidnapping , he still had n't gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ;
if the wounds become infected , he could die .
abather rarely complained .
god is testing us , he said .
but we will get through it .
he looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled . i have a daughter ,
and i 'm very happy .
balqes was more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
iraq , she worried , had already caught up with them .
how to help
very few organizations are working on getting aid to iraqi refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ;
the iraqi red crescent , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside iraq .
one of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the catholic group caritas , whose caseworkers i shadowed while in amman .
bucking the image of the land rover - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray honda , its roof eaten through by rust .
they visited iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ; one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
caritas helps a few thousand families a year ,
but the demand far outstrips the money available to us , says magy mahrous , who oversees the project .

here 's a classic rumsfeldism -lsb- 1 -rsb- :
`` we do have a saying in america :
if you 're in a hole , stop digging ...
erm , i 'm not sure i should have said that . ''
in part 2 of his historical excavation of the life and world of donald rumsfeld -lrb- not to speak of the worlds of both president bushes , the neocons , the u.s. military , the gop , and an indolent media -rrb- , roger morris , already deep in that hole , just keeps digging away .
in doing so , he offers us the rest of rumsfeld 's long march to power , his lasting legacies , and the costly lessons of this comeback kid .
so much that went unheeded in the years in which rumsfeld once again scaled the heights of power is now , thanks to morris , compactly on the record .
`` the absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence '' is another infamous rumsfeldism .
how true .
and in rumsfeld 's absence , the evidence of how he changed our world for the worse will be with us to consider for years to come .
so , if you missed it , check out `` sharp elbows , '' -lsb- 2 -rsb- the first part of `` the undertaker 's tally , '' and then settle in for the sequel , the one you thought you knew until you read `` the power and the glory . ''

the power and the glory : the undertaker 's tally -lrb- part 2 -rrb-
by roger morris
in 1976 , when jimmy carter took the presidency from gerald ford , outgoing defense secretary donald rumsfeld went off to seek corporate wealth as head of g.d. searle , a skokie pharmaceutical company .
his period running the business , inherited by the family of his north shore friend and early backer dan searle , would become part of rumsfeld 's legend of success as a master manager , negligently accepted as fact by the media and congressional representatives at his 2001 confirmation hearings .
the legend went this way :
political prodigy slashes payroll 60 % , turns decrepit loser into mega-profit - maker , earns industry kudos and multiple millions .
in looking at men of prominence like rumsfeld who revolve in and out of the private sector , the washington media almost invariably adopts the press - release or booster business - page version of events from what inside - the - beltway types call `` the real world . ''
in rumsfeld 's case , behind the image of corporate savior lay a far more relevant and ominous history .
in the documented version of reality , derived from litigation and relatively obscure investigations in the u.s. and abroad , searle turned out to enjoy its notable rise less thanks to rumsfeldian innovative managerial genius than to old - fashioned reckless marketing of pharmaceuticals already on the shelf and the calling in of lobbying `` markers '' via its well - connected republican ceo .
and over it all wafted the distinctive odor of corrupt practices .
a case in point was searle 's anti-diarrhea medicine lomotil , sold ever more widely and profitably internationally -lrb- in industry terms `` dumped '' -rrb- -- especially in africa in the late 1970s -- despite the company 's failure to warn of its potentially dire effects on younger children .
`` a blindly harmful stopcock , '' one medical journal called the remedy , which could be poisonous to infants only slightly above searle 's recommended dosage .
even taken according to directions , lomotil was known to mask dangerous dehydration and cause a lethal build - up of fluids internally .
having advertised the medicine as `` ideal for every situation , '' searle did not undertake a cautionary labeling change until the end of 1981 , nearly five years into rumsfeld 's tenure , and then only when threatened with damaging publicity by children 's advocacy groups .
part of the vast outrage of multinational `` pharmas '' exploiting the third world , the company under rumsfeld would , like the more publicized upjohn with its depo - provera , be implicated in widespread bribery of officials -lrb- and others -rrb- in poorer countries to promote the sale of oral contraceptives which had been found unsafe for american or european women .
but searle 's magic potion , concocted well before rumsfeld 's arrival , was to be the controversial artificial sweetener aspertame , marketed under the trade name nutrasweet .
by 1977 , the food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- had staunchly refused to approve aspertame for some 16 years , finding test data dubious or inconclusive and fearing that potential long - term dangers might prove prohibitive .
as rumsfeld took over in skokie , the fda was taking the rare step of recommending to justice department prosecutors that a grand jury investigate the company 's applications for fda approval for `` willful and knowing failure to make reports . concealing material facts and making false statements '' in connection with the statutory application process required by law and fda standards .
over the next four years , federal regulators held firm against searle 's heavily financed campaigns .
only with reagan 's election in 1980 did fix and favor supplant science and the public interest .
having campaigned for the new president and been named to his transition team , rumsfeld told his searle sales force , according to later testimony , that `` he would call in all his markers and that no matter what , he would see to it that aspartame would be approved . ''
the sequel would be a classic of the genre :
searle 's reapplication to the fda the day reagan was inaugurated ; the prompt appointment of an agreeable fda commissioner who would later go to work for searle 's public relations firm for $ 1,000 a day ; further questionable , company - commissioned tests with more doubts by fda scientists but approval of aspertame nonetheless ; a later plague of health problems but by then vast profits throughout the corporate food economy followed by lavish , multi-company contributions to congressional committee members to stifle any outcry ; eventually , a $ 350 million class - action suit alleging racketeering , fraud , and multiple abuses centering on rumsfeld , who meanwhile had become gloriously rich from aspertame and the $ 2.7 - billion sale of searle to monsanto in 1985 .
in his return to the pentagon in 2001 , he would go duly unscathed by any of the company 's history .
by the time litigation would be filed , the united states was already 18 months into the occupation of iraq .
envoy
as it was , despite his business conquests , rumsfeld missed an even greater prize .
he had been on a short list to become ronald reagan 's running mate in the 1980 presidential campaign when the candidate unexpectedly reached for his defeated primary rival -lrb- and rumsfeld nemesis -rrb- george h.w. bush .
while , over the next 12 years , bush went on to the vice - presidency and presidency , and jim baker -- equally detested by rumsfeld -- went along with his patron to white house staff and cabinet power , rumsfeld would build his searle fortune and bide his time .
the one exception to his involuntary reagan - era exile from government would be a stint in 1983 as special presidential envoy to the middle east .
he would be sent to arrange u.s. support for saddam hussein 's iraq in its war with the hated iranians of ayatollah khomeini , a role little noticed at the time which nonetheless produced the notorious photo of rumsfeld shaking hands with the iraqi dictator .
the deeper story was far more embarrassing than any simple handshake .
most of the relevant records on rumsfeld 's several - month assignment are still classified , though it is clear that , as at the office of equal opportunity -lrb- oeo -rrb- , he took on his mission with a passion .
he worked to shower on saddam -lrb- in a manner as unnoticed as possible -rrb- an infamous flow of intelligence , financial credits , and sensitive materials and technology that would come to underpin iraqi chemical and bacteriological warfare programs , leading to hideous gas attacks on shia dissidents and kurds as well as the iranian forces .
in general , rumsfeld put his shoulder to the wheel to shore up the war - worn baathist regime that had attacked iran in 1980 .
in this mid-1980s de facto alliance with saddam , as in much else , rumsfeld was never alone .
their gambit was , in turn , backed by senators and congressmen in both parties who were briefed on rumsfeld 's mission and obligingly shunned oversight of the manifold aspects of the sometimes illegal collusion with the iraqis .
their dereliction was assured , in part , by the general animus toward iran on a capitol hill then effectively controlled by the republicans , and increasingly under the bipartisan influence of the growing israeli lobby and its tel aviv handlers .
the lobby quietly , cynically pushed both for reagan administration aid to iraq and for covert arms - dealing with iran -lrb- later exposed in the iran - contra scandal -rrb- , viewing the ongoing no - winners carnage of two islamic states as a boon .
all this went on largely unreported , given the customary media diffidence or indolence on national security issues .
historically , the moral outrage and far - reaching political folly of washington 's furtive arming of one tyranny to bleed another , with untold casualties on each side -lrb- including the murderous suppression of would - be democrats in both countries -rrb- , would belong at the doorstep of reagan 's reactionary regime and the washington foreign - policy establishment as a whole .
rumsfeld 's role was instrumental and in some respects crucial , but only part of the larger disgrace .
at the same time , in the intelligence briefings he received as the first ranking u.s. official to go to iraq since the baghdad pact of the 1950s , he would have been uniquely aware , as no other senior figure in washington , of the brutal character of saddam hussein 's regime and , in particular , the sectarian , regional , tribal , and clan politics that lay behind it .
the ba'athists were a government , after all , that the cia itself had helped to recruit and install in the coup of 1963 , reinstalled in 1968 when the agency 's original clients lost control , and then watched closely while baghdad had a flirtation -lrb- involving an arms - supply relationship -rrb- with the feared russians -lrb- whose influence the bloody 1963 coup was supposed to counter -rrb- .
this was particularly true in the aftermath of the arab - israeli war of 1973 with its peace agreements from which iraq emerged as a principal remaining challenge to israel .
by 1983 , the volatile , complex currents of iraq 's political culture , saddam 's essentially family and clan rule , and the now crude , now subtle layering of sunni and shia in the ba'athist bureaucracy and plutocracy , as well as the wartime distrust and savage repression of a suspect , subordinate shia majority , were well known to outside intelligence agencies as well as scholars and journalists .
the cia , dia and state department bureaus of near eastern affairs and intelligence and research -- and certainly rumsfeld as presidential envoy -- also had reason to understand much about saddam 's grandiose ambition , in iraq 's old rivalry with egypt , to lead a pan-arab nationalist renaissance to some kind of future parity with israel 's nuclear - armed military might .
in addition to the usual extensive intelligence - sharing with israel 's mossad , less than two years before rumsfeld 's iraq mission cia operatives had literally lit the way for israeli f fighter bombers in their june 1981 surprise attack on saddam 's fledgling nuclear reactor at osiraq .
they planted guidance transmitters along the low - level flight path under jordanian and iraqi radar to the point of painting the target with lasers .
the agency and mossad then watched as the iraqis dauntlessly , defiantly began to rebuild and expand their nuclear program .
from some 400 scientists and technicians with $ 400 million in funding , that program would grow to perhaps 7,000 scientists and technicians with as much as $ 10 billion at their command , some of which was indirectly made possible by the bounty rumsfeld carried to baghdad in the mid-1980s
for anyone dealing seriously with these issues , there could have been little doubt that saddam would use the considerable aid and trade rumsfeld was sliding his way under the table to mount a better - armed , more bloody war on iran , to further the regime 's most ambitious dreams of weapons development , and to tyrannize all the more savagely potentially rebellious iraqi shiites and kurds .
as washington watched , he did all of that --
and no one could have been less surprised than rumsfeld himself .
long afterward , as some of the ugly essence of his mission to baghdad dribbled out amid the ruins of bush 's iraqi occupation , rumsfeld would be faulted for pandering to , and appeasing , saddam -lrb- whose gassing of the kurds had already begun -rrb- -- in the wake of a single , timorous , hypocritical statement issued in washington in march 1984 criticizing his use of chemical weapons .
the actual toll of the policy to which he was integral would prove so much higher as time passed .
iraqi chemical weapons plants bombed in the 1991 gulf war released agents to which some 100,000 american troops were exposed .
the infamous gulf war syndrome might evend be traced in some measure to the u.s. credits , materiel , and technology rumsfeld knowingly conveyed seven years before .
so , too , of course , could saddam 's brutal 1980s repression of the shia , underlying the sectarian animus and resolve for vengeance and dominance by the u.s. - installed shia regime after 2003 that shaped rumsfeld 's , and america 's , historic failure in iraq .
others colluded at every turn in the long scandal of policy toward iraq .
colin powell , then the chairman of the joint chiefs , and dick cheney , as secretary of defense during the first gulf war , would , for instance , be directly complicit in the syndrome outrage .
yet none of the participants in the larger post / 11 disaster was more directly responsible than rumsfeld .
while reagan 's special envoy was , with his usual energy and sharp elbows , dickering with the iraqis in the mid-1980s , condoleezza rice was an assistant professor of no scholarly distinction at stanford ; cheney a third - term congressman from wyoming squirming up the house leadership ladder ; future viceroy of baghdad l. paul `` jerry '' bremer moving from state department clerk and alexander haig protege to lavish - party giving ambassador to the netherlands ; and george w. bush , still by his own account given to `` heavy drinking , '' absorbed in changing the name of his chronically failed arbusto energy oil company to bush exploration .
waiting game
by 1987 , rumsfeld was flexing his muscles once more , preparing for the ultimate goal , assembling money and party support for a presidential run against george h. w. bush in 1988 .
but after a dozen years out of office , and against the entrenched power of an heir apparent , he would soon enough discover that backing just was not there .
off more recent prominence and with a wider political base , cheney would try to mount his own presidential campaign in the early 1990s , only to meet the same bitter rejection
historians will only guess at the rancor building in these two deeply ambitious , deeply disappointed figures at the president they had , george w. bush , whom they no doubt saw as manifestly , maddeningly inferior .
the rumsfeld - cheney recompense , at vast cost to the nation and world , would be their fierce seizure of power after september 11 , 2001 .
rumsfeld spent the 1990s again in business , becoming ceo of general instruments , then chairman of gilead sciences pharmaceuticals , with another history reminiscent of searle .
in 1990 , he joined the board of abb , a swedish - swiss conglomerate that had gobbled up companies in the latter 1980s , including westinghouse energy operations , and would move aggressively to win a $ 200 - million contract for `` the design and key components '' for light - water nuclear reactors in north korea .
rumsfeld pursued this prize even while chairing a congressional commission on missile threats that found a `` clear danger '' for the future from pyongyang .
in the alarming report , his otherwise fulsome resume failed to mention that he was an abb director .
in 1996 , he took leave from gilead to become chief foreign policy advisor , along with wolfowitz , in robert dole 's failed presidential run .
he would end as the campaign 's eighteen - hour - a - day manager .
by 1997 , amid the full - scale takeover of the washington gop by the long - churning cabal of neoconservatives , he joined cheney and wolfowitz on a newt gingirch - instigated congressional policy advisory board to shape attacks on the second clinton administration .
in january 1998 , he signed the celebrated letter so publicly sent to clinton from the right - wing , israeli lobby - dominated project for a new american century .
alongside wolfowitz , perle , and others soon to be key players in the younger bush 's regime , he vigorously urged the `` removal '' of saddam .
in july 1998 , there followed the `` rumsfeld commission '' report on missile threats , wildly claiming , in an unnamed debut of the `` axis of evil '' drawn from the testimony and staff work of right - wing ideologues , that iran , iraq , and north korea would each be able to `` inflict major destruction '' on the u.s. by 2002 .
through it all , including the first seven - and - a - half months of their rule after the seamy election of 2000 , there would be no trace of the actual danger that erupted out of a september morning sky in 2001 .
though he had repaired surface relations with the bushes , rumsfeld took no major role in the 2000 race .
in any case , the elder bush had erased him from his son 's list of possible running mates , while ultimately waving through cheney , whose reactionary animus had been relatively well masked at the pentagon in 1989 .
when , post-election , cheney vetoed governor tom ridge for the pentagon , and there were throbbing neocon fears that a cosmetic powell , bureaucrat at heart , would be far too equivocal at the state department , rumsfeld would be cheney 's , and so bush 's , antidote .
his appointment was a mark of the extreme poverty of republican talent the administration reflected so graphically .
the supposed party of national security , having held the white house for five of the last eight terms and dominated congress for much of the previous 30 years , had no serious alternative to a man who had perched atop the pentagon a full quarter - century before .
apart from the patently right - wing , widely discredited missile panel he had chaired , rumsfeld had shown no palpable interest or competence in the ever more complex defense issues accumulating since then , much less the rapidly changing politics of the post-cold war world . nonetheless , fit , relatively youthful at 69 , he strode again into the e-ring .
there was speculation that the old halloween massacre goal was still there , that cheney , with his uncertain health , might step aside in 2004 , that the undertaker might yet reach the oval office .
mastery
rumsfeld began his pentagon reprise by seizing on a dead russian marshal and an octogenarian washington bureaucrat few had ever heard of .
like osama bin laden , steely - haired nikolai ogarkov first came to light during the soviet war in afghanistan .
in 1977 , at 50 , he had become a prodigal chief of the soviet general staff .
in that superannuated , medal - mummified company , he proved a dynamic , technically inclined , forward - thinking young general .
over the ensuing years , he would be an impressive moscow spokesman on arms control , and defend stubbornly , even abjectly , the 1983 shooting down of a civilian korean airlines 747 that had veered into soviet air space .
ogarkov would fall from power in a 1984 kremlin struggle over weapons spending , write a valedictory book warning of american militarism , and die in post-soviet obscurity in 1994 .
but his main , if esoteric , historical distinction would lie in a slight 1982 pamphlet in which he blamed the early , nearly lethal russian defeats in world war ii on a failure to adapt to the new german blitzkrieg concepts in tank warfare .
recent u.s. advances in weapons technology , he argued , could leave the russians similarly vulnerable if they did n't adapt quickly enough .
sweeping changes in tactics and arms as well as more agile , responsive armed forces were needed to face the american challenge , the marshal advised .
otherwise , soviet forces would fall into a series of devastating traps on a future remote - targeted battlefield in which the enemy would utilize the latest computerized surveillance and information systems in a new form of high - tech warfare .
his vision soon gained vogue as much in washington as amid the stultified upper reaches of the soviet military of the early 1980s .
it was grandly christened -- and welcomed by pentagon aficionados -- as the `` revolution in military affairs '' or , in that acronym - laden world , rma .
there was a certain banality to ogarkov 's stress on technology .
that a fighting force should be best attuned to the battlefield and adversary of the moment -- modern , adaptable , quick , and informed -- should have been self - evident , on the order of the bloody lesson 80 years before of the tsarist cavalry charging entrenched machine guns in the russo - japanese war .
yet however obvious the premise , the rma concept -- transported to the pentagon and put in the context of an onrushing generation of electronic warfare , of near - nuclear effects with non-nuclear means , along with ogarkov 's call for fresh tactics -lrb- and thus new weaponry and higher spending -rrb- -- was taken up by innovators , opportunists , and their assorted hybrids on both sides of the cold war .
this was particularly so among the soviets , whose rusty europe - heavy military was already being shaken and bled in afghanistan by the mujahideen -- in 1982 , despite ample saudi money , still only partially armed by their cynical cia , pakistani , and chinese handlers .
at any rate , ogarkov 's truism was also grist for the pentagon 's back - ring band of civilian military `` theorists , '' career bureaucrats ever in search of a mission and occupationally disposed to attribute evil genius -- requiring a suitable washington budgetary response -- to the red menace .
short , bald , and with stylishly severe wire - rimmed glasses , andrew marshall was a dickensian clerk of a man who took up the bureaucratic cudgel rma represented and brought it down inside the pentagon .
an economist by training , he had begun at rand as an analyst in the late 1940s , when rumsfeld was still in new trier high school .
marshall was archetypical in the career - making fear and folly of the u.s. - russian mirror - image rivalry .
he had been a protege of think - the - unthinkable , world war iii theorist herman kahn , and then , via henry kissinger 's mentor fritz kraemer , had gone to work for kissinger at the national security council -lrb- nsc -rrb- in the first nixon term .
in 1973 , he moved on to the pentagon where he presided over his own obscure nest , the office of net assessment , from rumsfeld i to ii , while gradually gaining the reputation of resident genius of new war methods .
discreet guru to reactionaries , ignored but thought untouchable by democrats when in power , marshall looked on as the joint chiefs not only spied on kissinger 's arms control negotiations with the russians , but also played an ardent supporting role in nixon 's fall .
he subsequently signed on to rumsfeld i 's denial of defeat in vietnam and then , on rma 's advent , used the concept to evoke ominous fears of a new kremlin military prowess , justifying the orgy of pentagon spending that took place during the reagan era .
-lrb- ironically , of course , ogarkov in 1982 was arguing for a russian response to a still largely prospective american escalation of weaponry and warfare . -rrb-
while the u.s. armaments spree of the 1980s paid for some new rma developments , most of the expenditures fit snugly within the corrupt , obtuse old cold war system , with america 's armed forces tailored to a lumbering soviet threat in europe , and no serious anticipation of the neo-insurgency wars that actually lay ahead .
as marshall toyed with `` flexibility '' -- and the joint chiefs cherry - picked his conjuring of moscow 's might for their own budgetary purposes , while ignoring the real import , and limits , of rma -- the cold war ended in the equivocations and evasions of bill clinton 's two terms in office and the low - rent , self - congratulatory installing of mafia regimes in bosnia and kosovo .
the gnome - like marshall , well past retirement but a lionized witness before the missile - threat commission , hung on for rumsfeld 's return .
the resulting history is far too close for much documented detail , though its silhouette is plain enough .
summoning marshall as soothsayer , rumsfeld made rma the logo of his determination to gain managerial dominance over the joint chiefs and the pentagon bureaucracy , exactly the opportunity he thought he had missed 25 years earlier .
under the old banner of a clash between a brave , beleaguered secretary of defense and the recalcitrant brass astride an impossible , `` glandular '' system , he held up the all - purpose , all - seasons ideal of pentagon `` reform . ''
that `` reform '' movement was to be his ultimate takedown , his claim to greatness , and perhaps -- who knew in 2001 -- one last shot at the presidency .
amid the inevitable claims of `` streamlining '' and `` modernizing , '' democrats applauded and reporters gushed reflexively about rumsfeld as a celebrity ceo and national quipster .
the willing ignorance , denial , careless trust , or craven acquiescence that marked the essential submissiveness of the political and media culture to rumsfeld 's rule were only part of a larger , thoughtless national abdication of judgment and responsibility in the wars he would propel in both afghanistan and iraq .
in blindly striking out after 9 / 11 -- a reflexive , grandly opportunistic , richly self - satisfying political act in america -- without seriously understanding the politics or history of either country , he plunged the pentagon into blundering , plundering occupations that made the nightmares of 2007 and beyond nearly inevitable .
that was the price -- in the utter absence of serious dialogue in the 2000 election or the first eight months of 2001 -- of the original uncontested surrender of foreign - policy power and initiative to such evident presidential incompetence -lrb- including the shocking ineptitude of nsc advisor condoleezza rice and her staff -rrb- and the long predictable rumsfeld - cheney dominance .
all of it was plain in washington soon after george w. bush 's arrival in the oval office ; none of it was then questioned , much less challenged , by congress , the remnant foreign policy establishment , or the mainstream media .
no democratic process so completely failed a test of substance as america 's after 9 / 11 .
no ensuing catastrophe was more consensual .
history will unravel only slowly rumsfeld 's relationship to the neocons , who dominated the middle and upper reaches of his pentagon , a relationship more complex than contemporary hagiographies or demonologies have had it .
historically , he was their ally , patron , legitimizing figurehead , but never really of them , never a fellow ideologue , dogmatist , or slavish adherent to much of what they pursued .
in enlisting wolfowitz , perle and their train , he would use them , much as he used marshall , as he had used so many before , as a means to what was so largely a personal , megalomaniacal end .
but that use , too , was characteristically heedless of substance and cost .
he opened government as never before to men who habitually , automatically assumed that u.s. and israeli interests were identical , with no objectivity about american policy in a middle east they scarcely understood to begin with .
their ignorance and presumption were matched only by their zeal to cluster in decisive quarters of the new bush regime where decisions of grand strategy , of war and peace , were now shaped and predetermined .
`` like cancer cells , '' as eyewitness , lieutenant colonel karen kwiakowski , would describe them in action in rumsfeld 's defense department .
half - educated and fanatically loyal to the rote israeli lobby view of the middle east and the larger neocon craze for american post-cold war global hegemony , they crowded the domains of the number three official at the pentagon , undersecretary of defense for policy douglas feith , whose career was a model of their kind and whose notorious office of special plans was created as a fount for the fraudulent intelligence spurring the invasion of iraq .
historians will debate , too , the obvious blurred allegiance of what some call these american `` likudniks '' with their utter conformity to the belligerent ultra-zionist mentality of the israeli right .
never before -- not even in the post-world war ii heyday of the powerful china lobby with its formidable grip on capitol hill but not within the upper reaches of the executive itself -- had so many of such uncritical adherence to the policies of a foreign power been so well placed in washington .
as often in american politics and government , however , no conspiracies were necessary , though a pentagon - israeli lobby spy scandal has yet to be played out .
unrelieved substantive shallowness , a perversely narrow sociology of knowledge , long - jockeyed - for power and career advancement , a grandiose parochial vision of a pax americana world nursed in a hundred forgotten think - tank papers and incestuous conferences -- all that as well imposed a stifling , disastrous orthodoxy on the administration .
not least , they operated without the need to support their prejudices or delusions in authentic high - level debate , flourishing in their members - only domains of the pentagon , the nsc staff , and the state department , enjoying exclusive channels of communication to the white house controlled by cheney , and unchallenged under a president of uniquely closed mind .
as for rumsfeld 's relations with his generals , the subject of veiled accusations of his heedlessness to dissent or running roughshod over warnings of serious problems , we actually know very little .
the calamity in iraq has brought more public criticism by senior officers than any other war in american history , including vietnam , but almost all of it hurled from the relatively safe seats of two - and three-star retirement -- and forlornly after the fact .
this much is clear :
no major pentagon leaks , the time - honored washington weapon of dissenting commanders , marked the run - up to the invasion .
there have been no public resignations in protest of his policies .
and the negligence , incompetence , and inertia of commanders in recognizing and coping with the insurgency , in dealing with scandals of prisoner abuse , inadequate equipment and more , have been all too obvious .
there is no evidence that any ranking american officer on duty pressed an intellectual or moral challenge to the unfolding debacle -- even after it was too glaring to be ignored .
as in so much else in his long record , rumsfeld enjoyed , by washington 's inimitable mix of careerism and cowardice , submission and opportunism , a large supporting cast in his folly .
takedown
in the exhilarating dash to baghdad in 2003 , none of the admiring gallery seemed to notice that rumsfeld 's `` new '' military was largely the old one , `` reformed '' in name only ; nor did many note that the vaunted lean , mean machine of rma and the again - lionized marshall had no grasp of how profoundly political was the act of overthrowing 40 years of ba rule ; how deeply political was the campaign to which so many american lives , so much of the country 's material and symbolic national treasures , would be committed .
rumsfeld would take his victory tour in the gulf that spring as if circling the mat after a stunningly swift pin .
what was his toughest call , trailing reporters asked -- part of the traditional garlands of victory tossed his way -- and how did he `` feel '' at such a victorious moment ?
it was hardly the time for the media , the seemingly omnipotent military , or the rest of government and the political culture to reflect on how much `` shock and awe '' depended on overwhelming force brought down on the near - defenseless , on how much the concept reeked of racism and colonial pretense - of natives on the scene and in the vicinity `` shocked and awed '' like zulus pounded and panicked by the queen 's own latest howitzers .
it was far too early for other questions -- about a force cosseted at the end of vulnerable supply lines , nicely photogenic in night goggles but without enough body armor ; about acronyms like ied that had yet to enter the vocabularies of either commanders or reporters ; about the familiar chase for medals and the absence of an enemy admitting defeat and ready to surrender -lrb- a missing essential of `` victory '' that would have much worried maxwell taylor -rrb- .
unreformed , uninformed commanders , uninstructed beyond brief battles , led their charges into iraq relying on their generals .
the generals relied on civilians .
the civilians relied on -lrb- or were seduced or bullied by -rrb- the neocons .
the neocons relied on their own ersatz expertise , mossad insiders , and iraqi exiles long out of touch with their homeland .
the exiles -- holed up in baghdad palaces with u.s. - paid - for mercenary guards , ignorant and contemptuous of the iraq that had passed them by , and where they were now powerless , even with the might of the pentagon behind them -- relied on the americans .
rumsfeld , as always , relied on himself . the ranks trusted him -- and political decision - makers -- to know and manage post-saddam politics in iraq to secure the victory as well as to provide the political setting that fulfilled the military triumph .
when they failed miserably , condemning the american force to a corrupt , untenable occupation and slow - wasting attrition of men and prestige , the debacle was complete .
beyond iraq were his other lasting legacies .
as no other cabinet officer in history , he turned over crucial , self - sustaining functions of his department to privateers and private armies .
he surrendered vital supply and commissariat services for the american military to profit - plundering contractors for whom u.s. forces were neither fellow warriors , nor even share - holders , but captive `` customers '' to be treated with the offhandedness afforded by guaranteed contracts .
he ceded security and combat functions essential to the national mission to a corps of thousands of hired guns whose qualifications , standards of conduct and ultimate loyalty -- all integral to the safety and success of american forces -- were beyond effective governmental control or measure .
-lrb- exposed in a congressional hearing february 7 , the scandal of the infamous blackwell security corporation , shirking amid vast profit the arming and protection of its own ranks , would be only a glimpse of the larger disgrace . -rrb-
not since the british hired hordes of hessians to crush george washington 's revolutionary army had a military force tracing to america been so utterly mercenary .
the potential direct and indirect levy on policy and the armed forces would not be known for years .
as no other cabinet officer in history , he squandered the integrity of his department and the unique , indispensable code of honor of its services .
he joined , and often led , the rest of an intellectually degraded administration , heedless of constitutional and human rights , in violating the very heart of their ostensibly conservative convictions .
with the ready sanctioning , and then de facto cover - up of torture and abuse at abu ghraib , guantanamo , and the less noticed but equally gruesome prisons at bagram air base and elsewhere in afghanistan , he changed , for untold millions , the symbol of america and its once - proud military from freedom and the rule of law to the unforgettable prisoner 's hood and shackles .
rumsfeld 's impact would not vanish with terms of office or elections .
by the very nature of contracts , personnel practices , and imparted ethics -- some of washington 's most permanent monuments -- his legacies would remain deep in the tissue and soul of the institution he was entrusted to lead .
at the end , a pathetic climax to his more than four decades either in government or imploringly on its threshold , there was only his hackneyed memo on iraq policy -- leaked , even more pathetically , in an apparent attempt somehow to vindicate him after all .
thus , he growled that the iraqi regime , like some seedy wrestling team , should `` pull up its socks '' ; and , most poignantly , ever the politician conducting lethal policy as politics , he advised that washington `` announce that whatever new approach the us decides on , the us is doing so on a trial basis .
this will give us the ability to re-adjust and move to another course , if necessary , and therefore not ' lose . ' ''
as he left office for the last time , it would be only the loss that mattered .
as a pathologically unfit president struggled to recoup his historic blunder , as the neocons and israeli lobby pressed on a gullible media and restive but still captive congress the myth of an iranian nuclear threat , as the navy and air force , lesser actors in the iraq action , promised wondrous results in persia , the chaos and ineffable danger were left to robert gates , the puffy courtier .
weeks after rumsfeld 's departure , history -- the little ever really known or understood -- was already being waved off , forgotten .
the past was too complicated and troublesome , too guilt - ridden and close to home , too filled with chilling consequences .
the worst of it was the most basic and damning .
donald rumsfeld and all he represented , all he did and did not do , came out of us .
the undertaker 's tally , including iraq , was compiled at our leave , one way or another , at every turn .
his tragedy was always ours .
roger morris , who served in the state department and on the senior staff of the national security council under presidents johnson and nixon , resigned in protest at the invasion of cambodia .
he then worked as a legislative advisor in the u.s. senate and a director of policy studies at the carnegie endowment , and writes this rumsfeldian history from intimate firsthand knowledge as well as extensive research .
a visiting honors professor at the university of washington and research fellow of the green institute -lrb- his work appears on its website -lsb- 3 -rsb- -rrb- , he is an award - winning historian and investigative journalist , including a national book award silver medal winner , and the author of books on nixon , kissinger , haig , and the clintons .
more recently , he co-authored with sally denton the money and the power -lsb- 4 -rsb- , a history of las vegas as the paradigm of national corruption . his latest work , shadows of the eagle , a history of u.s. covert interventions and policy in the middle east and south asia over the past half - century , will be published in 2007 by knopf .

our most epic road trips writing about the black canyon left me thinking of other ' epic ' climbing road trips i 've actually survived .
and this , of course , brought back memories that made me suddenly laugh out loud in inappropriate places .
first among them while standing in line at some typically dull so - cal caffeine-o-torium waiting to beg for my morning fix :
i suddenly started laughing so hard i was like snorting out minor body parts through my nose .
suffice to say that all the local rotarians and vfw heroes so desperate as to have voluntarily rocketed down to their local strip mall before dawn backed away from me hard , then stared at me like i had suddenly dropped my pants and started , er , ' amusing myself ' in a public place .
-lrb- i know that specific look because i once ... um , never mind -rrb-
so anyway , it dawned on me as all those oh - so - serious professionals back peddled away from me , i bet that there are oodles of absolute pant - wetter road trip stories lingering out there among my brothers and sisters on the . wreck ripe just ripe for the picking --
if only they were inspired to show and tell all .
~~~
so i ask you , what was your most epic road trip ?
do tell ...
~~~
i chose the word `` epic '' with some care .
for what we 're looking for here is not necessarily your best road trip ever -lrb- ie , `` so we met up just after work and got there early ,
then we climbed everything on our wish list on our first try , then drove home without incident ... '' --
good for you , but hardly worth writing , or reading .
at the other extreme , your worst road trip ever would hardly warrant a recap ,
-lrb- ie , `` `` my prom date called and dumped me , then the other two clowns finally showed up hammered and four hours late .
and 10 minutes out of town , we blew a head gasket ... '' --
this also hardly worth writing , or reading .
we 're looking for epic ,
the best story you ever stumbled through and survived .
something with drunken rodeo clowns , the ' professional lady ' named larry you met in the overnight lot at that truck stop , angry state troopers , blood everywhere , ...
you know , that kind of thing .
do , pray , tell all .
i promise to only laugh at the punch lines .
and i promise to fess up eventually and tell of at least one such epic i survived --
that is once you big kids have me laughing so hard i forget about all those ancient blood oaths i swore never to say a word ... canis fidelus est ,

well ... it began with blowing out a tire but then drifted into i - might - tell - you - one - day territory ... but ended with driving back from newhalem to seattle with me holding my breath to lighten the load on the replacement tire , an exercise deriving from a state of mind which helps to keep one awake .
there was also a time when i agreed to atomic mouse 's suggestion to follow a watercourse near sabie downhill one afternoon .
it was him , me , 'nita , and my 8 year old daughter and 10 year old son .
down and down we went wading through the sparkling water , first broad and shallow then narrow with deep pools .
i 'm certain that neither a.m. or myself will ever lose the sharp frozen second as 'nita put her head under water and then threw it back with her long hair and an arc of water saying youth and grace in perfect agreement .
and sexy .
then more descent , sometimes through the jungle on either side to bypass falls .
now it was getting dark .
it was cold .
sometimes the stream bottom dropped away and we fell in over our heads .
there was whimpering from all except 'nita , our rock of unshakable womanly determination .
just as the last light faded we made it to the place where a trail left the water and led back to the car now a couple hundred meters above us .
only a.m. had not foreseen the chance that the escape he used the last time could have become overgrown with brambles .
he was sent off into the dark to find another way , which he did ,
and although at times one of us had to do a step of 5th class and then reach back for the children standing on the shoulders of the other , we made the all - important deadline of finding an open restaurant before 9 pm . 'nita was composed and lovely in the candlelight ,
the children were glad to be alive ,
a.m. spun his tales ,
and i put off tick removal until morning .
that was the end to a day which had offered many other adventures , the scariest for me being a swim in a stream -lrb- a different stream -rrb- to rinse off the red mud of a cave .
scary because i had doubts about reassurances of safety issuing from a companion who admitted to several bouts with bilharzia and tick fever .
after reading dogboy 's black canyon post i had the same thought he did ; that there must be other such stories .
i 've already told most of mine .
however , after watching dr. nigel spivey tell us how art made the world -lrb- ''it is n't every day you walk around with a 16 -lrb- or 60 ? -rrb- million dollar piece of limestone in your hand . '' -rrb- i learn that i 've re-discovered a 40,000 year - old trick of story - telling .
use a soundtrack .
so in a recurring offer , to anyone who provides a mailing address , i will send a set of quicktime slide shows that are guaranteed to make you laugh , whether with me or at me .
just please use decent sound , something with sub-woofer if possible .
andy cairns
so nice seeing an experience from another perspective , thanks andy . that was some time ago
but i 'm glad to see that it has 'nt blunted your memory of the day .
i do however have the disconcerting feeling that you read my diary though .
i quite think the blouberg trip we went on deserving of epic status .
-lrb- strange thing that ; have you ever noticed how some times it 's more like the trip going on you ? -rrb-
like the trip going on you ? -rrb-
like the trip going on you ? -rrb-
the scale of the adventure that awaited us must have been evident to you as we started out on the trip , since you took 2 beacon sparkles as emergency rations , instead of just 1 .
still ; the view from the top was all the better for the road we chose -lrb- or guessed -rrb- to get there .
atomic mouse
brothers cairns and mouse , in the same time zone at the same time , ah the very thought of just that absolutely screams epic .
having been more than once strung out 30+ feet above some rusty spinner of a paleo bolt-ette in the calanques , way way over my head and doing my bad elvis impersonation , i can easily imagine a truly priceless handful of limestone .
hell , even just a tiny little crimper 's worth .
yeeesh ...
having said that , i saw that said same dr. spivey piece on pbs -- a while ago at some no - tell -lrb- '' big earl 's stop - n - flop '' , if memory serves -rrb-
the tv was chained to the wall ,
and i assure you there was no remote .
that and the sheets were the consistency of waxed paper .
after i woke / sobered up , i found this one ruby red stiletto heeled slipper that was big even on me .
my first thought was `` cool , i wonder if i can find the other one . ''
moments later my second thought was `` oooch , i think need to shower immediately , then touch nothing ... ''
well , at least the price was right .
for the guy behind the -lrb- bullet proof glass -- big earl himself ? -rrb- at first said ' 50 bucks an hour . '
then i said ' um , how much for all night ? '
at which he looked at me really funny and said ' er , fifty bucks ' .
and i said ' well -- can i see the room first ?
at which he looked at me really really funny and said ' ok , how 'bout 18 bucks . '
at which i said ' deal ! '
then i said ' er , i assume you want cash '
to which he said ' d' yah think !? '
you laugh , but when was the last time you rented a no - tell room for less than 20 bucks -lrb- that 's a night -- not an hour , lord slime -rrb-
that or found a free size 12 -lrb- mens ' , ee wide -rrb- ruby red slipper ?
that or had some drunken squid who just happened to also have a key to your room suddenly crash in in the middle of the night , flip the mattress over -lrb- with you on it -- well , suddenly not on it -rrb- , then calmly scoop up the revealed colt '45 and say `` oh , i 'm sorry to wake you , you want a beer ? ''
well i rest my case .
or , as warren harding once said : `` at either end of the social spectrum , there lies a leisure class . ''
ok , i 've since been told it is properly attributed to eric beck .
but i met harding once , late in his life -lrb- though neither of us dreamed that at the time -rrb- by an ' unauthorized ' campfire under cloud 's rest .
and he said just that to me .
and if there was ever anyone who would understand that line , it was harding .
or at least the harding i met .
before that night , i had taken my pals ' word for it and believed i was entirely nuts and a really good climber .
after that night , i realized i was n't all that especially nuts , nor was i all that especially much of a climber .
warren was magically , well , different .
trust me on this , if nothing else .
~~~
so where was i ...
oh yeah , dr. spivey .
and neanderthals .
-lrb- and warren harding -rrb-
neanderthals are dear to me , for they are surely my tribe
-lrb- if you 'd ever been to a wedding within my clan down at the elk 's lodge , you 'd know -rrb- .
i 've read a lot about them , one of my favorite repasts .
now most of our subspecies assume that just because we happened to eek past them in darwin 's sieve , they were dopes .
ah but not so --
just look at the archeology .
for big science has found burials surrounded by literally pounds of pollen .
as in flowers , piles of them .
the fact that there was any burial at , to my mind , speaks volumes of them .
add the flowers , and well , to my mind , that 's poetry .
oh if only they had a written language --
well , one that we can find .
big science has also found burials of neanderthal elders -lrb- ie , like 50+ - a near miracle then , albeit it no more than late adolescence now -rrb- -- who had demonstrably been brutally hobbled since early childhood .
like broken hips , femurs , even -lrb- in one case -rrb- a snapped spine -- all trauma endured as children as now easily proved given ' modern ' techniques .
and yet they survived another 40 years to be buried in mounds of flowers .
how did that happen ?
or more to the point , why ?
we call them ' cavemen ' and relinquish them to ape status .
why ?
of late i 've come to ask if i 'd rather be surrounded by neanderthals or the graduating class of the stanford mba program .
the answer comes surprisingly easy .
~~~
um right , ok , what else .
clearly the gods read my last post and were obviously inspired to offer still more inspiration for reflection on the epic road trip front -lrb- nudge nudge -rrb- via the morning news .
first they offered word of astronut lisa nowak 's epic road trip from houston -lrb- mission control even , oh purrfect , well done zeus -rrb- to orlando .
i personally nominate nowak for . wreck road trip points in both the technique and packing list categories .
the former for dreaming up an idea sure to revolutionize road trips -- wearing a diaper to avoid the need for pit stops and hence shave precious seconds off travel time .
genius !
why did n't i think of that ?
i for one am off to bobmart for a carton of depends .
sure hope i get there before all the frustrated la commuters buy up all the national inventory .
as for nowak 's packing list , according to cnn it included : a wig , sunglasses , a trench coat , several large plastic garbage bags , a half dozen latex gloves , mapquest directions , `` diapers nowak said she wore to reduce stops along the highway '' , a wad of undelivered love letters , and oh yeah , about $ 600 in cash
imagine all the fun one could have with all that stuff .
beats even the contents of the `` plan r survival kit '' slim pickins ' inventories in dr. stranglove .
suffice to say all of the above are now on my bobmart shopping list .
it 's the rubber tubing part that i suspect is really giving the woman nowak `` just wanted to talk to '' a whopping case of the heebie geebies .
`` hell hath no fury ... ''
~~~
the morning news also included mention of the passing of frankie lane , the man who gave us what is certainly the best road trip tune ever -- `` rawhide ! ''
i remember while howling back from a long weekend in squamish , after listening to the mighty original a few times with all the windows down -lrb- this in order to invoke a much needed second wind at about 3am on i -rrb- i crooned a variation on this deathless standard to inspire my then sweetheart -lrb- and still dear pal -rrb- who was cramming for an organic chem final
-lrb- she had carried her notes with her all weekend , even had her head buried in them while belaying me on grand wall .
a real confidence builder to look down from the shaky crux and see that .
ah yeeesh -rrb-
'' bondin' bondin' bondin' keep that carbon bondin' formaldehyde !!!! -lrb- & etc -rrb- ''
my beloved abby was , oddly , not amused .
she loudly invoked the wrath of the gods -lrb- see above -rrb- down upon my pointy little head .
and , remarkably , she got it .
for seconds later there was this tuly blinding flash as lightning hit an unlucky tree just a few hundred in front of us and off on the side of the road .
and the thunderous crash that followed shook us into the adjoining lane .
that and no more than a minute later , as i attempted to slither between two of those big open stake trucks they use to haul live cattle , there was yet another mighty blast of lightning close by .
this apparently caused a whole lot of tightly packed cows to suddenly and simultaneously group - shit themselves , as we were instantly enveloped in the mother of all shit storms .
literally .
it was so thick my windshield wipers just stopped .
it got suddenly pitch black inside the car as every inch of glass was buried in cow shit .
this at , um , 12 hours divided by two , times five , plus about 65 equals , um , something like 95 mph .
caught tight between two tractor trailers howling -lrb- bleating ? -rrb- down some steep pass somewhere in southern oregon .
suffice to say i nearly shit myself as well .
for i could do nothing but take my foot off the gas , aim kinda straight , and start chanting from the tibetan book of the dead .
abby , always the cool head , rolled down her window -lrb- and was immediately rewarded with a lapful of still warm poop -rrb- , allowing me to slither over onto the shoulder of the road in an almost controlled manner .
there we used a snow scraper , all was left in our water bottles -lrb- not much - for who would have anticipated _that_ -rrb- , a big unopened jug of gatorade , and a bottle of nondescript chardonnay to clear just enough of a porthole in the mighty poop wad on the windshield to allow us to actually find , then limp into , ashland .
there we sat at this dark gas station with a drive through car wash waiting for it to open .
abby again immersed in her org chem book , seemingly nonplussed , me thwapping my head against the steering wheel chanting `` this is n't happening ... ''
when the guy -lrb- the owner , it turned out -rrb- arrived to open the gas station , he took one look at our cow pie with wheels and said `` what the fook ? ''
then he noticed we were parked at the mouth of his drive through car wash and said `` there 's no _way_ i 'm gon na let you use my car wash ! ''
though in the end he proved not to be a complete turd -- as he gave us detailed directions to his competitor 's coin operated self serve / self spray car wash on the other side of town .
that and broke our remaining 40 bucks of cash into a half ton of quarters .
and we used every last quarter , for panicked cow cow - poop is like epoxy -- if you did n't already know that ...
~~~
sure , you 're all

blouberg was epic on my scale , involving as it did a king , a big snake , germans and a policeman disappearing on the mountain , advice on how to kill a python , and bears some relevance to the recent thread on getting lost
-lrb- do you think hal should add some advice in his book bringing yourself back alive about maps provided by rupert ? -rrb-
, oh , yeah , and the guy looking for his cow with a hatchet , but the epic status was compromised when we were descending the mountain and met the schoolgirls coming up it on their way home .
i do n't think any part of that trip translates well to north american experiences , except for the thunderstorm coming on just as we were near a cave .
but the real assignment was on road trips . ^,,^ would probably find any trip you ever made in the slut to be of interest .

and that was when you were finally a peace with the decision to not buy a convertable , was n't it ?

january 1966 .
in nigeria a civil war was going on .
i was a correspondent covering the war .
on a cloudy day i left lagos .
i was driving along a road where they say no white man can come back alive . i was driving to see if a white man could , because i had to experience everything for myself .
i know that a man shudders in the forest when he passes close to a lion .
i got close to a lion so that i would know how it feels .
i had to do it myself because i knew that no one could describe it to me .
and i can not describe it myself .
nor can i describe a night in the sahara .
the stars over the sahara are enormous .
they sway above the sand like great chandeliers .
the light of those stars is green .
night in the sahara is as green as a mazowsze* meadow .
i drove up a hill
and when i got to the crest i could see the first flaming roadblock down below .
burning logs blocked the road .
i slowed down and then stopped ;
it would have been impossible to have carried on .
i could see a dozen or so young people .
some had shotguns ,
some were holding knives
and the rest were armed with machetes .
they were dressed alike in blue shirts with white sleeves , the colours of the opposition , of the upga .
they wore black and white caps with the letters upga .
they had pictures of chief awolowo pinned to their shirts .
chief awolowo was the leader of the opposition , the idol of the party .
they must have been smoking hashish because their eyes were mad
and they did not look fully conscious .
they were soaked in sweat , seemed possessed , frenzied .
they descended on me and pulled me out of the car .
i could hear them shouting ' upga ! upga ! '
on this road upga ruled .
upga held me in its sway .
i could feel three knife points against my back
and i saw several machetes aimed at my head .
two activists stood a few steps away , pointing their guns at me in case i tried to get away .
my african experience had taught me that the worst thing to do in such situations is to betray your despair .
the most important thing was keeping still .
keeping still takes practice and willpower , because everything inside screams that you should run for it or jump the other guy .
but they are always in groups and that means certain death .
i had to cover all my weaknesses , hide them somewhere very deep within myself .
this was africa ,
i was in africa .
they did not know that i was not their enemy .
they knew that i was white ,
and the only white they had known was the colonizer , who abased them .
the ones standing in the road wanted cash .
they wanted me to join the party , to become a member of upga and to pay for it .
i gave them five shillings .
that was too little , because somebody hit me on the back of the head .
i felt pain in my skull .
in a moment there was another blow .
after the third blow i felt an enormous tiredness .
i was fatigued and sleepy ;
i asked how much they wanted .
they wanted five pounds .
everything in africa was getting more expensive .
in the congo soldiers were accepting people into the party for one pack of cigarettes and one blow with a rifle butt .
but here i had already got it a couple of times
and i was still supposed to pay five pounds .
i must have hesitated because the boss shouted to the activists , ' burn the car ! '
and that car , the peugeot that had been carrying me around africa , was not mine .
it belonged to the polish state .
one of them splashed gasoline on the peugeot .
i understood that the discussion had ended and i had no way out .
i gave them the five pounds .
they started fighting over it .
but they allowed me to drive on .
two boys moved the burning logs aside .
i looked around .
on both sides of the road there was a village and the village crowd had been watching the action .
the people were silent ;
somebody in the crowd was holding up a upga banner .
they all had photographs of chief awolowo pinned on their shirts .
i liked the girls best .
they were naked to the waist and had the name of the party written across their breasts : up on the right breast , and ga on the left one .
i started off .
i could not turn back ;
they allowed me only to go forward .
so i kept driving through a country at war , a cloud of dust behind me .
the landscape was beautiful here , all vivid colours ,
africa the way i like it .
quiet , empty - every now and then a bird taking flight in the path of the car .
now i knew the price :
upga had demanded five pounds of me .
i had less than five pounds left , and fifty kilometres to go .
i passed a burning village and then an emptying village , people fleeing into the bush .
two goats grazed by the roadside and smoke hung above the road .
beyond the village there was another burning roadblock .
activists in upga uniforms , knives in their hands , were kicking a driver who did not want to pay his membership fee .
nearby stood a bloody , beaten man -
he had n't been able to come up with the dues , either .
everything looked like the first roadblock .
at this one , though , i had n't even managed to announce my desire to join upga before i received a pair of hooks to the midsection and had my shirt torn .
they turned my pockets out and took all my money .
i was waiting for them to set me on fire , because upga was burning many people alive .
i had seen the burnt corpses .
the boss at this roadblock popped me one in the face
and i felt a warm sweetness in my mouth .
then he poured benzene on me ,
because here they burn people in benzene :
it guarantees complete incineration .
i felt an animal fear , a fear that struck me with paralysis ;
i stood rooted to the ground , as if i was buried up to the neck .
i could feel the sweat flowing over me ,
but under my skin i was as cold as if standing naked in sub-zero frost .
i wanted to live , but life was abandoning me .
i wanted to live , but i did not know how to defend my life .
my life was going to end in inhuman torment .
my life was going to go out in flames .
the boss of the operation stuffed my money into his pocket and shouted at me , blasting me with his beery breath : ' power !
upga must get power !
we want power !
upga is power ! '
he was shaking , swept up in the passion of power ;
he was mad on power ;
the very word ' power ' sent him into ecstasy , into the highest rapture .
his face was flooding sweat , the veins on his forehead were bulging
and his eyes were shot with blood and madness .
he was happy
and he began to laugh in joy .
they all started laughing .
that laughter saved me .
they ordered me to drive on .
about four kilometres down the road the third roadblock was burning .
the road was straight and i could see the smoke a long way off ,
and then i saw the fire and the activists .
i could not turn back .
there were two barriers behind me .
i could only go forward .
i was trapped , falling out of one ambush into another .
but now i was out of money for ransom , and i knew that if i did n't pay up they would burn the car .
above all , i did n't want another beating .
i had been whipped , my shirt was in tatters
and i reeked of benzene .
there was only one way out : to run the roadblock .
it was risky because i might wreck the car or it might catch fire .
but i had no choice .
i floored it .
the roadblock was a kilometre ahead .
the speedometer needle jumped : 110 , 120 , 140 .
the car shimmied
and i gripped the wheel more tightly .
i leaned on the horn .
when i was right on top of it i could see that the bonfire stretched all the way across the road .
the activists were waving their knives for me to stop . i saw that two of them were winding up to throw bottles of gasoline at the car and for a second i thought , so , this is the end ,
this is the end , but there was no turning back .
there was no turning ...
i smashed into the fire ,
the car jumped ,
there was a hammering against the belly pan ,
sparks showered over the windshield .
and suddenly - the roadblock , the fire and the shouting were behind me .
the bottles had missed .
hounded by terror i drove another kilometre
and then i stopped to make sure the car was n't on fire .
it was n't on fire .
i was all wet .
all my strength had left me ;
i was incapable of fighting ;
i was wide open , defenceless .
i sat down on the sand and felt sick to my stomach .
everything around me was alien .
an alien sky and alien trees . alien hills and manioc fields .
